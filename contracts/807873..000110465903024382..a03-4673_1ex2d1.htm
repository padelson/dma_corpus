ARTICLE III

  



  

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

  



  

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Sicor, Teva, Merger
Sub or any holder of any capital stock of Sicor, Teva or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $.001 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Teva-Owned Stock_.  Each share of
Sicor Common Stock, and any other shares of capital stock of Sicor, that is
owned by Sicor directly or indirectly or by Teva, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Teva shall automatically be retired and shall cease to be
outstanding, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Sicor Common Stock_. Subject to Section 3.3, each issued
and outstanding share of Sicor Common Stock (other than shares of Sicor
Common Stock to be retired in accordance with Section 3.1(b)), including each
Right attached thereto, whether or not then vested or subject to a repurchase
option in favor of Sicor, shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
0.1906 (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4, the " _Conversion Number_
") ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.10 each, of Teva, duly issued and
credited as fully paid (the " _Teva Ordinary Shares_ ") which will trade in
the United States in the form of American Depositary Shares (" _Teva ADSs_
"), evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (" _Teva ADRs_ ") (together
with cash in lieu of fractional shares as specified in Section 3.2, the "
_Teva Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) $16.50 in cash, without interest (the
" _Cash Consideration_ ," and together with the Teva Stock Consideration, the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). Each Teva ADS represents one Teva Ordinary
Share.

  



  

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Sicor Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease
to be outstanding, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Sicor Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive upon the surrender
of such certificates (for each share of Sicor Common Stock previously
represented thereby) the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) _Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Sicor Common Stock under the Sicor Stock Plans (a " _Sicor
Option_ "), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Teva
and shall automatically be converted into an option to purchase Teva Ordinary
Shares in the form of Teva ADSs, to be evidenced by Teva ADRs upon exercise,
in an amount and at an exercise price as determined in accordance with this
Section 3.1(d). Teva shall assume each Sicor Stock Plan to the extent
necessary to assume the Sicor Options and, in the event Teva does not have
sufficient registered Teva ADRs to cover the

  



  

3      
   



  

assumed Sicor Options, Teva shall, as promptly as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a
Registration Statement with respect to the Teva ADSs issuable upon the
exercise thereof and shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable
after the date of such filing (and in any event prior to the Effective Time)
and to comply with state securities law and "blue sky" laws with respect
thereto.  Each Sicor Option so assumed will be subject to, and exercisable
and vested on, the same terms and conditions as under such Sicor Option as of
the Effective Time, except that each assumed Sicor Option shall constitute
an option to acquire that number of Teva ADSs (rounded down to the nearest
number of whole Teva ADSs on a holder-by-holder basis) equal to (a) the
number of Teva ADSs that the holder of such Sicor Option would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such
Sicor Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time _plus_ (b) a
number of Teva ADSs determined by dividing (i) the amount of Cash
Consideration that the holder of such Sicor Option would have been entitled
to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such Sicor Option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time _by_ (ii) the ****
closing price per ADS of Teva ADSs on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Effective Time as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (" _Nasdaq_
") National Market System on the Business Day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, at an exercise price per Teva ADS (rounded up to the nearest
whole penny) equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of
Sicor Common Stock which otherwise could have been purchased pursuant to such
Sicor Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y) the
aggregate number of Teva ADSs deemed to be purchasable (the sum of the amount
in clauses (a) and (b) above) pursuant to such assumed Sicor Option pursuant
to and in accordance with this Section 3.1(d). The conversion of the Sicor
Options provided for in this Section 3.1(d) with respect to any options which
are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as such term is defined in
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
")) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

3.2 _Exchange of Share Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Teva shall designate The Bank of New York, which currently
acts as the depository for the ADSs, or another U.S. bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Sicor (in such capacity, the " _Depository_ "), to
act as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the holders of shares of Sicor
Common Stock and Sicor Options in connection with the Merger and the payment
of the Merger Consideration or other payment to which holders of shares of
Sicor Common Stock and Sicor Options shall become entitled pursuant
to Section 3.1. Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Teva or Merger Sub shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent (i) cash in an aggregate amount equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Sicor Common Stock issued and outstanding (and
not to be retired pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Sicor Outstanding Shares_ ") _multiplied by_ (B) the
Cash Consideration, (ii) **** certificates evidencing a sufficient number of
Teva Ordinary Shares as would permit the Exchange Agent to issue Teva ADRs
evidencing the number of Teva ADSs equal to the product of (A) the Sicor
Outstanding Shares _multiplied_ by (B) the Teva Stock Consideration and (iii)
such additional number of Teva ADRs evidencing Teva ADSs as are required to
pay to the holders of Sicor Options the amounts contemplated by Section
3.1(d).  The deposit made by Teva or Merger Sub, as the case may be, pursuant
to this Section 3.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund._ "
The Exchange Agent shall

  



  

4      
   



  

cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of
Sicor Common Stock and Sicor Options and (ii) applied promptly to making the
payments provided for in Section 3.1. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement;
provided, that Teva may direct the Exchange Agent invest the Exchange Fund in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. **** Any interest or
other income resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to Teva.
Teva shall, prior to the Effective Time, allot Teva Ordinary Shares referred
to in Sections 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) as designated by Sicor subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of shares of Sicor Common Stock at the
Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Teva and
Sicor may reasonably agree and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (such
instructions shall include instructions for the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered on the transfer books of Sicor, subject to the
receipt of appropriate documentation for such transfer).  Upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or evidence of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2(b), the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article III, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
 No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of shares of Sicor Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Sicor, payment may be issued to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Sicor Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such
issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establishes to the satisfaction of Teva and Sicor that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable.

  



  

No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
Teva constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered until such Certificates are
surrendered as provided in this Section 3.2.  Following such surrender, in
addition to the Merger Consideration, there shall be paid, without interest,
to the Person in whose name the securities of Teva have been registered, (i)
at the time of surrender, the amount of all dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the
date of such surrender with respect to such securities and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such securities.

  



  

5      
   



  

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general
or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate,
trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any
kind or nature.

  



  

(c) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of Sicor of shares of Sicor Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
relating to the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Sicor or holders of Sicor Options one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Teva, the Surviving Corporation or
another Subsidiary of Teva, as may be designated by Teva or the
Surviving Corporation. Any stockholders of Sicor or holder of Sicor Options
who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to Teva for payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of
their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Teva, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Sicor Common Stock or holder of Sicor
Options for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Teva, the posting by such Person of a
bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the shares of
Sicor Common Stock represented by such Certificate pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Teva ADSs will be issued and any
holder of shares of Sicor Common Stock entitled to receive a fractional Teva
ADS but for this Section 3.2(f) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment
in lieu thereof, which payment shall represent such holders proportionate
interest in the net proceeds for the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of
such holder of the aggregate fractional Teva ADS that such holder otherwise
would be entitled to receive. Any such sale shall be made by the
Exchange Agent within five (5) Business Days after the date upon which the
Certificate (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof) that would otherwise
result in the issuance of such fractional Teva ADSs has been received by the
Exchange Agent.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Teva and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any Person pursuant to this Article III such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
provision of any federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If Teva or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Sicor

  



  

6      
   



  

Common Stock in respect of which Teva or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

3.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. (a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Sicor Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive,
subject to and net of any applicable withholding of Taxes, payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held
by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.2, of the
Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(b) Sicor shall give Teva (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by Sicor, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served on or otherwise received by Sicor pursuant to the DGCL and (ii) the
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under DGCL. Sicor shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Teva, (x) make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, (y)
offer to settle or settle any such demands or (z) waive any failure to
deliver a written demand for appraisal or other action required to perfect
appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Sicor changes the
number of shares of Sicor Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Sicor Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Teva Ordinary Shares shall
be changed into a different number of shares by reason of stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, split-up, combination or the like, the
Conversion Number shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

3.5 _Affiliates_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Teva Stock Consideration shall be delivered to any Person who is
an Affiliate of Sicor under Rule 145 of the Securities Act until such Person
has executed and delivered to Teva a written agreement substantially in the
form of _Exhibit A_  hereto.

  



  

3.6 _Biomedical Frontiers Warrants_.

  



  

(a) At or following the Effective Time, Biomedical Frontiers Incorporated,
its successor or assigns, shall have the right to purchase and receive upon
the basis and upon the

  



  

7      
   



  

terms and conditions specified in the Milestone 1 Warrant Agreement, dated as
of July 1, 2003, between Sicor and Biomedical Frontiers Incorporated,
including payment of the exercise price, and in lieu of each share of Sicor
Common Stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the
exercise of the Milestone 1 Warrants (as defined in the License, Development
and Marketing Agreement, dated as of September 17, 2001, by and between
Biomedical Frontiers Incorporated and Sicor (the " _License Agreement_ ")),
the Merger Consideration, without interest.

  



  

(b) In addition, Sicor or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
issue the Milestone 4 Warrants (as defined in the License Agreement) when and
as required pursuant to the License Agreement, and such Milestone 4 Warrants
shall contain such terms and conditions, including payment of the exercise
price, pursuant to the License Agreement; provided, that the holder of such
Milestone 4 Warrants shall have the right to purchase and receive upon the
basis and upon the terms and conditions to be specified in the Milestone 4
Warrant Agreement, in lieu of each share of Sicor Common Stock theretofore
purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the Milestone 4 Warrants, the
Merger Consideration, without interest.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _THE CLOSING_

  



  

4.1 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(i) at the offices of Pillsbury Winthrop LLP, One Battery Park Plaza, New
York, New York 10004 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the Business Day after
the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
shall be satisfied or waived (by the party entitled to the benefit of such
condition) in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and
time and/or on such other date as Sicor and Teva may agree in writing (the "
_Closing Date_ ").  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_
" means a day on which banks are not required or authorized by Law to close
in Tel Aviv or New York City.

  



  

ARTICLE V

  



  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

  



  

5.1 _Representations and Warranties of Sicor_. Sicor hereby represents and
warrants to Teva and Merger Sub that:

  



  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_.  Each of Sicor and its
Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
currently conducted in all material respects and is qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
the ownership or operation of its properties and assets or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so

  



  

8      
   



  

qualified as a foreign corporation or be in good standing would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect. Sicor has heretofore made available to Teva complete
and correct copies of Sicors and each of its Significant Subsidiaries
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable
governing instruments), as amended through the date hereof. The certificate
of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable governing instruments) of each of
Sicor and its Significant Subsidiaries so made available are in full force
and effect.  Section 5.1(a) of the disclosure schedules delivered to Teva
by Sicor on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Sicor
Disclosure Schedules_ ") sets forth a list, as of the date hereof, of all of
the Significant Subsidiaries of Sicor, the jurisdictions under which
such Significant Subsidiaries are incorporated, and the percent of the
equity interest therein owned by Sicor and each Subsidiary of Sicor,
as applicable. Sicor does not have any Subsidiary that is organized in
Israel.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to
Sicor, Teva or Merger Sub, as the case may be, any entity,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other Persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party
or by one or more of its respective Subsidiaries or by such party and any one
or more of its respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Significant Subsidiary_ " means a
"significant subsidiary" within the meaning of Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X
promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("
_Exchange Act_ ").

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Sicor Material Adverse Effect_ " means
a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets
or results of operations of Sicor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
_provided, however_ , that any such effect resulting from or arising out of
(i) any change in Law or United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") or interpretations thereof, (ii) economic or
business conditions in the United States generally, (iii) conditions
generally affecting the pharmaceutical industry or (iv) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not be considered when determining if a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _knowledge_ " or any
similar formulation of knowledge shall mean the knowledge, after due inquiry,
of, with respect to Sicor, those persons set forth in Section 5.1(a) of
Sicor Disclosure Schedules and, with respect to Teva, those persons set forth
in Section 5.2(a) of the disclosure schedules delivered to Sicor by Teva
on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Teva Disclosure Schedules_
").

  



  

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of Sicor consists of
(i) 250,000,000 shares of Sicor Common Stock, of which 119,050,306 shares
were outstanding as of October 27, 2003 and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Sicor Preferred Stock_ "),
of which 125,000 shares are designated Series I Participating Preferred Stock
(the " _Series I Preferred Stock_ "), none of which were outstanding as of
the date hereof.  Pursuant to Sicors Stockholder Rights Plan, dated March
16, 1992, as amended (the " _Stockholder Rights Plan_ "), each share of Sicor
Common Stock has attached thereto a right

  



  

9      
   



  

(each a " _Right_ " and collectively, the " _Rights_ ") to purchase one one-
thousandth of a share of Series I Preferred Stock at a price of $200.00 per
one one-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Sicor Common Stock have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or other securities of each of Sicors Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is owned by
Sicor or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sicor, free and
clear of any lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance.
Except as set forth on Section 5.1(b) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules and
other than pursuant to (i) Sicors 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended,

reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Sicor to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Except as set forth on Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Sicor Disclosure
Schedules, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation by Sicor of the transactions contemplated hereby (including

the assets of Sicor or any Subsidiary of Sicor (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) pursuant to, any agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation not otherwise terminable by the
other party thereto on ninety (90) days or less notice (" _Contracts_ ")
binding upon Sicor or any Subsidiary of Sicor or any Law or governmental or

to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Sicor Reports; Financial Statements_. The filings required to be made
by Sicor since December 31, 2000 under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act have been filed with the

  



  

11      
   



  

Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), including all forms,
registration, proxy and information statements, reports, agreements (oral or
written) and all documents, exhibits, amendments and supplements appertaining
thereto, and complied, as of their respective dates, in all material respects
with all applicable requirements of the appropriate statutes and the rules
and regulations thereunder (collectively, including any amendments of any
such reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by Sicor prior to the date
hereof, the " _Sicor Reports_ "). Sicor has made available to Teva (i) each
Sicor Report filed with or furnished to the SEC by Sicor pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act since December 31, 2000 and prior to the
date hereof, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments
thereto) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and (ii) each of Sicors press releases released to the
public in 2003 which are located at http://investor.sicor.com/releases.cfm.
 None of the Sicor Reports (in the case of Sicor Reports filed pursuant to
the Securities Act), as of their effective dates, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein not misleading. None of the Sicor Reports (in the case of Sicor
Reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act) as of the respective dates filed
with the SEC or first mailed to stockholders, as applicable, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Sicor
Reports (in the case of Sicor Reports issued to the public as press releases)
as of their respective release dates, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(e) of the
Sicor Disclosure Schedules, the consolidated financial statements of Sicor
and its Subsidiaries included in such Sicor Reports comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into Sicor Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Sicor and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into Sicor Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case
may be, of Sicor and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. Any change by Sicor in the accounting principles, practices or
methods used in such financial statements of Sicor and its Subsidiaries
included in the Sicor Reports has been appropriately disclosed in such
financial statements. Sicors disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable
Sicor to comply with, and the appropriate officers of Sicor to make all
certifications required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ").

  



  

(f) _Disclosure Documents_.

  



  

(i) The proxy statement of Sicor (which will also constitute the prospectus
of Teva) to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "
_Proxy_

  



  

12      
   



  

 _Statement/Prospectus_ ") and any amendments or supplements thereto will,
when filed, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act. At the time the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed
to stockholders of Sicor, and at the time such stockholders vote on adoption
of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as supplemented or
amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in
this Section 5.1(f) will not apply to statements or omissions included in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus based upon information furnished to Sicor
in writing by or on behalf of Teva specifically for use therein.

  



  

(ii) None of the information provided by Sicor for inclusion in the
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time
the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto becomes
effective, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(g) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_.  Except as set forth on Schedule
5.1(g) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules, there are no liabilities or
obligations of Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever in
existence on the date hereof, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
determined, determinable or otherwise, other than: (i) liabilities or
obligations disclosed and provided for in the Sicor balance sheet as of June
30, 2003 included in the Sicor Reports or in the notes thereto (the " _Sicor
Balance Sheet_ ") or in the Sicor Reports filed prior to the date hereof;
(ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices since June 30, 2003; (iii) liabilities and
obligations not required to be disclosed on the Sicor Balance Sheet under
U.S. GAAP; and  (iv) liabilities or obligations that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sicor Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as described in the Sicor Reports
or as set forth on Schedule 5.1(h) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules, since
December 31, 2002 (the " _Audit Date_ "), except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, Sicor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole have conducted
their business only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction
other than according to, Sicors ordinary and usual course of such business
and there has not been (i) any change in the financial condition, properties,
assets, business or results of operations of Sicor and its Subsidiaries that
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse
Effect; (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution in respect of the capital stock of Sicor or
any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by Sicor or any Subsidiary of
any securities of Sicor or (iii) any change by Sicor in accounting
principles, practices or methods which is not required or permitted by U.S.
GAAP. Since the Audit Date and through the date hereof, except as provided
for herein, there has not been any material increase in the compensation
payable or that could become payable by Sicor or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries to officers or key employees or any material amendment of

  



  

13      
   



  

any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans other than increases or amendments
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.  Except as
disclosed in the Sicor Reports, since January 1, 2003, there have not been
any changes, circumstances or events which, individually or in the aggregate,
have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Sicor Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(i) _Litigation_. Except as described in the Sicor Reports or as set forth on
Schedule 5.1(i) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules, there are no civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations,
reviews or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Sicor, threatened
against Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect.  There are no material SEC inquiries or
investigations, other material governmental inquiries or investigations or
material internal investigations pending, or to the knowledge of Sicor,
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of Sicor or any
of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer
of Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(j) _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(i) The term " _Compensation and Benefit Plan_ " shall mean any bonus,
deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings,
employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, change in control,
retention, restricted stock, stock option, employment, termination,
severance, compensation, medical, health or other compensation or benefit
plan, including, without limitation, each "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), that covers employees or former employees ("
_Employees_ "), or directors or former directors of a party, or to which
contributions are made or otherwise required to be made; and any trust
agreement or insurance contract forming a part of such Compensation and
Benefit Plan.  Section 5.1(j) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules lists
all Compensation and Benefit Plans of Sicor and its Subsidiaries ("
_Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "), and any Sicor Compensation and
Benefit Plans containing "change of control" or similar provisions therein
are specifically identified in Section 5.1(j) of the Sicor
Disclosure Schedules. Sicor has made available to Teva prior to the date
hereof a copy of all Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plans and a copy of each
agreement, policy, practice or arrangement that covers key employees or
former key employees of Sicor and its Significant Subsidiaries.

  



  

(ii) All Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plans, to the extent subject to ERISA
and the Code, are in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Law. Each Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan"_ ) and that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_
"), and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would
cause the loss of such qualification or that would result in costs to Sicor
or any of its Subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Services Employee
Plans

  



  

14      
   



  

Compliance Resolution System.  There is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Sicor, threatened litigation or other proceeding relating to the Sicor
Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Pension Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof,
would subject Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

  



  

(iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any
of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with Sicor under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ").  Sicor and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to
a multi-employer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
thirty (30) day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other
than an extension pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Sicor Pension
Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the twelve (12) month period ending on
the date hereof.

  



  

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Sicor
Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United States law have been timely
made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet
filed or incorporated by reference in Sicor Reports. Neither any Pension Plan
nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding
funding waiver. Neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Pension Plan subject to United States
law or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

  



  

(v) Neither Sicor nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for, or
liabilities with respect to, retiree health and life benefits under any Sicor
Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United States law, except for
benefits required to be provided under Section 4980B of the Code or any other
applicable law requiring continuation of health coverage.

  



  

(vi) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including pursuant to
the Stockholders Agreement) will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Sicor
Compensation and Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether
of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee

  



  

15      
   



  

of Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries.  There is no contract, agreement, plan
or arrangement with an employee or former employee of Sicor or any of its
Subsidiaries to which Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date of this Agreement that, individually or collectively and as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement), whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events, or otherwise, would reasonably be likely to give rise to
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections
280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  



  

(vii) With respect to each Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plan not subject to
United States law (a " _Sicor Foreign Benefit Plan_ "): (i) each Sicor
Foreign Benefit Plan is in compliance with applicable Law; (ii) each Sicor
Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered with a regulatory agency or
authority has been registered and has been maintained in good standing
with such agency or authority, and (iii) as of the Effective Time, the fair
market value of the assets of each Sicor Foreign Benefit Plan is sufficient
to provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all current
and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions
and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Sicor Foreign Benefit Plan.

  



  

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.1(j), the representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.1(j)
shall be deemed to be true and correct unless such failures to be true and
correct are reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(k) _Compliance with Laws_. The business of Sicor and its Subsidiaries
is not being conducted in violation of any United States or foreign,
federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or
permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "), including
United States Food and Drug Administration (" _FDA_ ") and other Governmental
Entity rules, regulations and policies relating to good clinical practices,
good manufacturing practices, good laboratory practices, advertising and
promotion, pre- and post-marketing adverse drug experience and adverse drug
reaction reporting, and all other pre- and post-marketing reporting
requirements, as applicable, except for violations that would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of Sicor
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Sicor is not
debarred under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 and does not employ
or use the services of any individual who is debarred or, to the best of
Sicors knowledge, has engaged in any activity that could lead to debarment.
Except as set forth on Section 5.1(k) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Sicor or
any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Sicor, threatened,
nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing an intention to conduct
the same, except for those the outcome of which would not be reasonably
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Sicor Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of Sicor to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Sicor and each
of its Subsidiaries has, or has applied for, all permits, licenses,
franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other

  



  

16      
   



  

governmental authorizations, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities necessary to conduct its business as currently conducted, except for
those the absence of which would not be reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Sicor Material Adverse Effect or prevent
or materially impair the ability of Sicor to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5(k) shall not
apply to Environmental Laws which are covered exclusively in Section 5.1(m).

  



  

(l) _Anti-takeover Statutes and Rights Agreement_.

  



  

(i) Sicor has taken all action necessary to exempt the Merger, this
Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL.  No other
state anti-takeover statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement,
the Stockholders Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

  



  

(ii) Sicor has taken all action necessary to render the Stockholder Rights
Plan inapplicable to the Merger, the Stockholders Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

(m) _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(m) of the
Sicor Disclosure Schedules and except for such matters that would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to cause a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect: (i) the operations of Sicor and its Subsidiaries are
and have been in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) each
of Sicor and its Subsidiaries possesses and maintains in effect all
environmental permits, licenses, authorizations and approvals required under
applicable Environmental Laws with respect to the properties and business of
Sicor and its Subsidiaries; (iii) neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries
have received any written environmental claim, notice or request for
information concerning any violation or alleged violation of any applicable
Environmental Law, nor, to Sicors knowledge, is there any existing factual
or legal basis for any such claim, notice or request for information; (iv)
neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of a release or
threat of release of any Hazardous Substances which could reasonably be
expected to result in liability to Sicor or any of it Subsidiaries at any of
its or any of its Subsidiaries current or former properties or at any other
property arising from its or any of its Subsidiaries current or former
operations; (v) there are no writs, injunctions, decrees, orders or judgments
outstanding, or any actions, suits or proceedings pending relating to
compliance by Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries with any environmental
permits, licenses, authorizations and approvals required under applicable
Environmental Laws or liability of Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries under any
applicable Environmental Law; and (vi) no Lien has been placed upon any of
Sicors or the Subsidiaries properties (whether owned, leased or managed)
under any Environmental Law.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary (including, but not limited to, Section 5.1(k)), the representations
and warranties of Sicor in this Section 5.1(m) constitute the
sole representations and warranties of Sicor with respect to any
Environmental Law or Hazardous Substance.

(o) _Labor Matters_. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(o) of the Sicor
Disclosure Schedules, neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries is the
subject of any material proceeding asserting that Sicor or any of its
Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or any other violation of
law relating to employee matters, nor since January 1, 2003 has there been
any labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout
involving Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that, either
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(p) _Intellectual Property_. Except as described in the Sicor Reports or on
Section 5.1(p) of the Sicor Disclosure Schedules,

  



  

(i) Sicor or one of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or otherwise
possesses sufficient legally enforceable rights to use, all patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, technology, know-how,
computer software programs or applications, databases and tangible or
intangible proprietary information or materials that are currently used in
its and its Subsidiaries businesses (collectively, " _Sicor Intellectual
Property Rights_ "), except for any such failures to own, be licensed or
possess that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(ii) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect, (A) the use of
Sicor Intellectual Property Rights by Sicor or its Subsidiaries does not
conflict with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an
appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without
limitation, any valid patent, trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright
or other valid intellectual property right of any other Person and (B) there
have been no claims made and neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of any claim or otherwise knows that any Sicor
Intellectual Property Right is invalid, or conflicts with the asserted right
of any other Person.

  



  

(q) _Title to Properties_. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(q) of the
Sicor Disclosure Schedules, Sicor and each of its Subsidiaries has good and
valid title to all of its material properties and assets, free and clear of
all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges, security interests, encumbrances or
other adverse claims of any kind in respect of such property or asset
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), except Liens for taxes not yet due and payable
and such Liens or other imperfections of title, if any, that, individually or
in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse
Effect. All leases pursuant to which Sicor and each of its Subsidiaries
leases from others material real or personal property are valid and effective
in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of
such leases, any existing default or event of default of Sicor or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Sicor, any other party (or any event
which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material
default), that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to
have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(r) _Contracts_. Neither Sicor nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached, or
received in writing any claim or notice that it has breached, any of the
terms and conditions of any Contract

  



  

20      
   



  

to which it is a party or by which it is bound in such a manner as,
individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect. Each Contract to which Sicor or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound that has not expired
or terminated by its terms is in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, is
not reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(s) _Product Liability_. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(s) of the Sicor
Disclosure Schedules, no product liability claims have been asserted in
writing against Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
Sicor, threatened against Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any or
their products or product candidates developed, tested, manufactured,
marketed, distributed or sold by Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
claims that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect. There is no judgment, order or
decree outstanding against Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
product liability claims or assessments.

  



  

(t) _Insurance_. Sicor maintains for itself and its Subsidiaries insurance
policies covering the assets, business, equipment, properties, operations,
employees, directors and officers, and product warranty and liability claims,
and such other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles and
against such risks and losses as, in its judgment, are reasonable for the
business and assets of Sicor and its Subsidiaries. All such insurance policies
are in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been
paid, and Sicor and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with the
terms and conditions of such policies and bonds except for failures to so
comply that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(u) _Vote Required_. The approval of the majority of the shares of Sicor
Common Stock outstanding on the record date for such vote (the " _Sicor
Requisite Vote_ ") is the only vote of any class or series of the capital
stock of Sicor required to approve this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

(v) _Suppliers_. Sicor and its Subsidiaries has good commercial relationships
with each of its suppliers of active ingredients, bulk chemical products and
finished drug products and, to the best of its knowledge, there are no facts
concerning such suppliers that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material interruption in the timely supply by such suppliers to Sicor and its
Subsidiaries of any such materials, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect.
No such supplier has notified Sicor or its Subsidiaries in writing that it
intends to terminate or materially alter the terms of its supply relationship
with Sicor and its Subsidiaries, except as, individually or in the aggregate
with all other such notifications, is not reasonably likely to have a Sicor
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(w) _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except as disclosed on Section 5.1(w) of
the Sicor Disclosure Schedules or in the Sicor Reports, no present or former
affiliate of Sicor has, or since December 31, 2001 has had, (i) any interest
in any property (whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or
intangible) used in or pertaining to any of the businesses of Sicor or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) has had business dealings or a material financial
interest in any transaction

  



  

21

received in the ordinary course of business as an employee or director of
Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries) or (iii) any material equity interest or
any other material financial or profit interest in any Person that has had
business dealings or a material financial interest in any transaction with
Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(x) _Brokers and Finders_. Except for Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc. (" _Bear
Stearns_ "), neither Sicor nor any of its officers, directors or employees
has retained any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage
fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

  



  

(y) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Sicor has received an opinion of Bear
Stearns, dated as of the date hereof, to the effect that, as of such date,
the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to holders of
shares of Sicor Common Stock.

  



  

(z) _No Other Representations or Warranties_.  Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.1, neither Sicor
nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.2 _Representations and Warranties of Teva a_ _nd Merger Sub_.  Teva and
Merger Sub each represents and warrants to Sicor that:

Each of Teva and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power to own and
operate its material properties and assets and to carry on its business as
currently conducted in all material respects and is qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
the ownership or operation of its properties and assets or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified as a foreign corporation or be in good standing would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Teva
Material Adverse Effect. Teva has made available to Sicor a complete and
correct copy of the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of
Teva and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, each
as amended through the date hereof and as in full force and effect on the
date hereof.

  



  

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Teva Material Adverse Effect_ " means
a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets
or results of operations of Teva and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
_provided, however_ , that any such effect resulting from or arising out of
(i) any change in Law or U.S. GAAP or interpretations thereof, (ii) economic
or business conditions in the United States generally, (iii) conditions
generally affecting the pharmaceutical industry or (iv) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, or the contemplated consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall not be considered when determining if
a Teva Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

  



  

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized share capital of Teva consists of
999,575,693 ordinary shares, 424,247 class "A" ordinary shares and 60
deferred shares, of which 277,108,725

  



  

22      
   



  

Teva Ordinary Shares, including 199,231,374 Teva Ordinary Shares represented
by 199,231,374 outstanding Teva ADSs, were outstanding as of the close of
business on October 29, 2003. One Teva ADS represents one Teva Ordinary

be issued pursuant to the Merger have been duly authorized and will be, when
issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive or similar
right. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock, ownership interests,
or other securities of each of the Tevas Significant Subsidiaries
(including without limitation the shares of capital stock of Merger Sub) is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is owned by
Teva or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Teva, free and clear
of any lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance. Except
pursuant to Tevas stock plans (collectively, the " _Teva Stock Plans_ "), as

otherwise set forth on Section 5.2(b) of the Teva Disclosure Schedules, there
are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion

Significant Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to

authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, subject only to receipt of the Teva
Required Statutory Approvals. This Agreement has been duly executed and

securities and "blue sky" laws, (C) required to be made with the Israeli
Securities Authority ("ISA"), (D) required to be made with the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange Ltd. ("TASE"), (E) required to be made with Nasdaq and (F) the

23      
   



  

"Teva Required Statutory Approvals"), no notices, reports, registrations or
other filings are required to be made by Teva or Merger Sub with, nor are any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be
obtained by Teva or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity, in connection
with the execution and delivery by Teva and Merger Sub of this Agreement and
the consummation by Teva and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except for those that the failure to make
or obtain would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Teva Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Teva or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Teva and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Teva and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result
in (A) breach or violation of, or a default under, either the Memorandum of
Association or Articles of Association of Teva or the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Merger Sub or similar governing documents of any
of Tevas Significant Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a
default under, the acceleration of any obligations, the loss of any right or
benefit or the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other
encumbrance on the assets of Teva, Merger Sub or any of Tevas Subsidiaries
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to any Contracts
binding upon Teva, Merger Sub or any of Tevas Significant Subsidiaries or
any Law or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Teva,
Merger Sub or any of Tevas Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the
rights or obligations of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the
case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation, default,
acceleration, creation or change that would not be reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Teva Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Teva or Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e) _Teva Reports; Financial Statements_. The filings required to be made by
Teva and, to the extent applicable, its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2000
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act have been filed with the SEC,
including all forms, statements, reports, agreements (oral or written) and
all documents, exhibits, amendments and supplements appertaining thereto, and
complied, as of their respective dates, in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the appropriate statutes and the rules and
regulations thereunder (collectively, including any amendments of any such
reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by Teva prior to the date hereof,
the " _Teva Reports_ "). Teva has made available to Sicor (i) each Teva
Report filed with or furnished to the SEC by Teva pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act since December 31, 2000, and prior to the date
hereof, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments
thereto) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be and (ii) each of Tevas press releases released to
the public in 2003 which are located
at http://www.Tevapharm.com/pr/2003/index.asp.  None of the Teva Reports (in
the case of Teva Reports filed pursuant to the Securities Act), as of their
effective dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements made therein not

  



  

24      
   



  

misleading. None of the Teva Reports (in the case of Teva Reports filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act) as of the respective dates first mailed to
stockholders, as applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.  None of the Teva Reports (in the case of Teva Reports
issued to the public as press releases) as of their respective release dates,
as applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The consolidated financial statements of the Teva and its Subsidiaries
included in such Teva Reports comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Teva Reports (including the related notes and schedules) presents fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Teva and its
Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
income and of consolidated statements of cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Teva Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case
may be, of the Teva and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. Any change by Teva in the accounting principles, practices or
methods used in such financial statements of Teva and its Subsidiaries
included in the Teva Reports has been appropriately disclosed in such
financial statements.  Tevas disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable
Teva to comply with, and the appropriate officers of Teva to make all
certifications required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Teva qualifies as a
"foreign private issuer" as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(f) _Disclosure Documents_.

  



  

(i) None of the information provided by Teva for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to stockholders of Sicor and at the time the stockholders vote on
adoption of this Agreement, will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements make therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

  



  

(ii) The Registration Statements of Teva to be filed with the SEC with
respect to the offering of Teva ADSs representing Teva Ordinary Shares in
connection with the Merger (the " _F-4 Registration Statement_ ") and the
Teva ADSs issuable upon exercise of the assumed Sicor Stock Options (such
Registration Statement and the F-4 Registration Statement, collectively, the
" _Registration Statements_ ") and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when filed, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act. At the time a Registration Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto becomes effective and at the Effective
Time, the Registration Statements, as amended or supplemented, will not
contain any untrue

  



  

25      
   



  

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(g) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_.  Except as set forth on Section
5.2(g) of the Teva Disclosure Schedules, there are no liabilities or
obligations of Teva or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever in
existence on the date hereof, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
determined, determinable or otherwise, **** other than: (i) liabilities or
obligations disclosed and provided for in the Teva balance sheet as of June
30, 2003 included in the Teva Reports or in the notes thereto (the " _Teva
Balance Sheet_ ") or in the Teva Reports to the date hereof; (ii) liabilities
or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices since June 30, 2003; (iii) liabilities and obligations not
required to be disclosed on the Teva Balance Sheet under U.S. GAAP and (iii)
liabilities or obligations that would not reasonably be expected have
individually or in the aggregate, a Teva Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as described in the Teva Reports or
as set forth on Schedule 5.2(h) of the Teva Disclosure Schedules, since the
Audit Date, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Teva and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole have conducted their business only in, and have
not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary
and usual course of such business and there has not been (i) any change in
the financial condition, properties, assets, business or results of
operations of Teva and its Subsidiaries that has had or would be reasonably
likely to have a Teva Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any declaration, setting
aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution in respect of the
capital stock of Teva or any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by
Teva or any Subsidiary of any securities of Teva other than regular quarterly
dividends on shares of Teva Common Stock in the ordinary course (including,
in the case of Teva Ordinary Shares, any periodic increase thereon consistent
with past practice) or (iii) any change by Teva in accounting principles,
practices or methods which is not required or permitted by U.S. GAAP.  Since
the Audit Date and through the date hereof, except as provided for herein,
there has not been any material increase in the compensation payable or that
could become payable by Teva or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
to officers or key employees or any material amendment of any of the
Compensation and Benefit Plans other than increases or amendments in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.  Except as
disclosed in the Teva Reports, since January 1, 2003, there have not been any
changes, circumstances or events which, individually or in the aggregate,
have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Teva Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(i) _Litigation_. Except as described in the Teva Reports or as set forth on
Schedule 5.2(i) of the Teva Disclosure Schedules, there are no civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations,
reviews or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Teva threatened
against Teva or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Teva
Material Adverse Effect. There are no material SEC inquiries or
investigations, other material governmental inquiries or investigations or
material internal investigations pending, or to the knowledge of Teva,
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of Teva or any of
its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of
Teva or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

26      
   



  

(j) _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(i) Teva has made available to Sicor prior to the date hereof a copy of all
Compensation and Benefit Plans of Teva and its Significant Subsidiaries other
than those that, in the aggregate, are not material to Teva and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the " _Teva Compensation and Benefit Plans_
"), and a copy of each material agreement, policy, practice or arrangement
that covers key employees of Teva and its Significant Subsidiaries as a
group.

  



  

(ii) All Teva Compensation and Benefit Plans, to the extent subject to the
ERISA and the Code are in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Law. Each Teva
Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and nothing
has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would cause the loss
of such qualification or that would result in costs to Teva or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Services Employee
Plans Compliance Resolution System. There is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of Teva, threatened litigation or other proceeding relating to Teva
Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither Teva nor any of its
Significant Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, would subject Teva or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
to a material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

  



  

(iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Teva or any of its Significant Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Teva and
its Significant Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any
withdrawal liability with respect to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle E
of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an
ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the thirty (30) day reporting requirement has
not been waived or extended, other than an extension pursuant to Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be
filed for any Teva Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the twelve
(12) month period ending on the date hereof.

  



  

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Teva
Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United States law have been timely
made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet
filed or incorporated by reference in Teva Reports. Neither any Teva Pension
Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding
funding waiver.  Neither Teva nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension

  



  

27      
   



  

Plan subject to United States law or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  



  

(v) Neither Teva nor its Significant Subsidiaries have any material
obligations for, or liabilities with respect to, retiree health and life
benefits under any Teva Compensation and Benefit Plan subject to United
States law, except for benefits required to be provided under Section 4980B
of the Code or any other applicable law requiring continuation of health
coverage.

  



  

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.2(j), the representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.2(j)
shall be deemed to be true and correct unless such failures to be true and
correct are reasonably likely to have a Teva Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(vii) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Teva Compensation and Benefit Plan that will or may result in
any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee
of Teva or any of its Significant Subsidiaries.

  



  

(viii) With respect to each Teva Compensation and Benefit Plan not subject to
United States law (a " _Teva Foreign Benefit Plan_ "): (i) each Teva Foreign
Benefit Plan is in material compliance with applicable Law; (ii) each Teva
Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered with a regulatory agency or
authority has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
such agency or authority, and (iii) as of the Effective Time, the fair market
value of the assets of each Teva Foreign Benefit Plan is sufficient to
provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all current
and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions
and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Teva Foreign Benefit Plan.

  



  

(k) _Compliance with Laws_. The business of Teva and its Subsidiaries is not
being conducted in violation of any Laws, including FDA and other
Governmental Entity rules, regulations and policies relating to good clinical
practices, good manufacturing practices, good laboratory
practices, advertising and promotion, pre- and post-marketing adverse drug
experience and adverse drug reaction reporting, and all other pre- and post-
marketing reporting requirements, as applicable, except for violations that
would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Teva Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the
ability of Teva to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Teva is not debarred under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of
1992 and does not employ or use the services of any individual who is
debarred or, to the best of Tevas knowledge, has engaged in any activity
that could lead to debarment.  No investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Teva or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of Teva, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in
writing an

  



  

28      
   



  

intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would
not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Teva Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of
Teva to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Teva and
each of its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses, franchises,
variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental authorizations, consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities necessary to conduct its business
as currently conducted, except for those the absence of which would not
be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Teva Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of
Teva to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 5.2(k) shall not apply to Environmental Laws which
are covered exclusively in Sections 5.2(l).

  



  

(l) _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth on Section 5.2(l) of the
Teva Disclosure Schedules and except for such matters that would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to cause a Teva
Material Adverse Effect: (i) the operations of Teva and its Subsidiaries are
and have been in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) each
of Teva and each of its Subsidiaries possesses and maintains in effect all
environmental permits, licenses, authorizations and approvals required under
applicable Environmental Laws with respect to the properties and business of
Teva and its Subsidiaries; (iii) neither Teva nor any of its Subsidiaries
have received any written environmental claim, notice or request for
information concerning any violation or alleged violation of any applicable
Environmental Law, nor, to Tevas knowledge, is there any existing factual or
legal basis for any such claim, notice or request for information; (iv)
neither Teva nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of a release or
threat of release of any Hazardous Substances which could reasonably be
expected to result in liability to Teva or any of it Subsidiaries at any of
its or its Subsidiaries current or former properties or at any other
property arising from its or any of its Subsidiaries current or former
operations; (v) there are no writs, injunctions, decrees, orders or judgments
outstanding, or any actions, suits or proceedings pending relating to
compliance by Teva or any of its Subsidiaries with any environmental permits,
licenses, authorizations and approvals required under applicable
Environmental Laws or liability of Teva or any of its Subsidiaries under any
applicable Environmental Law; and (vi) no Lien has been placed upon any of
Tevas or its Subsidiaries properties (whether owned, leased or managed)
under any Environmental Law.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary (including, but not limited to, Section 5.2(k)), the representations
and warranties of Teva in this Section 5.2(m) constitute the
sole representations and warranties of Teva with respect to any Environmental
Law or Hazardous Substance.

  



  

(m) _Tax Matters_. Teva and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have duly and
timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within which to file)
all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them as of the date
hereof and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all
material respects; (ii) (A) have timely paid all Taxes that are shown as due
on such filed Tax Returns, except with respect to matters contested in good
faith and (B) no material penalties or charges are due with respect to the
late filing of any Tax Return required to be filed by or with respect to any
of them on or before the Effective Time; (iii) with respect to all Tax
material Returns filed by or with respect to any of them have not waived any
statute of

  



  

29      
   



  

limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency; and (iv) as of the date hereof,
does not have any deficiency, or any such audits, examinations,
investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters
pending or proposed or threatened in writing.

  



  

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither Teva nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject
of any material proceeding asserting that Teva or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or any other violation of
law relating to employee matters, nor since January 1, 2003 has there been
any labor strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout
involving Teva or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that, either
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Teva
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(o) _Intellectual Property_. Except as described in the Teva Reports or on
Section 5.2(o) of the Teva Disclosure Schedules,

  



  

(i) Teva or one of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or otherwise
possesses sufficient legally enforceable rights to use, all patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, technology, know-how,
computer software programs or applications, databases and tangible or
intangible proprietary information or materials that are currently used in
its and its Subsidiaries businesses (collectively, " _Teva Intellectual
Property Rights_ "), except for any such failures to own, be licensed or
possess that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Teva Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(ii) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Teva Material Adverse Effect, (A) the use of Teva
Intellectual Property Rights by Teva or its Subsidiaries does not conflict
with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation
of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without limitation, any
intellectual property right, patent, trademark, trade name, service mark,
copyright of any other Person and (B) there have been no claims made and
neither Teva nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any
claim or otherwise knows that any Teva Intellectual Property Right is
invalid, or conflicts with the asserted right of any other Person.

  



  

(p) _Title to Properties_. Teva and each of its Subsidiaries has good and
valid title to all of its material properties and assets, free and clear of
all Liens, except Liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such Liens or
other imperfections of title, if any, that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a Teva Material Adverse Effect. All
leases pursuant to which Teva and each of its Subsidiaries leases from others
material real or personal property are valid and effective in accordance with
their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing default or event of default of Teva or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of Teva, any other party (or any event which with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default), that,
individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Teva
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

30      
   



  

(q) _Contracts_. Neither Teva nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached, or
received in writing any claim or notice that it has breached, any of the
terms and conditions of any Contract to which it is a party or by which it is
bound in such a manner as, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably
likely to have a Teva Material Adverse Effect. Each Contract to which Teva or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound that has not
expired or terminated by its terms is in full force and effect, except where
the failure to be in full force and effect is not reasonably likely to have a
Teva Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(r) _Product Liability_. No product liability claims have been asserted in
writing against Teva or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Teva,
threatened against Teva or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any or their
products or product candidates developed, tested, manufactured, marketed,
distributed or sold by Teva or any of its Subsidiaries, except for claims
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Teva Material Adverse Effect. There is no Order outstanding against Teva or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to product liability claims or assessments.

  



  

(s) _Insurance_. Teva maintains for itself and its Subsidiaries insurance
policies covering the assets, business, equipment, properties, operations,
employees, directors and officers, and product warranty and liability claims,
and such other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles and
against such risks and losses as, in its judgment, are reasonable for the
business and assets of Teva and its Subsidiaries. All such insurance policies
are in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been
paid, and Teva and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with the
terms and conditions of such policies and bonds except for failures to so
comply that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Teva Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(t) _No Business Activities_. Merger Sub is not a party to any material
agreement and has not conducted any activities other than in connection with
the organization of Merger Sub, the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Merger Sub has no Subsidiaries.

  



  

(u) _No Vote Required_. No approval of the stockholders of Teva is required
to approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote
or consent of Teva as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall
have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of
the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary
to approve this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(v) _Ownership of Sicor Common Stock_. Except pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement, neither Teva, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
or, to the knowledge of Teva, any of their respective affiliates or
associates (as such terms are defined under the Exchange Act) (i)
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or (ii) is a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in case of either clause (i) or
(ii), any shares of Sicor Common Stock.

  



  

(w) _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except as disclosed on Section 5.2(w) of
the Teva Disclosure Schedules or in the Teva Reports, no present or former
affiliate of Teva has, or since

personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible) used in or pertaining
to any of the businesses of Teva or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) has had
business dealings or a material financial interest in any transaction with
Teva or any of its Subsidiaries (other than compensation and benefits
received in the ordinary course of business as an employee or director of
Teva or any of its Subsidiaries) or (iii) any material equity interest or any
other material financial or profit interest in any Person that has had
business dealings or a material financial interest in any transaction with
Teva or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(x) _Brokers and Finders_. Except for Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and
Lehman Brothers Inc., the fees, commissions and expenses of which will be
paid by Teva, neither Teva, Merger Sub nor any of their respective officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

(y) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Teva has received opinions of Credit
Suisse First Boston LLC and Lehman Brothers Inc., dated as of the date
hereof, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be
paid to holders of Sicor Common Stock in the Merger is fair from a financial
point of view to Teva.

  



  

(z) _Financial Capability_. Teva has the financial capacity to perform and
to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and Teva
has currently available cash or cash equivalents that, together with
committed bank lines of credit, are sufficient to permit Teva to fund the
Cash Consideration set forth in Article III and any other amounts payable by
Teva or Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(aa) _No Other Representations or Warranties_.  Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.2, neither Teva
nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of Teva or any of its Subsidiaries.

Proposal, failing to make or withdrawing or modifying its recommendation or
declaration of advisability of the Merger or adoption of this Agreement, (F)
taking any non-appealable, final action ordered to be taken by Sicor by any
court of competent jurisdiction and/or (G) making any disclosure or filing,
in its reasonable judgment after receiving advice from outside counsel, that
is required by Law (including, without limitation, the DGCL and the rules and
regulations promulgated under the federal securities laws), stock exchange
rules or the rules, regulations, order or request of any Governmental Entity
(including the SEC), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses
(A) through (E) only if (i) the Sicor Requisite Vote has not been obtained,
(ii) if such third party has submitted a Superior Proposal which is pending
at the time Sicor determines to take such action or, in the cases of action
pursuant to clauses (A) and (B), the Board of Directors of Sicor shall have
concluded in good faith that such bona fide Acquisition Proposal would
reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal, and
(iii) the Sicor Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the discharge of the Sicor Board of Directors fiduciary
duties to the Sicor stockholders under Delaware Law; _provided, further_ ,
that the Board of Directors of Sicor shall not take any of the foregoing
actions referred to in clauses (D) and (E) above, until at least three (3)
calendar days shall have passed following Tevas receipt of written notice
from Sicor advising Teva that the Sicor Board of Directors has received such
a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and Teva does not make an
offer that the Sicor Board of Directors shall have concluded in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, is as favorable (taking into account the termination fee payable
hereunder) to Sicors stockholders as such Superior Proposal.

  



  

Sicor will promptly (and in any event within one business day) notify Teva in
writing, of the existence of any material proposal, material discussion,
material negotiation or material inquiry received by Sicor with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, and Sicor will immediately communicate to Teva the
material terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it
may receive and the identity of the Person making such proposal or inquiry or
engaging in such discussion or negotiation. Sicor will promptly provide to
Teva any non-public material information concerning Sicor provided to any
other Person that was not previously provided to Teva on the same day as the
providing of any such information to any other Person.  Sicor will keep Teva
reasonably informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including modifications or proposed modifications thereto).

  



  

Without prejudice to any actions permitted to be taken by Sicor pursuant to
the immediately preceding paragraph, Sicor agrees that it will, and will
cause its officers, directors and representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, Sicor shall promptly request that each
Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with such Persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of Sicor in accordance with such confidentiality agreement. Sicor
shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any such
confidentiality agreement or any other confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which Sicor is a party. Sicor agrees that it will take the

  



  

38      
   



  

necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken by Sicor in this
Section 7.2.

  



  

Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall (x) permit Sicor to terminate this
Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article IX hereof) or (y)
affect any other obligation of Sicor under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.2 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Sicor may, in connection with a
possible Acquisition Proposal, refer any third party to this Section 7.2 and
Section 9.5(b) and make a copy of this Section 7.2 and Section 9.5(b)
available to a third party.

  



  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal to acquire, directly or
indirectly, for consideration consisting solely of cash and/or marketable
securities, 30% or more of the Sicor Common Stock then outstanding or 40% or
more of the assets of Sicor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions, and otherwise
on terms which the Sicor Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor),
taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the third party making the proposal, (i) to
be more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger (after
considering the views of the Companys independent financial advisor with
respect to the value of the consideration provided for in such proposal as it
compares to the value of the consideration provided for in the Merger) and
(ii) which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Sicor Board of
Directors, is reasonably capable of being consummated without undue delay.

administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging any

contemplated hereby each of Teva, Merger Sub and Sicor shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and use all of their

  



  

40      
   



  

respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in paragraph (a)-(e) of this Section 7.4, if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
applicable Governmental Entity challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law (as defined below) or
which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the

either a Sicor Material Adverse Effect or a Teva Material Adverse Effect
(each defined, for purposes of this Section 7.4(f) to include prospects of
Teva and its Subsidiaries or Sicor and its Subsidiaries, as applicable).
Without excluding other possibilities, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed to be materially delayed if unresolved objections
or suits delay or could reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby beyond the period, including any
extension as therein provided, contemplated by Section 9.2(a) of this
Agreement. " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton

soon practicable after the date of such filing and to keep the F-4
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of Sicor in favor of approval and adoption of this

requests for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the F-4 Registration Statement shall be filed without
the approval of both parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Teva or
Sicor should discover any information relating to either party, or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the F-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that the documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Teva
and Sicor.

approved for quotation of the Nasdaq National Market System subject to
official notice of issuance.

  



  

7.8 _Affiliate Letters_. Sicor has delivered to Teva a letter identifying all
Persons who, in the judgment of Sicor, may be deemed, at the time this

such list as necessary to reflect any changes from the date thereof. Sicor
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written agreement

F-4 Registration Statement (the " _Resale Registration Statement_ ")
covering all shares of Affiliate Stock to be filed with the SEC **** as soon
as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective prior to or at the Effective Time.
Teva shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Resale

7.11 _Publicity_.  The initial press release shall be a joint press release
and thereafter Sicor and Teva each shall consult with the other prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by
the Stockholders Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect thereto, except as may be
required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or national market system.

  



  

7.12 _Benefits and Other Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Employee Benefits_. Teva agrees that, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary thereof, the current
and former employees of Sicor and its Subsidiaries who are receiving benefits
under the Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plans (" _Affected Employees_ ")
will continue to be provided with benefits under employee benefit plans that
are the same or substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (i) those
currently provided by Sicor and its Subsidiaries to such employees as of the
Closing Date or

  



  

43      
   



  

(ii) those provided by Teva and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated
employees from time to time during such two (2) year period. Following
the Effective Time, Teva shall cause service by Affected Employees of Sicor
and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) to be taken into account
for purposes of eligibility to participate, eligibility to commence
benefits, vesting and, solely for purposes of severance and vacation
benefits, benefit accruals (except to the extent such treatment would result
in duplicative accrual of benefits for the same period of service) under the
Compensation and Benefit Plans or any other benefit plans of Teva or its
Subsidiaries in which such employees participate.

  



  

From and after the Effective Time, Teva shall, with respect to
Affected Employees entitled to participate in Compensation and Benefit Plans
subject to United States law, (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition limitations under welfare benefit plans, policies or practices of
Teva or its Subsidiaries in which employees of Sicor or its Subsidiaries
participate and (ii) cause to be credited any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries and dependents
during the portion of the calendar year prior to participation in the benefit
plans provided by Teva and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Teva shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all employee
benefit obligations to current and former employees and directors under the
Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plans. Teva shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume in writing the obligations under the employment
agreements and change of control agreements to which Sicor is a party at the
Effective Time as required by such agreements.

  



  

Teva agrees that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement meet the
definition of, and shall constitute, a "change in control" under each
Sicor Compensation and Benefit Plan listed in Section 5.1(h)(i)(B) of
Sicor Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

(b) _Employees_. It is the present intention of Teva and Sicor that following
the Effective Time, there will be no significant involuntary reductions in
workforce at the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however_ , that if any significant reductions in workforce in respect of
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries become necessary,
they shall be made on a fair and equitable basis, in light of the
circumstances and the objectives to be achieved, to be determined by Teva in
its reasonable discretion. Any employee whose employment is terminated or job
is eliminated by Teva, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate on a fair and equitable basis
in the job opportunity and employment placement programs offered by Teva, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries at such
employees local level. Any workforce reductions carried out following the
Effective Time by Teva or the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries shall be done in all material respects in accordance with all
applicable collective bargaining agreements, and all Laws and regulations
governing the employment relationship and termination thereof

Notification Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable
state or local Law.

  



  

7.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers_ _ Insurance_.  (a) Teva

44      
   



  

limitation of clause (i), as required pursuant to the existing indemnity
agreements of Sicor (and Teva also shall advance attorneys fees and expenses
as incurred (x) to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (y)
without limitation of clause (x), as required pursuant to the existing
indemnity agreements of Sicor, provided, if and only to the extent required
by the DGCL and such existing indemnity agreements, the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification),
each present and former director, officer and employee of Sicor and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs
or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_
") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 7.13, upon receiving written notification of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Teva
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Teva of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except if, and only to the extent that,
such failure materially and irreversibly prejudices Teva. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) Teva shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, promptly after statements therefor
are received, and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) Teva will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to Teva and the Indemnified Party;
_provided, however_ , that (A) Teva shall be obligated pursuant to this
Section 7.13(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction, except to the extent there is, in the opinion of
counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of such
Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties, in
which case each Indemnified Party with a conflicting position on a
significant issue shall be entitled to retain separate counsel mutually
satisfactory to Teva and such Indemnified Party, (B) the Indemnified Parties
shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (C) Teva shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, Teva or Merger Sub shall have purchased
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for Sicors directors
and officers for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time which
provides runoff coverage on the same terms and conditions as that currently
provided by Sicor for its directors and officers (as disclosed to Teva prior
to the date hereof) but broadened to include entity securities coverage, in
an amount of $50 million; provided, that Teva or Merger Sub shall not be
required to pay an aggregate premium in excess of $6 million; and, provided,
further, that if Teva or Merger Sub have not purchased such limits of
insurance at such cost by the 30th day before the Effective Time, Sicor will
purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount.

  



  

45      
   



  

(d) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall include provisions for exculpation of director and officer liability
and indemnification on the same basis as set forth in Sicors certificate
of incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date hereof. For six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Teva shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect the provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation
providing for indemnification of Indemnified Parties, with respect to facts
and circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under the DGCL, which provisions shall not
be amended except as required by applicable Law or except to make changes
permitted by applicable Law that would increase the scope of the Indemnified
Parties indemnification rights thereunder.

  



  

(e) If Teva or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Teva or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Teva and the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 7.13.

  



  

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 7.13 shall be
in addition to any right such Person might have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under applicable Law (including the DGCL) or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Party with Sicor or any of its Subsidiaries.  The provisions of
this Section 7.13 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and
representatives.

  



  

7.14 _Expenses_.  Subject to Section 9.5(b) and (c), whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense, except that each of Sicor and Teva shall bear
and pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any
SEC filing fees).

  



  

7.15 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Stockholders Agreement, each of Teva, Sicor and Merger Sub and their
respective Board of Directors, shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions. " _Takeover Statute_ " shall mean
any restrictive provision of any applicable "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "interested stockholder" or other similar anti-
takeover Law, including Section 203 of the DGCL.

  



  

7.16 _Teva Vote_.  Teva shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to
be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any shares of Sicor
Common Stock and any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned

the same manner as specified above), except for failures to be true and
correct that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be likely
to have a Sicor Material Adverse Effect; provided, that for purposes
of determining whether the condition in this Section 8.2(a) is
satisfied, "Sicor Material Adverse Effect" and any other materiality
qualification contained in such representations and warranties shall be
ignored, and Teva shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Sicor

is satisfied, "Teva Material Adverse Effect" and any other
materiality qualification contained in such representations and warranties
shall be ignored, and Sicor shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Teva and Merger Sub by the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of each of Teva and Merger Sub to such effect.

 _TERMINATION_

  



  

9.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether

9.2 _Termination by Either Teva or Sicor_. This Agreement may be terminated
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by
action of the Board of Directors of either Teva or Sicor if

  



  

(a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by April 30, 2004, whether
such date is before or after the date of receipt of the Sicor Requisite Vote
(the " _Termination Date_ "), _provided_  that the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended for six (6) months if, on the

  



  

49      
   



  

Termination Date any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(b) or (c)
shall not have been satisfied or waived but (i) each of the other conditions
to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article VIII has been
satisfied or waived or remains capable of satisfaction, and (ii) any
approvals required by Section 8.1(b) or (c) that have not yet been obtained
are being pursued diligently and in good faith; _ provided_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (a) shall not be
available to any party that has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
caused the occurrence of the failure of the Merger to be consummated;

convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or

  



  

(c) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting

party has used all commercially reasonable efforts to have such Order
removed, repealed or overturned (whether before or after the receipt of the
Sicor Requisite Vote).

  



  

9.3 _Termination by Sicor_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned by action of the Board of Directors of Sicor at any time
prior to (a) receipt of the Sicor Requisite Vote, if the Board of Directors
of Sicor shall take any action contemplated by clause (D) or (E) of Section
7.2; _provided, however_ , that (i) Sicor complies with Section 7.2 and (ii)
the termination pursuant to this Section 9.3(a) shall not be effective unless
Sicor shall at or prior to the time of such termination make the payment
required by Section 9.5(b), or (b) the Effective Time, whether before or
after receipt of the Sicor Requisite Vote, if there has been a material
breach by Teva or Merger Sub of any material representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement such that the condition in
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), as the case may be, would not be satisfied
and that is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within twenty (20) days
after written notice of such breach is given by Sicor to the party committing
such breach.

  



  

9.4 _Termination by Teva_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned by action of the Board of Directors of Teva at any
time prior to the Effective Time if (a) the Board of Directors of Sicor takes
any action contemplated by clause (D) or (E) of Section 7.2, (b) the Board
of Directors of Sicor shall have withdrawn or materially and adversely
modified its adoption of this Agreement or its recommendation that the

that for all purposes of this Agreement, and without limitation, the fact
that Sicor, in compliance with this Agreement, has supplied any Person with
information regarding Sicor or has entered into discussions or negotiations
with such Person as permitted by this Agreement, or the disclosure of such
facts, shall not be deemed a withdrawal or modification of Sicors Board of
Directors recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement), (c) a tender
offer or exchange offer that, if successful, would result in any Person or
"group" becoming a "beneficial owner" (such terms having the meaning in this
Agreement as is ascribed under Regulation 13D under the Exchange Act) of
thirty percent (30%) or more of the outstanding shares of Sicor Common Stock
is commenced (other than by Teva or an affiliate of Teva) and the Board of
Directors of Sicor recommends that the stockholders of Sicor tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer, (d) for any reason Sicor fails to
call or hold the Sicor

  



  

50      
   



  

stockholders meeting contemplated under Section 7.3 within six months of the
date hereof (provided that if the F-4 Registration Statement shall not have
become effective for purposes of the Securities Act by the date that is
twenty (20) business days (counting, for purposes of this clause (d), days
that are not business days in Tel Aviv but are business days in New York)
prior to the date that is five months from the date hereof, then such date
shall be extended by such number of days equal to the date from the end
of such five-month period until the effective date of such F-4 Registration
Statement) _; provided_ , that Tevas right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (d) shall not be available to Teva if it has breached
in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner
that shall have proximately caused the occurrence of the failure of the Sicor
stockholders meeting to be called or held, or (e) there has been a material
breach by Sicor of any material representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement such that the condition in Section
8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b), as the case may be, would not be satisfied and that
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within twenty (20) days after
written notice of such breach is given by Teva to Sicor.

  



  

9.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article
IX, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 10.1) shall become
void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or
of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial
advisors or other representatives); _provided, however_ , that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages resulting from any breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by either party
pursuant to Section 9.2(b), provided that at the time of the meeting referred
to in Section 9.2(b) an Acquisition Proposal or other announcement of
any intention with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
(even if such Acquisition Proposal had been rejected or withdrawn), (B) by
Sicor pursuant to Section 9.3(a), or (C) by Teva pursuant to Section 9.4(a),
(b), (c) or (d), then, in each case of clauses (A) - (C), (X) Sicor shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of
such termination, pay Teva a fee in the amount of $5 million to reimburse it
for expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (which expenses need not be documented) and (Y) if,
within twelve (12) months after any such termination Sicor enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to or consummates a
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, then Sicor shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of
such entering into a definitive agreement or of such consummation, as
applicable, pay Teva a termination fee (as liquidated damages) of $120
million (which includes charges and expenses incurred by Teva or Merger Sub
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).
 Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to
an account previously designated in writing by Teva to Sicor.

  



  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreement contained in Section 9.5(b) is
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without this agreement Teva would not have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Sicor fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to Section 9.5(b), and in order to obtain such payment Teva
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Sicor for payment of all
or a portion of a termination fee, Sicor shall pay to Teva its costs and
expenses (including its reasonable

  



  

51      
   



  

attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest from the date such payment was due on the amounts owed at the prime
rate in effect from time to time and quoted in _The Wall Street Journal_
during such period. The payment of such termination fee pursuant to
this Section 9.5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Teva with respect
to the facts and circumstances giving rise to such payment obligation (or
facts and circumstances which would have given rise to such payment but for a
breach of this Agreement by Teva).

10.7 _Entire Agreement; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIO_ _NS_. This Agreement
(including any exhibits hereto), Sicor Disclosure Schedules, the
Teva Disclosure Schedules and the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement,
dated June 19, 2003, between Teva and Sicor, as amended (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement by and among
the parties hereto, and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.  EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER TEVA AND MERGER SUB NOR SICOR MAKES ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR
OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO
THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

  



  

10.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Other than with respect to the matters
set forth in Section 7.13 (Indemnification; Directors and
Officers Insurance), this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

54      
   



  

10.9 _Obligations of Teva and of Sicor_. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Teva to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Teva to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever
this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Sicor to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Sicor to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on
the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.

  



  

10.10 _Severability_.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

10.11 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions
hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit,
such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."

  



  

10.12 _Assignment_.  This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise;  _provided, however_ , that Teva may designate, by written
notice to Sicor, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a
constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, so long as such designation
would not reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining any Teva
Required Statutory Approval or Sicor Required Statutory Approval or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) significantly increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or
(iv) materially delay the consummation of the Merger. If the requirements of
the previous sentence are met and Teva wishes to designate another wholly-
owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu
of Merger Sub, then, all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed
references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation.

  



  

55      
   



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed, acknowledged and
delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of
the date first written above.
