as of September 16, 2019, by and among: H. Lundbeck A/S, a Danish
_aktieselskab_ (" _Parent_ "); Lundbeck LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Payor_ ");
Violet Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Payor (" _Purchaser_ "); and Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are defined in  _Exhibit A_.

RECITALS

 

(A) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Parent has
agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended
from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (regardless of
whether issued or outstanding, the " _Shares_ "), other than the Excluded
Shares, for (i) $18.00 per share, net to the seller in cash (the " _Closing
Amount_ "), without interest, plus (ii) one (1) contingent value right per
share (a " _CVR_ ") which shall represent the right to receive the Milestone
Payment (as such term is used in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement in the
form attached hereto as _Annex II_ to be entered into between Parent and a
rights agent mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the " _Rights
Agent_ "), with such revisions thereto, if any, requested by the Rights Agent
that are not, individually or in the aggregate, detrimental to any CVR holder
(the " _CVR Agreement_ ")), net to the seller in cash, without interest, at
the time provided for in the CVR Agreement (the Closing Amount plus one CVR,
collectively, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, and
as may be adjusted in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(h)_, being the "
_Offer Price_ "), and subject to any withholding of Taxes.

(B) As soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, whereby (i) each issued and outstanding Share as of
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without
interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes, and (ii) the Company shall
become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

 

(C) The board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interest of,
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) declared it advisable to enter into
this Agreement, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Offer and the Merger, (iv) resolved that the Merger shall be effected
under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and (v) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the preceding _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_ ,
the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), in each case, on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

  ##### Table of Contents

(E) Parent, Payor, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be
consummated as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer.

(F) As a condition and inducement to Parents and the Purchasers willingness
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger,
Parent has entered into a tender and support agreement, dated as of the date
hereof, with the directors, certain executive officers and certain other

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_, as promptly as

having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant
to _Sections 1.1(e)_ and _1.2(b)_ ), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause

Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares
to be cancelled pursuant to _Sections 2.5(a)(i)_ and _2.5(a)(ii)_ (such other
Shares, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")), at a price per Share equal
to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest, and subject
to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_.

 

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of
Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares

Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions.
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii)
waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;

 decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer,
(D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, Termination
Condition or the conditions set forth in _clause (e)_ or _(g)_ of _Annex I_ ,
(F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner

except as provided in _Sections 1.1(c)_ or  _1.1(d)_ or (H) provide any
"subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) within the meaning of
Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date)
of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8_.

 

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) from the Offer Commencement Date
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent date to which
the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties
respective termination rights under _Section_ __ _ 8_: (i) if, as of the
then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has
not been waived by Purchaser, Payor or Parent, to the extent waivable by
Purchaser, Payor or Parent, Parent, Payor and Purchaser may, in their sole
discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person),
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to
ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend
the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by applicable
securities law, rule or regulation, any interpretation or position of the SEC,
the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to
ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR
Act and any foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirement shall
have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the
request of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to
ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event under this Agreement
shall Parent, Payor or Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond
the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8_ and (y) the End Date (such earlier
occurrence, the " _Extension Deadline_ "); (2) be permitted to extend the
Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the
Company; or (3) be required to extend the Offer beyond the then-existing
Expiration Date for more than three (3) consecutive additional periods not to
exceed an aggregate of thirty (30) business days ( _provided_ that each such
period will be ten (10) business days unless the Company agrees otherwise),
if, as of the applicable Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions are
satisfied or have been waived other than the Minimum Condition and conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the
Offer. Subject to the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 8_, Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer, or permit the
Offer to expire, prior to the Extension Deadline without the prior written
consent of the Company.

(d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8_. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not
acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated
or withdrawn by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall immediately return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that
will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of
the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and
related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that
they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with
the SEC (x) to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The
Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information
concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including
any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent
and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral
comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those
comments (including oral comments).

 

(f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, Parent
shall cause to be provided to Payor, and Payor shall cause to be provided to
Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds necessary to purchase all
Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and
Parent shall cause Payor and Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of
their respective obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall,
and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective
Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.

(g) CVR Agreement. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall
duly authorize, execute and deliver, and shall ensure that the Rights Agent
duly authorizes, executes and delivers, the CVR Agreement.

(h) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(h)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(i) Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable
by Purchaser, Payor or Parent, waiver by Purchaser, Payor or Parent of each of
the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
(i) promptly (and in any event no later than the first business day after)
after the Expiration Date accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) promptly after the Offer Acceptance Time
pay for such Shares.

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date,
following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall (i) file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

Company Board Recommendation and include the notice and other information
required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9
and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, including by setting the
Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes of receiving the notice
required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 (x) to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the

of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and
lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each
case true, accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date,

such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the

   ##### Table of Contents

Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause Payor to, and Payor shall, deposit with
the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate
Closing Amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(i)_ and _Section_ __ _

business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, (A) a
form of letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.6(f)_, if applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agents message
in respect to Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or

if applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal
in the case of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such transfer or other Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. None of

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Parent, Payor, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any
liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this _Section_
__ _ 2.6(b)_ under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated
by  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it or Payor any
funds (with respect to the aggregate Closing Amounts to which holders of
Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_) which had been
made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal
Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal
Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, any holders of
the Shares and any shares of Class A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares or any shares of Class A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(e) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Payor and
Purchaser, and their Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause the Rights Agent, the Paying Agent or the Depository Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration payable to any
holder of the Shares or any holder of Company Options, Company RSUs, Company
PSUs, Class A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company Warrant or any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR
Agreement such amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct
and withhold with respect to Taxes; _provided, however_ , no deduction or
withholding shall be made from such amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the CVR Agreement pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code. Each such
payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such
amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Body. To

 



10

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement and the CVR Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares, holder of Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs,
Class A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company Warrant or other recipient
of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder,
claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate),
the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2_.

 

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically
cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be
entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to
be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct and
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands,
and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and
Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any
such demands, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.8 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised, whether or not vested and which has a per share exercise price
that is less than the Closing Amount (each, an " _In the Money Option_ "),
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive both (i) a cash
payment equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Closing Amount over (y)
the exercise price payable per Share under such In the Money Option,
multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares subject to such In the Money
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to vesting)
and (ii) one (1) CVR for each Share subject to such In the Money Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to vesting).

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option other than an In the Money
Option that is then outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested (each,
an " _Out of the Money Option_ "), shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment, if any, from Parent with respect to each
Share subject to the Out of the Money Option upon the Milestone Payment Date
occurring pursuant to the CVR Agreement (or such date after achievement of the
Milestone on the terms and conditions set forth in the CVR Agreement as may be
required to ensure that such cash payment constitutes a short-term deferral
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4)), equal to the amount
by which the Per Share Value Paid exceeds the exercise price payable per Share
under such Out of the Money Option. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment
shall be payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ with respect to the
Milestone being achieved after expiration of the CVR Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Out of the Money Options
with an exercise price payable per Share equal to or greater than $20.00 shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time without any consideration payable therefor.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company RSU, whether or not
vested, shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive

number of Shares subject to such Company RSU and (ii) one (1) CVR for each
Share subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company PSU, whether or not
vested, shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
(i) a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the Closing Amount and (B) the
number of Shares subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (determined at the maximum level of performance) and (ii) one
(1) CVR for each Share subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (determined at the maximum level of performance).

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the second payroll date after the Effective Time) and as soon as
practicable following the Milestone Payment Date, if any, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliate to, and the Surviving Corporation
or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall, pay the aggregate consideration
payable pursuant to  _Sections 2.8(a)(i)_ , _2.8(b)_ , _2.8(c)_ and _2.8(d)_
, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to In the
Money Options, Out of the Money Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs through,
to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations or its Affiliates
payroll to the holders of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that it
determines to be appropriate or necessary to effect the transactions
described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

 



12

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(g) To the extent a payment made pursuant to the timing otherwise set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code, such payment shall be made on the earliest subsequent date that
payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

 

2.9 Treatment of Convertible Preferred. In accordance with Section 7(b) of the
Certificate of Designation, each share of Class A-1 Convertible Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time shall, upon
the Offer Acceptance Time, be cancelled without any further action on the
part of the Company or the holders thereof, and in consideration for such
cancellation, each holder of shares of Class A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock
shall automatically receive, for each share of Company Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of such shares of Class A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock that
would have been issuable had such cancelled shares of Class A-1 Convertible
Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
the same Offer Price receivable by holders of Company Common Stock promptly
after the Offer Acceptance Time, subject to any withholding Taxes in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_. The Company shall take all actions
required to ensure compliance with its obligations under the Certificate of
Designation and to consummate the treatment of shares of Class A-1
Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_. Prior to taking any such actions, the Company
shall consult with Parent and provide Parent and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any related notices, filings
or other documents in connection therewith.

 

2.10 Treatment of Company Warrant. In accordance with Section 9(c) of the
Company Warrant, upon the Offer Acceptance Time, if the Company Warrant is
then outstanding and unexercised, Parent shall cause the Purchaser to assume
(i) the obligation under Section 9(c) of the Company Warrant to deliver to the
applicable holder of the Company Warrant the same Offer Price receivable by
holders of Company Common Stock, and (ii) the other obligations of the Company
Warrant. The Company shall take all actions required to ensure compliance with
its obligations under the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and, if

treatment of the Company Warrant, in accordance with the preceding sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_. Prior to taking any such actions, the Company
shall consult with Parent and provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any related notices, filings or other
documents in connection therewith.

the Merger to become effective in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2_ as
soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a meeting
of the Companys stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If,
at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is reasonably
determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action.

necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Board of
Directors (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof or other

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets

adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the

operation of the internal control over financial reporting utilized by any
Acquired Corporation, which is reasonably likely to adversely affect any

and shall cause the respective Representatives of the Acquired Corporations to

designated Representatives and assets and to all existing books, records,
documents and information relating to the Acquired Corporations, and promptly
provide Parent and Parents Representatives with all reasonably requested
information regarding the business of the Acquired Corporations and such
additional financial, operating and other data and information regarding the
Acquired Corporations, as Parent may reasonably request (provided, that in the

the same); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted at
Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate

meeting. Nothing herein shall require any of the Acquired Corporations to
disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its

with Parent and used reasonable best efforts to permit disclosure to the
extent permitted by such Contract). With respect to the information disclosed

provision contained in applicable Takeover Laws or the Companys
organizational documents; (iii) waive or release any Person from, forebear in
the enforcement of, or amend any confidentiality, standstill or similar
Contract or any standstill provisions of any other Contract, unless, solely
in the case of this _clause (iii)_ , the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, in which
event the Acquired Corporations may take the preceding actions described in
this _clause (iii)_ solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party
to make, on a confidential basis, to the Board of Directors, an Acquisition

contact such Person or group of Persons solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof solely to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer and
(ii) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Offer and that the failure to take such action
described in _clauses (ii)(x)_ and  _(ii)(y)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirements, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (an executed copy of

purposes within 24 hours of execution thereof), information (including non-

Acquisition Proposal (including any proposed term sheet, letter of intent,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect thereto) and a
summary of any material unwritten terms and conditions thereof (and indicate

(b) At any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 

(i) if any Acquired Corporation has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Board

the end of such five (5)-business day period, after giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent during such period, if any, after consultation with
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that
such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Offer and that the failure to
make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Superior
Offer or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any
"stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not be considered a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a

the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) the Company shall have given Parent
a determination notice at least five (5) business days prior to making any
such Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, if desired by Parent, during
such five (5)-business day period shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with respect to any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent
proposed by Parent; and (3) (A) the Company shall have specified in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event that
render such Company Adverse Change Recommendation necessary, (B) the Company
shall have given Parent the five (5)-business day period after such
determination notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal, and (C) no earlier than the end of such five
(5)-business day period, after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent
during such period, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure
to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would nonetheless be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall
also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances specified in
_clause (3)(A)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ and require a new

with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any
other filings, notifications or other consents are required to be made with,
or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with
the Transactions (which submission to the applicable Governmental Bodies in
Austria and Germany shall be made, absent confirmation from such Governmental
Bodies that no filing is required, no later than seven (7) business days after
the date hereof in order to commence the applicable review period no later
than seven (7) business days after the date hereof, in connection with the
Transactions).

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_ __
_ 6.2_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall (i) give the other
Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body
or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with
respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, (ii) keep the other
Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the other
Parties of, and wherever practicable give the other party reasonable advance
notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, any communication to or from
the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly
furnish to the other Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, with copies
of documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding

regulations under the HSR Act, that contain valuation information (which can
be redacted)), (v) subject to an appropriate

 confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult and cooperate
with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi)
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal
Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, give the other
party reasonable advance notice of, and permit authorized Representatives of
the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

 

6.3 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who continues to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or
any Affiliate thereof) during such one (1)-year period (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that
provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding equity or equity based compensation and any retention
or other special or non-recurring bonus or incentive award) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to such base salary and short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding equity or equity based compensation and
any retention or other special or non-recurring bonus or incentive award)
provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits
(other than equity or equity-based benefits, severance or termination pay,
individual employment agreements and any retention or other special or non-
recurring bonus or incentive awards) that in the aggregate are no less
favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired
Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit plans
(to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate
under the Companys health and welfare benefit plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit
plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates
any such health or welfare benefit plan, then, the Continuing Employees shall
be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporations (or an Affiliates)
corresponding health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage
under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility or
vesting under any benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation that
is an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), then

 



55

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Parent shall ensure that such benefit plan shall, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, credit
Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company
and its Affiliates or their respective predecessors to the same extent that
such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding benefit plan of the Company. In addition, Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation shall credit each Continuing Employee with paid time
off equal to the accrued paid time off such Continuing Employee had accrued
with the Company that was unused as of the Effective Time, and disclosed to
Parent. To the extent that service is relevant for benefit levels, including
paid time off accruals, following the Effective Time, Parent shall ensure that
any employee plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall, for
purposes of benefit levels, credit Continuing Employees for service prior to
the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such service was
recognized prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Following the Effective Time Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or
an Affiliate that provides health benefits in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than
any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan,
(ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by
the Continuing Employees and their eligible covered dependents under the
health plans in which they participated immediately prior to transitioning
into a plan of Parent or an Affiliate during the portion of the plan year
prior to such transition in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-
pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or an Affiliate and (iii) waive
any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that
would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible covered dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible covered dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Employee
Plan prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Parent acknowledges that, upon the occurrence of the Offer Acceptance
Time, a "Change in Control" (or "Change of Control" as the case may be) of
the Company shall have occurred for purposes of each of the Employee Plans in
which such definition appears.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ are solely for the benefit of
the Parties, and no provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ is intended to,
or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in
any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and
the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

(f) With respect to the Companys 2019 fiscal year, the Company may, prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time, pay annual bonuses with respect to such fiscal
year at the level determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Employee Plans. If the Closing has
not occurred prior to January 1, 2020, the Board of Directors shall be
permitted to establish annual bonus targets and metrics with respect to the
2020 fiscal year in the ordinary course pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Employee Plans and past practice.

(g) Parent shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each
Continuing Employee who experiences a termination of employment from Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates during the
Continuation Period with severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those that would have been provided to such Continuing
Employee by any Acquired Corporation under the applicable severance policies
that are Employee Plans had such termination occurred prior to the Effective
Time.

 

6.4 ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms
of the Company ESPP to provide that (a) no new offering period will be
commenced following the date hereof under the Company ESPP, (b) each purchase
right issued pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be fully exercised not later
than five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time and (c) the Company
ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and no
further rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP
thereafter.

 

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of
any Acquired Corporation and any indemnification or other similar agreements
of any Acquired Corporation set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.9(a)(xvi)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and Parent shall cause the Acquired Corporations to perform their
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will, indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any Acquired
Corporation or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Acquired
Corporation as a director or officer of another Person (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation
as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements. In the event of any such claim, action, suit
or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding
from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in
accordance with the

 



57

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements
of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ that any Indemnified Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any
such matter.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations or provide
substitute policies for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the
benefit of the Acquired Corporations, in either case, of not less than the
existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable in the aggregate
to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired
Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an
"A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation
be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of
the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Acquired Corporations
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ," which Maximum
Amount is set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance
required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for a
premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company may, at its election (and if the Company does not so
elect, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation as of or after
the Effective Time to), purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policy for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors
and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the
benefit of the Acquired Corporations, such tail to provide coverage in an
amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired
Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost
of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such tail policy in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(c) In the event that any Acquired Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Acquired Corporation,
as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of such Acquired Corporation assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

 



58

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ (i) shall survive
the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the
consummation of the Merger and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Indemnified Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and
representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ may not be
amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their
successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

 6.6 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with (and shall give reasonable consideration to
Parents comments and other advice in connection with), and the opportunity
to participate in, any litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
officers relating to the Transactions or this Agreement, and the right to
consult on any settlement with respect to such litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to or offered without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation and
shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof.

6.7 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, Parent and the Company shall use

Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices
(if any) required to be made and given by such Party pursuant to any Material
Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other
Transactions, (b) seek each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant
to any Material Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions to
the extent requested in writing by Parent and (c) seek to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by any third
Person against such Party.

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and thereafter Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press
release(s) or otherwise making any public statement (to the extent not
previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to
the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or public statement without the
other Partys written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party
may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
required disclosures in documents required to be filed by such Party under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act, any similar Legal Requirement or any listing
agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or

such statements substantially reiterate previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Company and Parent (or
individually, if

the other Party but subject to giving reasonable advance notice to the other
Party of the contents thereof and consulting with the other Party with
respect to the contents thereof, issue any such press release or make any such
public announcement or statement that, after consultation with outside legal
counsel by the disclosing party, is determined to be required by Legal
Requirement or any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national
securities exchange or trading market, including NASDAQ or the Copenhagen
Stock Exchange; and (c) a Party need not consult with the other Party
in connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or
filing to be issued or made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ or with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 

6.9 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are

to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the
Transactions.

otherwise, and (ii) upon payment of such amount(s) and receipt thereof by

or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions; _provided_ that none of the foregoing under this _Section_ __ _
8.3(d)_ shall relieve any Company Related Party from any liability for
willful breach of this Agreement or fraud.

_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in
the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and

reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the

Parties.

 

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. At any time prior to the Effective Time,

other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other with
any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule
or in any certificate or schedule or other document delivered by any Person

66

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement except that the
restrictions on contact and restrictions on disclosure (to the extent
disclosure must be made in documents required to be filed under the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act, any similar Legal Requirement or any listing
agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or
trading market, including NASDAQ or the Copenhagen Stock Exchange
in connection with the Transactions) in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
solely for purposes of consummating the Offer and the Merger. This Agreement
may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by facsimile or by
email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall be considered one and the same

signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if
(but only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States
District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any
appellate court therefrom (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii)
each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.
Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
in the Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific performance is
an integral part of

 



67

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a
Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _ provided_, __ _ further_, __ _
however_, that Parent, Payor or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of
their controlled Affiliates only if such assignment shall not impede or delay
the consummation of the Transactions or relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; except for: (a) if the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs, (i) the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Offer Price
or Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2_ following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time,
as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the
right of the holders of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs to

(b) Unless otherwise required by an applicable Legal Requirement, Parent,
Purchaser, and the Company agree that for all U.S. federal and applicable
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes: (i) amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement may be treated as deferred contingent purchase price and (ii)
if and to the extent such amounts are paid to any holder of Shares, Class A-1
Convertible Preferred Stock, Company Warrants or Convertible Senior Notes, a
portion of the purchase price may be treated as interest pursuant to Section
483 or Section 1274 of the Code. Unless otherwise required by an applicable
Legal Requirement, the Parties shall file all Tax Returns consistently with
this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ with respect to the Tax treatment of the Offer

9.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision

court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this

 _CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS_

 

Section 2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders (granted to
Initial Holders as a consequence of the Offer and the Merger pursuant to the
terms of the applicable Specified Instruments) to receive a one-time
contingent cash payment of the Milestone Payment pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted CVR Transfer.
Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposition
of CVRs, in whole or in part, in violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2
_shall be void _ab initio_ and of no effect.

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change
of Address_.

(a) The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent will keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
purpose of (i) identifying the Holders of CVRs and (ii) registering CVRs and
Permitted CVR Transfers thereof. The CVR Register will initially show one
position for Cede and Co. representing all the Shares held by DTC on behalf of
the street holders of the Shares tendered by such holders in the Offer or
held by such holders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Rights
Agent will have no responsibility whatsoever directly to the street name

be made under _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ below, the Rights Agent will accomplish
the payment to any former street name holders of Shares by sending one lump
payment to DTC. The Rights Agent will have no responsibilities whatsoever

holders.

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 2.2_, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by
the Holder thereof, the Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the
Holders personal representative duly authorized in writing, or the Holders
survivor (with written documentation evidencing such persons status as
the Holders survivor), and setting forth in reasonable detail the
circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice,
the Rights Agent will, subject to its reasonable determination that the
transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies
with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.2_), register the transfer of the CVRs in the
CVR Register. As a condition of such transfer, Parent and Rights Agent may
require a transferring Holder or its transferee to pay to the applicable
Governmental Body any transfer, stamp or other similar Tax or governmental
charge that is imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer.
The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under any
section of this Agreement that requires the payment by a Holder of a CVR of
applicable Taxes or charges unless and until the Rights Agent is
reasonably satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have been paid or that
such Taxes or charges are not applicable. All duly transferred CVRs registered
in the CVR Register will be the valid obligations of Parent and Payor and will
entitle the transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement
as those held immediately prior to the transfer by the transferor. No transfer
of a CVR will be valid until registered in the CVR Register in accordance with
this Agreement.

 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent will promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

Section 2.4 _Payment Procedures; Notices_.

 

(a) If the Milestone is attained on or prior to the Expiration Date, then on
or prior to the Milestone Payment Date (i) Parent shall deliver to the Rights
Agent (x) written notice indicating that the Milestone has been achieved (the
" _Milestone Notice_ ") and an Officers Certificate certifying the date of
such achievement and that the Holders are entitled to receive the Milestone
Payment, (y) any letter of instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent
and (ii) Payor shall deliver to the Rights Agent the payment required by
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_.

 

(b) The Rights Agent will promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt of the Milestone Notice as well as any letter of
instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent, send each Holder at its
registered address a copy of the Milestone Notice and pay the Milestone
Payment Amount to each of the Holders by check mailed to the address of each
Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of business on the
date of the Milestone Notice.

(c) Except to the extent any portion of the Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest and except as otherwise required pursuant to
applicable Legal Requirements, the parties hereto intend to treat the
Milestone Payment for all Tax purposes as additional consideration for the
equity instruments acquired under the Specified Instruments. Parent shall or
shall require the Surviving Corporation to report imputed interest on the CVRs
as required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(d) Parent or its Affiliate (including Payor) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Rights Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
Milestone Payment Amount or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom under applicable Tax law, as may reasonably be determined by Parent
or the Rights Agent. With respect to Holders who received CVRs in
consideration of Company Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs, any such
withholding may be made, or caused to be made, by Parent through the Surviving
Corporations or its Affiliates (including Payors) payroll system or any
successor payroll system. Prior to making any Tax withholdings or causing any
Tax withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, other than ordinary
course payroll withholding and reporting on the Milestone Payment Amount, if
applicable, Parent shall instruct the Rights Agent to solicit IRS Forms W-9 or
W-8, as applicable, or any other reasonably appropriate forms or information,
from Holders in order to avoid or reduce such withholding, and the Milestone
Payment may be reasonably delayed in order to gather such necessary Tax forms.
The Rights Agent shall promptly and timely remit, or cause to be
remitted, any amounts withheld in respect of Taxes to the appropriate
Governmental Body. To the extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld and
properly and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.
As required by applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall deliver (or shall
cause the Rights Agent to deliver) to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid an original IRS Form 1099 or other reasonably
acceptable evidence of such withholding.

 

(e) Any portion of the Milestone Payment Amount that remains undistributed to
a Holder six (6) months after the date of the delivery of the Milestone
Notice will be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent or Payor, upon demand,
and any Holder will thereafter look only to Parent and Payor for payment of
the Milestone Payment Amount, without interest, but such Holder will have
no greater rights against Parent and Payor than those accorded to general
unsecured creditors of Parent and Payor under applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(f) None of Parent, any of its Affiliates (including Payor) or the Rights
Agent will be liable to any person in respect of the Milestone Payment Amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If, despite Payors and/or

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the Rights Agents commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Milestone
Payment Amount to the applicable Holder, the Milestone Payment Amount has not
been paid prior to two (2) years after the Milestone Payment Date (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Milestone Payment Amount
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body),
the Milestone Payment Amount will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, become the property of Payor, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. In addition to and not
in limitation of any other indemnity obligation herein, Payor agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Rights Agent with respect to any liability,
penalty, cost or expense Rights Agent may incur or be subject to in connection
with transferring such property to Payor.

 

Section 2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest
in Parent or any of its Affiliates_.

 

(a) The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 

(b) The CVRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent,
any constituent corporation party to the Merger Agreement or any of their
respective Affiliates.

(c) Neither Parent and its directors and officers nor Payor and its managers
and officers will be deemed to have any fiduciary or similar duties or
obligations to any Holder by virtue of this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Ability to Abandon CVR_. A Holder may at any time, at such
Holders option, abandon all of such Holders remaining rights in a CVR by
transferring such CVR to Payor without consideration therefor. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates (including Payor)
from offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration from the
Holders, in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole discretion. Any
CVRs acquired by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including Payor) shall be
automatically deemed extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of
the definition of Acting Holders and _Article V_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3_
hereunder.

Rights Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional
misconduct;

 

(i) Parent agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in
connection with this Agreement as agreed upon in writing by the Rights Agent
and Parent on or prior to the date hereof and (ii) to reimburse the Rights
Agent for all Taxes and governmental charges, reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Rights Agent in the execution of this
Agreement (other than Taxes imposed on or measured by the Rights Agents net
income and franchise or similar Taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
Taxes)). The Rights Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement from Parent
for all reasonable, documented and necessary out-of-pocket expenses paid or
incurred by it in connection with the administration by the Rights Agent of
its duties hereunder; and

 

(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if
there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds
or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.

Parent specifying a date when such resignation will take effect, which notice

to pay the Milestone in accordance with the terms hereof). Following any
Transfer permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.3(c)_, any subsequent
