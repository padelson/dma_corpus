48     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this
"Agreement"), dated as of May 7, 2001, among Front Royal, Inc., a North
Carolina corporation (the "Company"), Argonaut Insurance Company, a
California corporation, Argonaut Midwest Insurance Company, an Illinois
corporation (together, "Parent"), and Argonaut Acquisition Corp., a North
Carolina corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Subsidiary").  W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company have
approved this Agreement and deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective shareholders to consummate the merger provided for herein,
in which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;  
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has:
(a) determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of
the shareholders of the Company; (b) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) resolved to recommend that the
Company\'s shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:  ARTICLE I. THE MERGER  Section 1.1 Merger. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the North Carolina Business Corporation Act ("NCBCA"), at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.2), Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into
the Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Company following
the Merger, the "Surviving Corporation"). At the Effective Time, the Merger
will have the other effects provided in the applicable provisions of the
NCBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
immunities and franchises of the Company and Merger Subsidiary will vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all the debts, liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary will become the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  Section
1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.3), the Company
and Merger Subsidiary will cause appropriate articles of merger (the
"Articles of Merger") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of North Carolina in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, NCBCA Section 55-11-05. The
Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time when the Articles
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
North Carolina or, subject to the NCBCA, such time as is agreed upon by the
parties and specified in the Articles of Merger (such effective time, the
"Effective Time.")  Section 1.3 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated and the Merger herein contemplated shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Section 7.1 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to effect the Merger as set
forth in Article VI, the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10:00 a.m.
on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions and obligations set forth in Article VI of this Agreement
(excluding any conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until
the Closing) at the offices of Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn and Berman
LLP, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10104, unless another
date, time and/or place is agreed to by the parties hereto (the "Closing
Date").  Section 1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. The articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation but shall, effective at the
Effective Time, be amended and restated in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Parent and the Company. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, in the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable
law.  Section 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The
directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s articles of incorporation and
bylaws or as otherwise provided by law. The officers of the Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are chosen and have qualified in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise
provided by law.  ARTICLE II. CONVERSION OF SHARES  Section 2.1 Conversion
of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders
of any shares of Company Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) or Company
Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined):  (a) Subject to Section 2.9 and
Article VIII, each share of Class A Common Stock ("Class A Common Stock"),
Class B Common Stock ("Class B Common Stock"), and Class C Common Stock
("Class C Common Stock"), each no par value, of the Company (collectively,
the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Company Stock to be canceled pursuant to
subsections (d) and (e) below and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.8)) shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive, payable upon surrender of the certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2,
$13.6938 per share in cash (the "Initial Common Stock Merger Consideration")
and the Additional Common Stock Merger Consideration (as defined in Section
2.9), if any (the Initial Common Stock Merger Consideration and the
Additional Common Stock Merger Consideration are referred to collectively as
the "Common Stock Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof
without interest, subject to adjustment as set forth below. All such Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate or certificates previously evidencing such shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with
Section 2.2. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) shall be made
net of applicable withholding taxes to the extent such withholding is
required by law.  (b) Subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII, each share of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company Preferred Stock to be
canceled pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) below and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, payable upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Preferred
Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2, the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration (as hereinafter defined), payable to the holder thereof without
interest. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration" shall mean the Initial Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
and the Additional Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (as defined in
Section 2.9) and (ii) "Initial Preferred Stock Merger Consideration" shall
mean an amount equal to 16-2/3 times the Initial Common Stock Merger
Consideration. All such Company Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates
previously evidencing such shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Preferred Stock upon the surrender of
such certificates in accordance with Section 2.2. Any payment made pursuant
to this Section 2.1(b) shall be made net of applicable withholding taxes to
the extent such withholding is required by law.  (c) Each share of common
stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which will
constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, each outstanding certificate theretofore
representing shares of common stock of Merger Subsidiary will be deemed for
all purposes to evidence ownership and to represent the same number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.  (d) Each share of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is held by the Company or any wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company as treasury stock shall be canceled and retired and
cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.  (e) Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
held of record by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (other than in each case, shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and the like that are
beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be canceled and cease to exist, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.  (f) As a result of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of such shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock,
except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be.  Section 2.2
Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares  (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall designate First Union National Bank
or such other paying agent mutually agreed to by the parties hereto (the
"Paying Agent") to act as paying agent for the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger, and
shall enter into an agreement providing for the matters set forth in this
Section 2.2, Section 2.9 and Section 8.3 and such other matters as may be
appropriate, the form and terms of which are reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, for the payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration and the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with or for the account of the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled pursuant to Sections
2.1(d) and (e)), an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Initial Common
Stock Merger Consideration and Initial Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Section 2.2, less the Holdback to be deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8.1 (such cash funds, the "Payment
Fund"). Any interest, dividends or other income earned from investment of the
Payment Fund shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation. At the
direction of Parent, the Paying Agent may invest the Payment Fund in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations receiving the highest investment grade rating from both
Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. and Standard and Poor\'s, a division of
McGraw Hill, Inc., or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$100,000,000 (collectively, "Permitted Investments"); provided, however, that
the maturities of Permitted Investments shall be such as to permit the Paying
Agent to make prompt payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger. Such funds held by the
Paying Agent shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided
in this Agreement.  (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event
no later than three business days following the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Subsidiary will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock (the "Certificates"), whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, respectively (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as the Company and Merger Subsidiary may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Company, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Common
Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, respectively,
formerly represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon (other
than pursuant to Article VIII), less any required withholding of taxes, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Initial
Common Stock Merger Consideration or Initial Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration (less the Holdback) will be delivered by the Paying Agent as
promptly as practicable following surrender of a Certificate and the related
transmittal documents, duly executed. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Common Stock Merger Consideration or
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled, may be issued with respect to such Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock to such a transferee if the
Certificates representing such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock are presented to the Paying Agent (or if lost, stolen or destroyed, the
procedures set forth in Section 2.6 are complied with), accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Any release of the
Holdback and the Additional Common Stock Merger Consideration and the
Additional Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, if any, shall be delivered
by the Paying Agent as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof.  (c)
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate (other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled pursuant
to Sections 2.1(d) and (e)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 2.2 and Section 2.9. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.  (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains unclaimed by the
former shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time
shall, upon demand of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation and all former shareholders of the Company shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims
for the Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration for their shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of shares for any Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  Section 2.3 Stock Options;
Warrants; Rights. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary action by an appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, to cause each 1996 Plan Option (as hereinafter defined) to convert
to the right to receive a cash payment pursuant to Section 9.9 of the Company
1996 Incentive Plan, as amended (the "1996 Incentive Plan"), such that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each 1996 Plan Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable,
shall be canceled and only entitle the holder thereof to receive as soon as
reasonably practicable after the surrender thereof, subject to Section 2.9
and Article VIII, cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount,
if any, by which the Common Stock Merger Consideration exceeds the per share
exercise price of such 1996 Plan Option times (ii) the number of shares of
Class A Common Stock into which such 1996 Plan Option is
exercisable; provided that any such payment shall be net of all withholding
taxes required to be withheld by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement,
"1996 Plan Option" shall mean an outstanding option to purchase Class A
Common Stock granted under the 1996 Incentive Plan.  (b) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action either to cause
(i) an appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to
cause each 1992 Plan Option (as hereinafter defined) to convert to the right
to receive a cash payment pursuant to the F.R. Acquisition Corp.-1992 Stock
Option Plan, as amended (the "1992 Option Plan") or (ii) each holder of
a 1992 Plan Option to execute a cancellation agreement, in each case such
that immediately prior to the Effective Time, each 1992 Plan Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be canceled and only entitle the holder thereof the right
to receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the surrender thereof,
subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII, cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the amount, if any, by which the Common Stock Merger
Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such 1992 Plan Option
times (ii) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock into which such 1992
Plan Option is exercisable; provided that any such payment shall be net of
all withholding taxes required to be withheld by the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, "1992 Plan Option" shall mean an outstanding option to
purchase Class B Common Stock granted under the 1992 Option Plan.  (c)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action by appropriate
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, to cause each Non-Plan
Class A Option (as hereinafter defined) to convert to the right to receive a
cash payment pursuant to the terms of each such Non-Plan Option such that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Non-Plan Class A
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then exercisable, shall be canceled and only entitle the holder thereof to
receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the surrender thereof,
subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII, cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the amount, if any, by which the Common Stock Merger
Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Non-Plan Class A
Option times (ii) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which
such Non-Plan Class A Option is exercisable; provided that any such payment
shall be net of all withholding taxes required to be withheld by the Company.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Plan Class A Option" shall mean an
outstanding option to purchase Class A Common Stock which is not granted
pursuant to any stock option or incentive plan.  (d) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary either to cause (i) an
appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to cause each
Warrant (as hereinafter defined) to convert to the right to receive a cash
payment pursuant to the terms of each such Warrant or (ii) each holder of a
Warrant to execute a cancellation agreement, in each case such that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Warrant outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be
canceled and only entitle the holder thereof the right to receive as soon
as reasonably practicable after the surrender thereof, subject to Section 2.9
and Article VIII, cash in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the
Common Stock Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of
such Warrant. For purposes of this Agreement, "Warrant" shall mean an
outstanding warrant to purchase Class A Common Stock.  (e) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as may be necessary such
that immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Right (as hereinafter
defined) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then exercisable, shall be canceled, retired and cease to exist, without any
payment therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, "Right" shall mean each
right attached to each outstanding share of Class C Common Stock and
issued pursuant to a Rights Agreement dated as of December 31, 1996 between
the Company and the persons or entities party thereto and a Rights Agreement
dated as of August 25, 1997 between the Company and the persons or entities
party thereto.  Section 2.4 Certain Adjustments. If at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction, or
any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Common
Stock Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and Preferred Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement.  Section 2.5 Withholding. The Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.  Section 2.6 Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article
II, provided that the Person to whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall,
as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give the Surviving
Corporation a written indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and, if deemed reasonably advisable
by the Surviving Corporation, a bond in such sum as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. "Person" means an individual,
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust or
other entity or organization.  Section 2.7 Stock Transfer Books. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock or

(2) the business of the Company is currently conducted in all respects
through the Subsidiaries.  Section 3.31 Accuracy of Statements. This

any action, or to do or cause to be done any things, which the Board, in
the exercise of its fiduciary duties, determines, in good faith after
consultation with its legal advisors, should not be taken or done). The

Parent and Merger Subsidiary will not purchase or otherwise become
a beneficial owner of any shares of Company Common Stock, any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Company Common Stock or any
shares of Company Preferred Stock without the prior written consent of the

each such Employee Benefit Plan  and Employee Agreement;   (ii) acknowledge
that for purposes of the Employee Benefit Plans and  Employee Agreements

liability, loss, damage, cost or expense, whenever asserted or claimed, based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, any matter
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Argonaut
Group, Inc. shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect for not less than six years after the Effective Time policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance equivalent in all material
respects to those maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the date hereof (and having at least the same coverage and
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the persons
currently covered by such policies as insured) with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; and Parent
and Argonaut Group, Inc., jointly and severally, in addition to the
indemnification provided above in this Section 5.8, shall indemnify the

Parent Breach"); provided, however, that, if such Terminating Parent Breach

compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement and the obligation to return or
hold Evaluation Material pursuant to the procedures set forth therein and in

7.1(b)(iii) and at the time  of the termination a third party shall have
made, and not revoked, a  bona fide Acquisition Proposal which is a Superior
Proposal and such  Acquisition Proposal is consummated prior to the first
anniversary of  such termination; or  (ii) by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii) or 7.1(c)  then in any such case described in clauses

in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement pertaining to them contained herein (after having been notified by
the Company of such breach and given at least a 30 day opportunity to cure
the same), the Company shall pay to Parent liquidated damages in an amount
equal to $4,950,000 (the "Liquidated Damage Amount"). Upon payment by the

payable under Section 7.3(b)(i), such amount shall be paid prior to the
consummation of the relevant Acquisition Proposal.  (e) If this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or the Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or 7.1(e),
as the case may be, then the party terminating this Agreement shall be
entitled to an amount equal to $4,950,000 (the "Breach Amount"). Upon payment
of the Breach Amount, the Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company, as the
case may be, shall be fully released and discharged from any liability or
obligation resulting from or under this Agreement.  (f) This Section 7.3
shall survive any termination of this Agreement indefinitely.  ARTICLE
VIII. HOLDBACK  Section 8.1 Merger Consideration Holdback. In order to
ensure that the representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company
under this Agreement are not breached and in order to provide for an
exclusive source of recovery by Argonaut Group, Inc., Parent and the
Surviving Corporation in the event of such a breach, the Company agrees that
$8,000,000 (the "Holdback") shall be deposited in an interest-bearing escrow
account (the Holdback, together with any additional monies received by the
Escrow Agent, as hereinafter defined, for inclusion in such account and any
interest earned thereon, the "Escrow Fund") pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an Escrow Agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit B
hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"), dated as of the Closing Date, among the
Shareholder Representatives, Parent and an escrow agent mutually agreed to by
the Company and Parent (the "Escrow Agent"). If the parties do not mutually
agree otherwise, the Escrow Agent shall be Harris Bank. The Holdback shall be
deposited with the Escrow Agent concurrently with the payment of the Payment
Fund (less the Holdback) to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2. The
Escrow Fund shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement, and the
Escrow Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.  Section 8.2 Recoverable Amounts.
(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund any liability, loss, damage, cost
or other expense incurred, or required to be recognized, by Argonaut Group,
Inc., Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Recoverable Amounts") arising out of any breach by the
Company of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company set forth
in this Agreement, provided that none of Argonaut Group, Inc., Parent
or Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to be paid any amounts under
this Section 8.2 other than on account of Qualifying Claims. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Qualifying Claim" shall mean (i) a claim for recovery out
of the Escrow Fund, (ii) arising out of or as a result of a single breach by
the Company of a representation, warranty or covenant, (iii) submitted prior
to the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (iv) which results in
Recoverable Amounts in excess of $3,000,000. Subject to the provisions
hereof, the Escrow Agent shall only be obligated to pay, and Argonaut Group,
Inc., Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall only be entitled to recover,
(1) the full amount of each Qualifying Claim, net of Claims Recoveries (as
defined in Section 8.2(d)(iv)) actually received by any of them (and not
merely recognized in accordance with GAAP or any other applicable reporting
requirement) at the time such Qualifying Claim is otherwise payable
hereunder, and (2) such net amount to the extent that any liability, loss,
damage, cost or other expense is actually incurred (and not merely recognized
in accordance with GAAP or any other applicable reporting requirement) by
Argonaut Group, Inc., Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be. The parties hereto acknowledge that even if
a claim at any time qualifies as a Qualifying Claim hereunder (and even if
the Shareholder Representatives have conceded the same for purposes of
Section 8.2(f)), no payment from the Escrow Fund shall be made in respect of
such Qualifying Claim unless, at the time payment is otherwise to be made
hereunder, the amount to be paid on account of such Qualifying Claim (without
considering Claim Recoveries) in fact exceeds $3,000,000. As among Argonaut
Insurance Company, Argonaut Midwest Insurance Company and
Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent shall allocate payments otherwise
payable to them hereunder in such proportion as they, in their discretion,
shall direct.  (b) In order to assert a claim under this Section 8.2, as
soon as reasonably possible after Parent obtains knowledge of a claim but in
any event not later than the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Shareholder
Representatives appointed pursuant to Section 8.4, with a copy to the Escrow
Agent, of such claim, which Claim Notice shall set forth the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such claim, the amount of Recoverable Amounts
asserted with respect thereto, and the basis for concluding that such claim
is a Qualifying Claim. Upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any claim hereunder, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall diligently pursue all commercially reasonable
alternative sources of recovery for such claim, including but not limited to
any applicable insurance policies, indemnifications or any other third party
arrangements which would offset or recoup such Recoverable Amounts.  (c)
Promptly following delivery of any Claim Notice with respect to a
claim, Parent and the Shareholder Representatives shall act in good faith
as expeditiously as possible to resolve such claim. In the event that any
such claim is not resolved by such parties within 30 days after delivery of
such Claim Notice, such claim may, at the instance of either the
Shareholder Representatives or Parent, be resolved by arbitration pursuant to
the provisions of Section 9.10. In the event of any such arbitration, the
Shareholder Representatives and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to
record an amount of the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of such disputed
claim as a sub-account of the Escrow Fund (a "Claims Reserve") until
resolution of such claim. If multiple claims are disputed, the Shareholder
Representatives and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to so record a sub-
account for each individual claim, each with the appropriate Claims Reserve.
The parties hereto acknowledge that aggregate Claims Reserves may exceed the
amount of the Escrow Fund. Such Claims Reserves shall be released as
follows:  (i) If any such arbitration results in a determination, finding,
order or judgment of the arbitrators that the claim submitted is a Qualifying
Claim, or the parties thereto otherwise settle such dispute in favor of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall be entitled to that amount of the associated Claims
Reserve equal to (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrators, or such amount
mutually agreed to by the parties thereto, as the case may be, plus (2) the
amount of all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in connection with such
arbitration or such lesser amount as may be determined by the arbitrators
pursuant to Section 9.10 or otherwise mutually agreed by the parties hereto,
which fees and expenses shall be paid from the Escrow Fund as a whole (such
amounts in clauses (1) and (2), together, "Claims Payments") plus (3) the
earnings on that portion of the associated Claims Reserve that is so awarded
or agreed upon pursuant to clause (1) above.  (ii) If any such arbitration
does not result in a determination, finding, order or judgment of the
arbitrators that the claim submitted is a Qualifying Claim and such
arbitration is concluded on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, the associated Claims Reserve, together with any earnings
thereon, shall be released from the associated sub-account and returned to
the Escrow Fund and be available for inclusion in any Claims Reserves
thereafter recorded and/or for distribution to the Paying Agent or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. In addition, in any such case, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Escrow
Fund for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder
Representatives in connection with such arbitration or such lesser amount as
may be determined by the arbitrators pursuant to Section 9.10.  (iii) If
any such arbitration does not result in a determination, finding, order or
judgment of the arbitrators that the claim submitted is a Qualifying
Claim and such arbitration is concluded after the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, such portion of the associated Claims Reserve, together with
any earnings thereon, shall be released (1) to the Escrow Agent in an amount
equal to the aggregate amount by which any remaining Claims Reserves exceed
the amount of the Escrow Fund, and (2) to the Paying Agent in an amount equal
to the excess thereof, which amount shall be distributed pursuant to Section
2.2. In addition, in any such case of a release of fund to the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay to the
Paying Agent for distribution pursuant to Section 2.2, an amount equal to all
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder
Representatives in connection with such arbitration, or such lesser amount as
may be determined by the arbitrators pursuant to Section 9.10, plus the Yield
Shortfall (as hereinafter defined), if any. (d) For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the  following meanings:  (i)
"Guaranteed Yield" shall mean, with respect to each Escrow Release,  interest
accrued thereon at a rate of 8% per annum, calculated from the  Closing Date
to and including the date of such Escrow Release.  (ii) "Yield Shortfall"
shall mean, with respect to each Escrow Release, that  amount by which the
Guaranteed Yield exceeds the amount of interest  actually earned on such
Escrow Release, calculated from the Closing  Date to and including the date
of such Escrow Release.  (iii) "Escrow Release" shall mean any release by
the Escrow Agent to the  Paying Agent out of the Escrow Fund including,
without limitation,  Claims Reserves or Claims Recoveries, but shall not
include any legal  fees and expenses paid from the Escrow Fund to the
Shareholder  Representatives pursuant to Section 8.4.  (iv) "Claims
Recoveries" shall mean the total amount of any insurance,  indemnity and any
other offset or recovery actually received by Parent  or the Surviving
Corporation for any claim or Qualifying Claim  excluding any Claims
Payments.  (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
Parent or Surviving Corporation receives Claims Recoveries, (i) prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, then promptly after receipt thereof,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay to the
Escrow Agent for deposit in the Escrow Fund an amount equal to such Claims
Recoveries, provided that in the event that such payment is not made to the
Escrow Agent, the amount of any Claims Payments thereafter made by the Escrow
Agent to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be
reduced by an amount equal to such Claims Recoveries not so paid, and (ii) on
or after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the fourth
anniversary of the earliest date on which the balance in the Escrow Fund
equals zero, then promptly after receipt thereof, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay to the Paying Agent for
distribution pursuant to Section 2.2, an amount equal to such Claims
Recoveries.  (f) Upon delivery of a Claim Notice asserting a Qualifying
Claim based upon a claim made by third parties against the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries:  (i) If the balance of the Escrow
Fund (exclusive of any amount in Claims  Reserves for unrelated disputed
claims) is less than 60% of the amount of  the Recoverable Amount that is the
subject of such Claim Notice, the Parent  or Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall have the right to  defend against such claim (including
the selection of counsel and  settlement of the claim), provided Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as  the case may be, shall keep the Shareholder
Representatives fully and  completely informed of the status of the claim at
all stages of the  proceedings thereof, and further provided that the
Shareholder  Representatives may elect to revoke such authority to defend
against such  claim at any time that it reasonably appears that the balance
in the Escrow  Fund (exclusive of any amount in Claims Reserves for unrelated
disputed  claims) is equal to not less than 60% of such Recoverable
Amount.  (ii) If (1) the balance of the Escrow Fund (exclusive of any amount
in Claims  Reserves for unrelated disputed claims) is equal to or greater
than 60% of  the amount of the Recoverable Amount that is the subject of such
Claim  Notice, and (2) the Shareholders Representatives have irrevocably
conceded  in writing that the third party claim is a Qualifying Claim, the 
Shareholder Representatives may elect to direct the defense of such claim 
(including the selection of counsel and settlement of the claim), provided 
the Shareholder Representatives shall keep Parent and the Surviving 
Corporation fully and completely informed of the status of the claim at all 
stages of the proceedings thereof, and further provided that Parent or the 
Surviving Corporation may elect to revoke such authority to defend against 
such claim at any time that it reasonably appears that the balance in the 
Escrow Fund (exclusive of any amount in Claims Reserves for unrelated 
disputed claims) is less than 60% of such Recoverable
Amount.  (iii)Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if
at any time  the balance of the Escrow Fund (including all amounts in Claims
Reserves)  is less than 60% of the aggregate of all Recoverable Amounts for
all then  pending Claim Notices, by written notice to the Shareholder 
Representatives, Parent and Surviving Corporation, in their sole  discretion,
may elect to revoke any authority of the Shareholder  Representatives to
defend any or all such claims of third parties and shall  have the right to
manage the defense of any claims thereafter arising.  In the case of clauses
(i) and (ii) above, any counsel so retained by Parent or Surviving or by the
Shareholder Representatives, as the case may be, shall acknowledge in writing
to the other party hereto the limitation on the authority of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or of the Shareholder Representatives, as the case may
be, under this Section 8.2(f).  (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that a Qualifying Claim
otherwise payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be paid to the
extent of the Escrow Fund even if any associated Claims Reserve is less than
the amount thereof.  Section 8.3 Release of Escrow Fund. (a) In the event
that on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, no Claim
Notice has been given pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 8.2,
then on first anniversary of the Closing Date, or as soon as possible
thereafter, (i) the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Paying Agent the Escrow
Fund (including, any interest earned on such monies deposited therein) and
(ii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Paying Agent an
amount equal to the Yield Shortfall.  (b) In the event that on or prior to
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, one or more Claim Notices have
been given pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 8.2, then on the
day after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, or as soon as possible
thereafter, and from time to time thereafter, (i) the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent the Escrow Fund to the extent it exceeds the
Claims Reserves that are then in existence (or which will be established as a
result of a Claim Notice upon the direction of the
Shareholder Representatives and Parent), including, any interest earned on
such monies so delivered, and (ii) concurrently with such delivery to the
Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Paying
Agent an amount equal to the Yield Shortfall with respect to such Escrow
Release.  (c) The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that the
aggregate amount of all Yield Shortfall payments under this Article VIII
shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the difference between (i) 8% per
annum with respect to the particular Escrow Release, and (ii) the amount of
interest actually earned on the aggregate balance of the Escrow Fund,
calculated from the Closing Date to and including the date the balance in the
Escrow Fund equals zero.  (d) Any monies released from the Escrow Fund to
the Paying Agent pursuant hereto and the Escrow Agreement shall be
distributed by the Paying Agent to the Holders in the same manner as the
balance of the Initial Common Stock Merger Consideration and the Initial
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration.  Section 8.4 Shareholder
Representatives. Upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
requisite vote of the holders of the Company Common Stock, each of Richard
Wright, J. Adam Abram and Alan Colner (collectively, the "Shareholder
Representatives" and each, a "Shareholder Representative") shall
be irrevocably appointed to act as the representatives for the Holders with
respect to all post-Closing matters requiring any action or decision by the
Shareholder Representatives as provided in this Article VIII. The
Shareholder Representatives are hereby authorized to take any and all such
actions and make any decisions necessary or desirable in connection with the
defense and/or settlement of any claims and the Escrow Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representatives may by written
notice to the Escrow Agent, with a copy to Parent, request payment for or
reimbursement of any and all reasonable legal fees and expenses paid or
payable by any of the Shareholder Representatives in connection with any
post-Closing matters requiring any action by the Shareholder Representatives
as provided in this Article VIII including, without limitation, the defense
and/or settlement of any claims and the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow
Agent shall be authorized to release from time to time from the Escrow Fund
an amount equal to such fees and expenses so requested unless, within ten
days after such notice the Parent objects to such payment by delivery of
notice to the Shareholder Representatives and the Escrow Agent, in which case
such fees and expenses will not be disbursed absent (1) agreement between the
Shareholder Representatives and the Parent or (2) a judgment of
the arbitrators in connection with the resolution of a claim that such fees
are reasonable and are not required to be reimbursed by Parent. Amounts so
released for such fees and expenses will in no event be taken into account
for purposes of any determination of the Yield Shortfall. Any notice or other
communication to be delivered to the Shareholder Representatives shall be
delivered to each of them pursuant to Section 9.3 and any notice or other
communication to be signed by the Shareholder Representatives shall be valid
and binding if signed by any two Shareholder Representatives. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on such appointment and treat
the Shareholder Representatives as the duly appointed representatives for the
Holders. If any Shareholder Representative shall be unable to serve, the
remaining Shareholder Representatives shall appoint a replacement therefor,
and if at any time only one Shareholder Representative is then serving, then
such Shareholder Representative is authorized to act alone pursuant to this
Section 8.4. Each Shareholder Representative, by execution hereof, confirms
such appointment and authority and acknowledges and agrees that such
appointment is irrevocable, it being understood that the willingness of
Parent to enter into this Agreement is based, in part, on the appointment of
a representative to act for such post-Closing matters. In acting as the
representative of the Holders, the Shareholder Representatives may rely upon,
and shall not be liable to any Holder for acting or refraining from acting
upon, an opinion of counsel, certificate of auditors or other certificates,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
arbitrator\'s award, appraisal, bond other paper or document reasonably
believed by him to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties. No Shareholder Representative shall incur any
liability to any Holder with respect to any action taken or suffered by him
in his capacity as Shareholder Representative in reliance upon any
note, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed
by him to be genuinely and duly authorized. In addition, no Shareholder
Representative shall incur any liability to any Holder for any action or
inaction except his own fraud or willful misconduct. Each Shareholder
Representative may perform his duties as Shareholder Representatives either
directly or by or through his agents or attorneys and no Shareholder
Representative shall be responsible to any other Holder for any misconduct or
negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with reasonable

[Argonaut Group Inc. Logo]    May 7,
2001  =================== -------------------  Dear ____________:  
This letter is to confirm our agreement regarding all of the shares of Class
A Common Stock, no par value, Class B Common Stock, no par value and Class C
Common Stock, no par value common stock (collectively "FRINC Common Stock")
of Front Royal, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"),
beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by you and any other shares of FRINC Common
Stock as to which you may hereafter acquire beneficial ownership
(collectively, the "Shares").   The Shares owned as of the date hereof are
listed on Schedule 1 hereto. In order to induce Argonaut Insurance Company, a
California corporation, Argonaut Midwest Insurance Company, an Illinois
corporation (together, "Buyer") and its affiliates, to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 7, 2001, by and among the
Buyer, Argonaut Acquisition Corp. and the Company (the "Merger Agreement"),
you hereby agree as follows:   1. You hereby represent and warrant as to the
Shares that (i) you are the sole owner of and/or have full right, power and
authority to vote the Shares, and this letter agreement is a valid and
binding agreement, enforceable against you, in accordance with its terms, and
(ii) neither the execution of this letter agreement nor the consummation by
you of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a violation of,
or conflict with, or default under, any contract, commitment, agreement,
understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which you are a
party or by which you or the Shares are bound. You further confirm that you
are a member in good standing of the board of directors of the Company.  
2. You hereby agree not to sell, transfer or encumber the Shares prior to the
later of (i) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms and (ii) the date on which this letter agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms.   3. You agree to vote or cause
to be voted all of the Shares (i) in favor of approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the Merger (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) against any other mergers,
recapitalizations, business combinations, sales of assets, liquidations or
similar transactions involving the Company, or any other matters which would
be inconsistent with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby. In furtherance of your voting agreement in this paragraph, you
hereby revoke any and all previous proxies with respect to any of the Shares
and grant to Buyer and such individuals or corporations as Buyer may
designate an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the Shares owned by you in
accordance with this paragraph on any matters which may be presented
to shareholders of the Company with respect to any matters related to the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, the Merger or any
other mergers, recapitalizations, business combinations, sales of assets,
liquidations or similar transactions involving the Company, or any other
matters which would be inconsistent with the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby or the Merger. You hereby acknowledge that
the proxy granted by the foregoing is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. In addition, you hereby agree to execute such additional
documents as Buyer may reasonably request to effectuate its proxy and voting
rights under this paragraph.   4. We each hereby agree that this letter
agreement creates legally binding commitments, enforceable in accordance with
their terms. This letter agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties hereto with respect to the matter hereof and (ii) supersedes all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement is
not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
hereunder.   5. This letter agreement may be terminated (i) at any time by
mutual written consent of the parties hereto or (ii) by either party on or
after the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms; provided, however, that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), 7.1(b)(iii) or 7.1(c) of the Merger
Agreement, it shall be a condition precedent to your right to terminate this
letter agreement that you pay to Buyer an amount (the "Spread") equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares and (y) the difference between the Offer
Price (as defined below) and Common Stock Merger Consideration as applied to
the Shares. No termination of this letter agreement shall relieve either
party from liability for any breach of this letter agreement. You acknowledge
that the agreements contained in this paragraph 5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this letter agreement and that, without these
agreements, Buyer would not enter into the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, if
you fail to pay promptly the Spread due pursuant to this paragraph 5 and, in
order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit that results in a
judgment against you for the Spread, you shall pay to Buyer (in addition to
the Spread) all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors, actuaries and accountants)
incurred by Buyer in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the Spread at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date
that such payment was required to be made. For purposes of this paragraph 5,
the term "Offer Price" shall mean the price per share of FRINC Common Stock
to be paid by any third party pursuant to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
in the Merger Agreement).   6. You acknowledge that irreparable damage to
Buyer would occur in the event that you do not perform any provision of this
letter agreement in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breach
this letter agreement. You agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by you of any covenant or obligation contained in this
letter agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to seek and obtain (i) a decree or
order of specific performance to enforce the performance of such covenant or
obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach. You further agree that Buyer shall not be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any remedy referred to in this paragraph 6, and you hereby
irrecoverably waive any right that you may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.   7. This
letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of New York. Each
of the parties shall pay its own expenses in connection with the execution
and performance of this letter agreement.   8. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction of this letter agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this letter agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, and there shall be deemed substituted for the
provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable provision as similar as
possible to the provision at issue.        Please indicate your
agreement to the foregoing by signing this letter agreement in the space
provided below, whereupon a binding agreement will have been formed between
us in respect of the foregoing.   Sincerely,   ARGONAUT INSURANCE

signed jointly by Shareholder Representatives and Parent and agreed to by the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its
duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands
which, in its opinion, are in conflict with any of the provisions of this
Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action
other than to keep safely, all property held in escrow until it shall jointly
be directed otherwise in writing by the Shareholder Representatives and
Parent or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.   6.

written notice, demand, certificate or document which it, in good faith,
believes to be genuine.   7. No Legal Proceedings. The Escrow Agent shall
not be required to institute legal proceedings of any kind and shall not be
required to defend any legal proceedings which may be instituted against
it.        8. Deposit Into Court. If the Escrow Agent at any time,
in its sole discretion, deems it necessary or advisable to relinquish custody
of the Escrow Fund, it may do so by delivering the same to any other escrow
agent mutually agreeable to the Shareholder Representatives and Parent and if
no such escrow agent shall be selected, then the Escrow Agent may do so by
delivering the Escrow Fund (a) to any bank or trust company in the Borough of
Manhattan, City and State of New York, which is willing to act as escrow
agent thereunder in place and instead of the Escrow Agent or (b) to the clerk
or other proper officer of a court of competent jurisdiction as may be
permitted by law within the State, County and City of New York. The fee of
any such bank or trust company or court officer shall be borne jointly and
severally by the Shareholder Representatives, on the one hand, and Parent, on
the other hand. Upon such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from
any and all further responsibility or liability with respect to the Escrow
Fund except as herein provided.   9. No Fiduciary Duty. The Escrow
Agreement shall not create any fiduciary duty on the Escrow Agent\'s part to
the Shareholder Representatives or Parent or any of their respective
affiliates, nor disqualify the Escrow Agent from representing the Shareholder
Representatives or any of their affiliates in any dispute with Parent or any
of its affiliates including, without limitation, any dispute with respect to
the Merger Agreement.   10. Expenses. The out-of-pocket expenses paid or
incurred by the Escrow Agent in the administration of its duties hereunder,
including, but not limited to, all counsel and advisors\' and agents\' fees
including, without limitation, counsel fees under paragraph 5 hereof, and all
taxes or other governmental charges, if any, shall be paid jointly and
severally from the Escrow Fund and by Parent. Each of Parent and the
Shareholder Representatives hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver to
the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to any and all such
out-of-pocket expenses and taxes or other governmental charges.   11.
Indemnification of Escrow Agent. Parent hereby indemnifies and holds the
Escrow Agent harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, tax,
liability and expense that may be incurred by the Escrow Agent, arising
out of or in connection with its acceptance of appointment as the Escrow
Agent hereunder, or the performance of its duties pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement, including all legal costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent
defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with its
performance hereunder; provided that each of Parent and the Shareholder
Representatives hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to any and all such loss, damage,
tax, liability and expense.   12. Notices. All notices, requests, demands
and other communications hereunder shall be in writing, with copies to all
the other parties hereto, and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i)
