                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this  "Agreement"),  dated as of May 7, 2001,
among Front Royal, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"),  Argonaut
Insurance Company, a California corporation, Argonaut Midwest Insurance Company,
an Illinois corporation (together,  "Parent"), and Argonaut Acquisition Corp., a
North  Carolina  corporation  and a wholly owned  subsidiary of Parent  ("Merger
Subsidiary").
                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS,  the respective  Boards of Directors of Parent,  Merger Subsidiary
and the Company have  approved  this  Agreement and deem it advisable and in the
best  interests  of their  respective  shareholders  to  consummate  the  merger
provided  for herein,  in which Merger  Subsidiary  will merge with and into the
Company (the  "Merger"),  on the terms and subject to the  conditions  set forth
herein;

     WHEREAS,  the Board of  Directors  of the Company  (the  "Board")  has: (a)
determined  that  the  Merger  is  fair  to  and in the  best  interests  of the
shareholders  of the Company;  (b) approved this Agreement and the  transactions
contemplated   hereby;   and  (c)  resolved  to  recommend  that  the  Company's
shareholders  approve and adopt this  Agreement  and the Merger,  subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing  and the  respective
representations,  warranties,  covenants and  agreements  set forth herein,  the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.        THE MERGER

Section  1.1  Merger.  Subject  to the  terms and  conditions  set forth in this
Agreement,  and in accordance with the North Carolina  Business  Corporation Act
("NCBCA"),  at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), Merger Subsidiary
shall be merged with and into the Company.  Following  the Merger,  the separate
corporate  existence  of Merger  Subsidiary  shall cease and the  Company  shall
continue as the surviving  corporation  and a wholly owned  subsidiary of Parent
(the  Company  following  the  Merger,  the  "Surviving  Corporation").  At  the
Effective  Time,  the  Merger  will  have  the  other  effects  provided  in the
applicable  provisions  of the NCBCA.  Without  limiting the  generality  of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,  rights,
privileges,  powers,  immunities  and  franchises  of  the  Company  and  Merger
Subsidiary  will  vest  in  the  Surviving  Corporation,   and  all  the  debts,
liabilities,  obligations  and duties of the Company and Merger  Subsidiary will
become  the  debts,  liabilities,   obligations  and  duties  of  the  Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.2  Effective  Time of the Merger.  Subject to the  provisions  of this
Agreement,  on the  Closing  Date (as defined in Section  1.3),  the Company and
Merger  Subsidiary will cause  appropriate  articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") to be executed  and filed with the  Secretary  of State of the State of
North Carolina in such form as required by, and executed in accordance  with the
relevant  provisions  of,  NCBCA  Section  55-11-05.  The  Merger  shall  become
effective  on the date and at the time when the Articles of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of North  Carolina or, subject to
the NCBCA,  such time as is agreed  upon by the  parties  and  specified  in the
Articles of Merger (such effective time, the "Effective Time.")

Section 1.3 Closing.  Unless this Agreement  shall have been  terminated and the
Merger herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1 and
subject to the  satisfaction  or waiver of the conditions to the  obligations of
the parties to effect the Merger as set forth in Article VI, the consummation of
the Merger (the "Closing")  shall take place as promptly as practicable,  but in
no event  later  than  10:00  a.m.  on the second  Business  Day  following  the
satisfaction  or waiver of all of the  conditions and  obligations  set forth in
Article VI of this Agreement  (excluding  any conditions  that, by their nature,
cannot be  satisfied  until the  Closing) at the  offices of Robinson  Silverman
Pearce  Aronsohn & Berman LLP, 1290 Avenue of the Americas,  New York,  New York
10104, unless another date, time and/or place is agreed to by the parties hereto
(the "Closing Date").

Section 1.4 Articles of Incorporation  and Bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation.
The articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect  immediately  prior to
the  Effective  Time shall be the  articles of  incorporation  of the  Surviving
Corporation but shall,  effective at the Effective Time, be amended and restated
in a form reasonably  satisfactory to the Parent and the Company.  The bylaws of
Merger Subsidiary as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,  until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein, in the articles of incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation
or by applicable law.

Section 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving  Corporation.  The directors
of Merger  Subsidiary  immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall,  from and
after the Effective  Time, be the directors of the Surviving  Corporation  until
their  successors  shall have been duly  elected or appointed  and  qualified or
until  their  earlier  death,  resignation  or  removal in  accordance  with the
Surviving  Corporation's  articles of  incorporation  and bylaws or as otherwise
provided by law. The officers of the Merger Subsidiary  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall,  from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving  Corporation  until their  respective  successors  are chosen and have
qualified in  accordance  with the articles of  incorporation  and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law.

ARTICLE II.       CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 2.1 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary,  the Company or
the holders of any shares of Company  Common Stock (as  hereinafter  defined) or
Company Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined):

(a) Subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII,  each share of Class A Common Stock
("Class A Common  Stock"),  Class B Common Stock ("Class B Common  Stock"),  and
Class C Common Stock ("Class C Common Stock"), each no par value, of the Company
(collectively,  the "Company Common Stock") issued and  outstanding  immediately
prior to the  Effective  Time  (other  than  the  Company  Stock to be  canceled
pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) below and any Dissenting  Shares (as defined
in Section  2.8)) shall be converted  into and  represent  the right to receive,
payable upon surrender of the  certificate  or  certificates  which  immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock in the manner  provided in Section 2.2,  $13.6938 per share in cash
(the "Initial  Common Stock Merger  Consideration")  and the  Additional  Common
Stock  Merger  Consideration  (as defined in Section  2.9),  if any (the Initial
Common  Stock  Merger  Consideration  and the  Additional  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration   are  referred  to  collectively  as  the  "Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration"),  payable to the holder  thereof  without  interest,  subject to
adjustment as set forth below. All such Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically  be canceled and retired
and shall  cease to exist,  and each  holder of a  certificate  or  certificates
previously   evidencing   such  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock   outstanding
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time shall  cease to have any rights  with
respect   thereto,   except  the  right  to  receive  the  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration  for each share of Company Common Stock upon the surrender of such
certificates  in accordance  with Section 2.2. Any payment made pursuant to this
Section 2.1(a) shall be made net of applicable  withholding  taxes to the extent
such withholding is required by law.

(b) Subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII,  each share of Series A Convertible
Preferred  Stock,  par  value  $100 per  share,  of the  Company  (the  "Company
Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than the Company  Preferred Stock to be canceled  pursuant to subsections
(d) and (e)  below  and any  Dissenting  Shares)  shall  be  converted  into and
represent the right to receive,  payable upon  surrender of the  certificate  or
certificates  which immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented  issued
and  outstanding  shares of Company  Preferred  Stock in the manner  provided in
Section 2.2, the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (as hereinafter  defined),
payable to the holder thereof without interest.  For purposes of this Agreement,
(i)  "Preferred  Stock Merger  Consideration"  shall mean the Initial  Preferred
Stock  Merger   Consideration   and  the  Additional   Preferred   Stock  Merger
Consideration  (as defined in Section  2.9) and (ii)  "Initial  Preferred  Stock
Merger  Consideration"  shall mean an amount  equal to 16-2/3  times the Initial
Common Stock Merger  Consideration.  All such Company  Preferred Stock,  when so
converted,  shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically  be canceled
and  retired  and shall  cease to exist,  and each  holder of a  certificate  or
certificates  previously  evidencing  such  shares of  Company  Preferred  Stock
outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time shall  cease to have any
rights with respect  thereto,  except the right to receive the  Preferred  Stock
Merger  Consideration  for  each  share  of  Company  Preferred  Stock  upon the
surrender of such  certificates in accordance with Section 2.2. Any payment made
pursuant to this  Section  2.1(b)  shall be made net of  applicable  withholding
taxes to the extent such withholding is required by law.

(c) Each  share of common  stock of Merger  Subsidiary  issued  and  outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective  Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation,
which will constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving  Corporation  immediately after the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, each outstanding certificate theretofore representing shares
of common stock of Merger Subsidiary will be deemed for all purposes to evidence
ownership  and to  represent  the same  number of shares of common  stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) Each share of Company  Common  Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by the Company
or any  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of the  Company  as  treasury  stock  shall be
canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution  shall be
made with respect thereto.

(e) Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held of record
by Parent or Merger  Subsidiary  or any other  direct or  indirect  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (other than in each case, shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts,  custodial  accounts and the like that are beneficially owned by third
parties)  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,  be canceled and cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(f) As a result of the Merger and  without  any action on the part of the holder
thereof,  at the Effective  Time, all shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist,  and each holder of such shares shall thereafter cease
to have any rights  with  respect  to such  shares of  Company  Common  Stock or
Company  Preferred  Stock,  except the right to receive the Common  Stock Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be.

Section 2.2       Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares

(a)  Prior to the  Effective  Time,  Parent or  Merger  Subsidiary  shall
designate  First Union National Bank or such other paying agent mutually  agreed
to by the parties  hereto (the  "Paying  Agent") to act as paying  agent for the
holders  of shares  of  Company  Common  Stock and  Company  Preferred  Stock in
connection with the Merger, and shall enter into an agreement  providing for the
matters  set forth in this  Section  2.2,  Section  2.9 and Section 8.3 and such
other matters as may be appropriate,  the form and terms of which are reasonably
satisfactory  to the  Company,  for  the  payment  of the  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration and the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited,  with or for the account of the Paying  Agent,  for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled pursuant to Sections 2.1(d) and
(e)),  an amount in cash equal to the  aggregate  Initial  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration and Initial Preferred Stock Merger Consideration  payable pursuant
to this  Section 2.2,  less the  Holdback to be deposited  with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 8.1 (such cash funds,  the "Payment  Fund").  Any  interest,
dividends or other income  earned from  investment  of the Payment Fund shall be
for the account of the Surviving  Corporation.  At the direction of Parent,  the
Paying Agent may invest the Payment Fund in  obligations  of, or guaranteed  by,
the United States of America,  in  commercial  paper  obligations  receiving the
highest investment grade rating from both Moody's Investors  Services,  Inc. and
Standard & Poor's,  a division  of McGraw  Hill,  Inc.,  or in  certificates  of
deposit,  bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding  $100,000,000  (collectively,  "Permitted  Investments");
provided, however, that the maturities of Permitted Investments shall be such as
to permit the Paying  Agent to make  prompt  payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock  pursuant to the Merger.  Such
funds  held by the  Paying  Agent  shall not be used for any  purpose  except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.

(b)  Promptly  after the  Effective  Time,  and in any event no later than three
business days following the Effective  Time,  Parent or Merger  Subsidiary  will
cause the  Paying  Agent to mail to each  holder of record of a  certificate  or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced  outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (the  "Certificates"),
whose  shares were  converted  pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive
the  Common  Stock  Merger   Consideration   or  the   Preferred   Stock  Merger
Consideration,  respectively  (i) a letter of  transmittal  (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates
shall pass,  only upon  delivery of such  Certificates  to the Paying  Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other  provisions  as the Company and Merger
Subsidiary may reasonably  specify) and (ii)  instructions  for use in effecting
the  surrender of the  Certificates  in exchange for payment of the Common Stock
Merger  Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration,  as the case may
be. Upon surrender of a Certificate  for  cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be  appointed by the  Company,  together  with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as
may be required  pursuant to such  instructions,  the holder of such Certificate
shall be  entitled  to receive in  exchange  therefor  the Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock,  respectively,  formerly represented by
such  Certificate,  without any interest thereon (other than pursuant to Article
VIII),  less  any  required   withholding  of  taxes,  and  the  Certificate  so
surrendered  shall  forthwith  be  canceled.  The Initial  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration  or  Initial  Preferred  Stock  Merger   Consideration  (less  the
Holdback)  will be  delivered  by the Paying  Agent as promptly  as  practicable
following surrender of a Certificate and the related transmittal documents, duly
executed.  In the event of a transfer of  ownership  of Company  Common Stock or
Company  Preferred Stock which is not registered in the transfer  records of the
Company,  the Common  Stock  Merger  Consideration  or  Preferred  Stock  Merger
Consideration  and any dividends or other  distributions to which such holder is
entitled,  may be issued with  respect to such  Company  Common Stock or Company
Preferred  Stock to such a  transferee  if the  Certificates  representing  such
Company  Common  Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock are  presented to the Paying
Agent (or if lost, stolen or destroyed,  the procedures set forth in Section 2.6
are complied with), accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.  Any  release of the  Holdback  and the  Additional  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration and the Additional Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration,  if any,
shall be delivered by the Paying Agent as promptly as practicable  after receipt
thereof.

(c) Until  surrendered  as  contemplated  by this Section 2.2, each  Certificate
(other than  Dissenting  Shares and shares to be  canceled  pursuant to Sections
2.1(d)  and (e))  shall  be  deemed  at any time  after  the  Effective  Time to
represent  only the right to receive the Common  Stock Merger  Consideration  or
Preferred  Stock Merger  Consideration  as  contemplated by this Section 2.2 and
Section 2.9. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any Common Stock Merger
Consideration  or  Preferred  Stock Merger  Consideration  payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(d) Any  portion of the  Payment  Fund  which  remains  unclaimed  by the former
shareholders  of the Company for 180 days after the Effective  Time shall,  upon
demand of the Surviving  Corporation,  be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
and all former  shareholders  of the Company shall  thereafter  look only to the
Surviving  Corporation  for payment of their  claims for the Common Stock Merger
Consideration  or  Preferred  Stock  Merger   Consideration  for  their  shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares for any Common Stock Merger
Consideration  or  Preferred  Stock Merger  Consideration  delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

Section 2.3 Stock Options;  Warrants;  Rights.  (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary  action by an appropriate  committee of the
Board  of  Directors  of the  Company,  to  cause  each  1996  Plan  Option  (as
hereinafter  defined) to convert to the right to receive a cash payment pursuant
to Section  9.9 of the  Company  1996  Incentive  Plan,  as  amended  (the "1996
Incentive  Plan"),  such that immediately prior to the Effective Time, each 1996
Plan Option outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then  exercisable,  shall be canceled  and only  entitle  the holder  thereof to
receive as soon as reasonably  practicable after the surrender thereof,  subject
to Section 2.9 and Article  VIII,  cash in an amount equal to the product of (i)
the amount, if any, by which the Common Stock Merger  Consideration  exceeds the
per share  exercise  price of such 1996 Plan  Option  times  (ii) the  number of
shares of Class A Common Stock into which such 1996 Plan Option is  exercisable;
provided that any such payment shall be net of all withholding taxes required to
be withheld by the Company.  For purposes of this Agreement,  "1996 Plan Option"

be canceled and only entitle the holder  thereof the right to receive as soon as

without any payment therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, "Right" shall mean
each right attached to each outstanding share of Class C Common Stock and issued

date of this  Agreement and the Effective  Time,  any change in the  outstanding
shares  of  capital   stock  of  the  Company  shall  occur  by  reason  of  any
reclassification,   recapitalization,  stock  split  or  combination,  exchange,
exchange or readjustment  of shares,  or any similar  transaction,  or any stock

Consideration  and Preferred Stock Merger  Consideration  shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company  Common Stock and Preferred
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 2.5 Withholding. The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from the  consideration  otherwise  payable
pursuant to this  Agreement  to any holder of shares of Company  Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock such amounts as the Surviving  Corporation or the Paying
Agent is  required  to deduct and  withhold  with  respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal,  state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving  Corporation  or the Paying
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having  been paid to the  holder of the shares of  Company  Common  Stock and
Company  Preferred  Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Section 2.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost,  stolen or  destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of
that  fact by the  Person  claiming  such  Certificate  to be  lost,  stolen  or
destroyed,  the Paying  Agent will issue in  exchange  for such lost,  stolen or
destroyed  Certificate the Common Stock Merger  Consideration or Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration  deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance

advisable  by the  Surviving  Corporation,  a bond in such sum as the  Surviving
Corporation  may direct as indemnity  against any claim that may be made against
the Surviving  Corporation with respect to the Certificate  claimed to have been
lost,   stolen  or  destroyed.   "Person"  means  an  individual,   corporation,
partnership,  limited liability company,  association,  trust or other entity or
organization.

Section 2.7 Stock Transfer  Books.  After the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further  registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving  Corporation of shares
of  Company  Common  Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock  which were  outstanding
immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time.  If,  after  the  Effective  Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation,  they shall be canceled
and their holders shall be entitled to the rights provided herein.

Section 2.8 Dissenters'  Rights.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to
the  contrary,  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock or  Company  Preferred  Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of the  Merger  and who has  delivered  a written  demand for
appraisal of such shares in accordance  with Section  55-13-21 of the NCBCA,  if
Section  55-13-02 of the NCBCA provides for appraisal  rights for such shares of
Company  Common  Stock or Company  Preferred  Stock in the  Merger  ("Dissenting
Shares"),  shall not be  converted  into the right to receive  the Common  Stock
Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as provided in
Section 2.1 hereof, unless and until such holder is no longer able to perfect or
effectively  withdraws  or otherwise  loses his right to  appraisal  and payment
under the NCBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder is no longer able
to  perfect  or  effectively  withdraws  or loses his right to  appraisal,  such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of
the  Effective   Time  into  the  right  to  receive  the  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration  or the Preferred  Stock Merger  Consideration,  without  interest
thereon.  The  Company  shall give  Parent (a) prompt  notice of any demands for
appraisal  pursuant to Section  55-13-21 of the NCBCA  received by the  Company,
withdrawals  of such demands and any other  instruments  served  pursuant to the
NCBCA  and  received  by the  Company  and (b) the  opportunity  to  direct  all
negotiations  and  proceedings  with respect to demands for appraisal  under the
NCBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or
as otherwise  required by  applicable  law, make any payment with respect to any
such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Class B Common Stock,  Class C Common Stock,  Company Preferred Stock, 1996 Plan
Options,  1992 Plan Options,  Non-Plan Class A Options and Warrants  (other than
Company Common Stock canceled  pursuant to Section  2.1(d),  (e) and (f) and any
Dissenting Shares  (collectively,  "Excluded Shares"))  (collectively,  "Company
Securities")   shall  be  entitled  to  Additional   Merger   Consideration  (as
hereinafter  defined) in the amounts and at the times set forth in this  Section
2.9. Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent promptly after each  Computation
Date an  amount  equal to the  Additional  Merger  Consideration  due as at such
Computation Date, which shall be held and invested in Permitted Investments in a
payment  fund in  accordance  with  Section 2.2 (the  "Additional  Consideration
Payment Fund").  The Paying Agent shall, at any time when the Additional Payment
Fund is more than $750,000,  and after the Final Computation Date, distribute to
the Holders all amounts in the Additional Consideration Payment Fund as follows:

(i)       each Holder of Class A Common Stock,  Class B Common Stock and Class C
          Common Stock shall be paid, for each share of Company Common Stock, an
          amount equal to (1) (A) the Total Additional Merger Consideration then
          being  distributed  divided by (B) an amount equal to 13,590,262  less
          the number of Excluded Shares,  if any (the  "Additional  Common Stock
          Merger  Consideration") plus (2) any earnings on the Additional Common
          Stock Merger  Consideration then held in the Additional  Consideration

          Stock Consideration");

(ii)      each Holder of Company  Preferred  Stock shall be paid, for each share
          of Company  Preferred  Stock,  an amount equal to (1)16-2/3  times the
          Additional   Common  Stock  Merger   Consideration   (the  "Additional
          Preferred  Stock Merger  Consideration")  plus (2) any earnings on the
          Additional  Preferred  Stock  Merger  Consideration  then  held in the
          Additional Consideration Payment Fund;

(iii)     each  Holder  of 1996  Plan  Options  shall  be paid an  amount,  with
          respect to each such 1996 Plan Option, equal to the Total Common Stock
          Additional Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Class A
          Common  Stock  into  which  such  1996  Plan  Option  was  exercisable
          immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(iv)      each Holder of 1992 Plan Options shall be paid an amount, with respect
          to each such 1992 Plan Option,  equal to the Total  Additional  Common
          Stock  Consideration  multiplied  by the  number  of shares of Class B
          Common  Stock  into  which  such  1992  Plan  Option  was  exercisable
          immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(v)       each Holder of Non-Plan Class A Options shall be paid an amount,  with
          respect  to each  such  Non-Plan  Class A  Option,  equal to the Total
          Additional  Common  Stock  Consideration  multiplied  by the number of
          shares of Class A Common Stock into which such Non-Plan Class A Option
          was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(vi)      each  Holder of  Warrants  shall be paid,  with  respect  to each such
          Warrant,  an  amount  equal  to  the  Total  Additional  Common  Stock
          Consideration  multiplied  by the  number  of shares of Class A Common
          Stock into which such Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the
          Effective Time.

(b)       Any payment  made  pursuant  to this  Section 2.9 shall be made net of
          applicable  withholding  taxes  to  the  extent  such  withholding  is
          required by law.

(c)      For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
         following meanings:

(i)      "Computation  Date" shall mean the day after the first  anniversary of
          the  Closing  Date  and  each  anniversary  thereof  until  the  Final
          Computation Date.

(ii)     "Additional  Merger  Consideration"  as of any Computation  Date shall
          mean  (A)  $2,500,000,  less  (B) any  amounts  of  Additional  Merger
          Consideration  theretofore  deposited  by Parent with the Paying Agent
          pursuant to Section  2.9(a),  less (C) any Claims Payments (as defined
          in Section 8.2(c)) theretofore made out of the Escrow Fund (as defined
          in Section  8.1)  pursuant  to Article  VIII,  less (D) the  principal
          balance  of  any  Claims  Reserves  established  by the  Escrow  Agent
          pursuant to Article VIII that are then in existence  (or which will be
          established  as a result of a Claim  Notice upon the  direction of the
          Shareholder   Representatives   and  Parent),   plus  (E)  any  Claims
          Recoveries  theretofore  paid into the  Escrow  Fund or to the  Paying
          Agent pursuant to Article VIII.

(iii)     "Final  Computation  Date"  shall mean the  earlier of (A) the date on
          which  Parent  and the  Shareholder  Representatives  (as  defined  in
          Section 8.4) determine that no Additional Merger  Consideration is due
          by reason  of  Claims  Payments,  or (B) when the  total  deposits  of
          Additional  Merger  Consideration  pursuant  to Section  2.9(a)  equal
          $2,500,000.  The parties  acknowledge  that the  determination  of the
          Final Computation Date is an arbitrable matter under Section 9.10.

(d) On or promptly  following each Computation  Date, Parent shall submit to the
Shareholder  Representatives a statement,  signed by the Chief Financial Officer
of Parent,  setting forth a computation of any Additional  Merger  Consideration
then payable.  The Shareholder  Representatives  shall have the right to request
and receive from Parent reasonable backup documentation with respect to any such
computation.  In the  event the  Shareholder  Representatives  dispute  any such
computation and Parent and the Shareholder  Representatives  cannot resolve such
dispute, then the Shareholder Representatives may bring an action in arbitration
pursuant to Section 9.10 to seek an adjudication of the dispute.

(e)  The  parties  hereto  acknowledge  that  Section  2.9(a)  presumes  that no
Dissenting Shares exist. If Dissenting  Shares in fact arise,  computations will
be adjusted to effect the  intention of the parties that the  Additional  Merger
Consideration is not payable in respect of Dissenting Shares (and that no Holder
is entitled to any part of the Additional Merger Consideration otherwise payable
in respect of Dissenting Shares).

aggregate,  would not be reasonably  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has previously  delivered or made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of each of its Subsidiaries'  articles of incorporation and bylaws,
as  currently  in  effect.  The  Company  has made all  required  filings  under
applicable  insurance holding company statutes except where the failure to file,

Material Adverse Effect.

of its  Subsidiaries is as set forth on Section 3.2 of the Disclosure  Schedule.
All the issued and  outstanding  shares of the Company's  capital stock are duly

companies  or the rights of  creditors  generally  and (b) the effect of general
principles of equity  (regardless of whether  enforceability  is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

Section 3.4 No Violations;  Approvals. (a) Neither the execution and delivery of

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No filing or registration with,  notification to, or authorization,  consent
or approval of, any court,  legislative,  executive or  regulatory  authority or
agency (each a "Governmental Entity") is legally required in connection with the

accordance with United States generally accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP")
applied on a consistent  basis during the periods  involved (except as otherwise

periods presented therein.

(b) The Company has  previously  made  available to Parent  complete and correct
copies of the audited statutory  financial  statements and the annual statements
of each of the  Company  Insurance  Subsidiaries  as filed  with  the  insurance
commissioner or other  appropriate  official for its respective  jurisdiction of

          benefits)  pending or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company,  threatened
          involving any Employee Benefit Plan or the assets thereof and no facts
          exist  which  could  give  rise to any such  actions,  suits or claims

          unilaterally amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.

(d)  Except  as set forth in  Section  3.8(d) of the  Disclosure  Schedule,  the

or suspension would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

and is  enforceable  against the Company or the  applicable  Subsidiary  a party
thereto in  accordance  with its terms,  except  where the failure to be in full
force  and  effect  or to be  enforceable  would  not,  individually  or in  the
aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There does
not exist under any  Material  Contract  any default or condition or event that,
after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
the Company or any Subsidiary  or, to the knowledge of the Company,  on the part
of any other parties to such Material Contract,  except for such defaults which,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The execution , delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby

termination  of any  provision  of, or constitute a default (with or without the
giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any right

in any  material  respect as to any  provision  thereof,  and no such  agreement
contains any provision providing that the other party thereto may terminate such
agreement by reason of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement  except
for such treaties or agreements  the default  under or  termination  of which as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in
a cost to the  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries  of an  amount  in excess of
$500,000. Except as set forth in Section 3.17(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has not received any notice to the effect that the  financial  condition

engage in negotiations  or discussions  with, or furnish any information or data
to,  any  third  party  relating  to an  Acquisition  Proposal  (other  than the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement).  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  contained  in  this  Agreement,  the  Company  and its  Board  (i) may
participate in negotiations or discussions (including, as a part thereof, making
any  counterproposal)  with or furnish information or data to any third party if

breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board.

direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity

Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, and (3) merger, consolidation or other business
combination,  sale of shares of capital stock,  tender offer,  or exchange offer

whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets
of  the  Company  and  its  Subsidiaries,  taken  as a  whole,  other  than  the
transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and  (ii)  the  term  "Superior
Proposal" shall mean any bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third party on
terms and conditions which the Board determines in its good faith judgment to be
more favorable than the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.3 Access to  Information.  From the date of this  Agreement  until the

its authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
all of its books and records and, during such period,  the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent such other  information used in the operation of its business
as Parent may reasonably  request and the provision of which is not inconsistent
with  applicable laws or agreements.  Parent and its authorized  representatives
will  conduct  all  such  inspections  in  a  manner  which  will  minimize  any
disruptions of the business and operations of the Company and its  Subsidiaries.
Until the  Effective  Time,  Parent  and  Merger  Subsidiary  will hold any such
information in accordance with the provisions of the  confidentiality  agreement
between  the   Company   and   Parent,   dated  as  of  January  25,  2001  (the

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their respective  Representatives  shall return (and hold  confidential) all
information  provided  pursuant  to this  Section  5.3 and all other  Evaluation
Material  (as  defined  in  the  Confidentiality   Agreement)  pursuant  to  the
procedures set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.4 Further Action;  Best Efforts;  Company Common Stock Purchases.  (a)
Upon the  terms and  subject  to the  conditions  herein  provided,  each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under  applicable  laws and  regulations  to consummate  and make  effective the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  including using best efforts to
satisfy  the  conditions  precedent  to the  obligations  of any of the  parties
hereto, to obtain all necessary  authorizations,  consents and approvals, and to
effect all  necessary  registrations  and  filings,  including  filings with and
approval of the Insurance  Commissioners,  Directors or Superintendents,  as the
case may be, of the  jurisdictions  listed on Section  3.4(b) of the  Disclosure
Schedule.  Each of the parties  hereto will  furnish to the other  parties  such
necessary  information  and  reasonable  assistance  as such other  parties  may
reasonably  request in connection  with the foregoing and will provide the other
parties  with  copies of all  filings  made by such party with any  Governmental
Entity or any other information  supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated  hereby. In
case at any time after the  Effective  Time any further  action is  necessary or
desirable  to carry out the  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the proper  officers
and/or  directors  of the  parties  shall  take or cause  to be  taken  all such
necessary action.

(b) Parent and the Company shall use their  respective  best efforts to make all
necessary  filings,  and thereafter  make any other required  submissions,  with
respect   to  this   Agreement   and  the   Merger   required   under   (i)  the
Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements  Act of 1976,  as  amended  (the "HSR
Act"),  and,  to the extent  applicable,  the laws of any foreign  nations  with
similar  purpose,  and any related  governmental  request  thereunder,  (ii) the
applicable  Insurance  Laws and (iii) any other  applicable  law (provided  that
nothing herein stated shall require the Company to take or cause to be taken any
action,  or to do or  cause to be done  any  things,  which  the  Board,  in the
exercise of its fiduciary duties,  determines,  in good faith after consultation
with its legal advisors,  should not be taken or done). The Company,  Parent and
Merger  Subsidiary shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making
of all such filings,  including  providing  copies of all such  documents to the
non-filing  party and its advisors  prior to filing and, if  requested,  consult
with the non-filing party regarding additions, deletions or changes suggested by
the non-filing party in connection therewith.  Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company shall use their respective best efforts to resolve such  objections,  if
any, as may be asserted  with respect to the  transactions  contemplated  hereby
under the laws,  rules,  guidelines or regulations of any  Governmental  Entity.
Without limiting the foregoing,  the Company and Parent shall file  Notification
and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and  the  Antitrust  Division  of the  Department  of  Justice  (the  "Antitrust
Division") and all other requisite  documents and  notifications  with any other
antitrust  or  cartel  authority  having   jurisdiction  over  the  transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as practicable and shall use best efforts to respond
as  promptly  as  practicable  to all  inquiries  received  from  the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional  information or documentation;  and Parent and
Merger  Subsidiary shall use their best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary,  proper or advisable to obtain any consent,  waiver, approval
or  authorization  relating  to any  Competition  Law that is  required  for the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  which efforts
shall include the proffer by Parent and Merger  Subsidiary of their  willingness
to accept an order providing for the divestiture by Parent and Merger Subsidiary
of such of the assets of the Company (or, in lieu thereof, assets and businesses
of  Parent  or its  Subsidiaries),  as  are  necessary  for  Parent  and  Merger
Subsidiary fully to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
and  an  offer  to  hold  separate  such  assets  and  businesses  pending  such
divestiture.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  "Competition  Laws" shall mean
statutes,  rules,  regulations,  orders,  decrees,  administrative  and judicial
doctrines, and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate  actions having the purpose or effect of  monopolization,  lessening of
competition  or  restraint  of trade and includes the HSR Act and, to the extent
applicable, laws of any foreign nations with similar purpose.

(c)  Parent  and Merger  Subsidiary  will not  purchase  or  otherwise  become a
beneficial  owner  of  any  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock,  any  securities
convertible  into or  exchangeable  for  Company  Common  Stock or any shares of
Company  Preferred Stock without the prior written  consent of the Board,  which
consent  may be given or withheld  for any or no reason,  and each of Parent and
Merger  Subsidiary  agrees  that  any  such  purchase  may be  subject  to  such
conditions and limitations as the Board deems appropriate.

Section 5.5 Shareholders'  Meeting;  Proxy Statement.  (a) The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting") for the
purpose  of  obtaining  the  approval  of this  Agreement  and the  transactions
contemplated hereby by the shareholders of the Company entitled to vote thereon.
The Board will, to the extent  consistent  with its fiduciary  obligations,  (i)
recommend to the  shareholders  of the Company the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the transactions  contemplated  hereby and (ii) use its reasonable
best  efforts to obtain  the  necessary  approvals  by the  shareholders  of the
Company of this  Agreement  and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  At the
Company  Shareholders'  Meeting,  all of the Company  Common Stock then owned by
Parent,  Merger  Subsidiary or any other  subsidiary of Parent shall be voted in
favor of  adoption  of the  Agreement  and to  approve  the Merger  (subject  to
applicable law).

(b) The Company shall prepare,  and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cooperate
with the Company in such preparation,  a Proxy Statement (the "Proxy Statement")
and cause the Proxy  Statement to be mailed to its  shareholders.  Parent agrees
that it will  provide  the Company  with all  information  concerning  Parent or
Merger  Subsidiary  necessary  or  appropriate  to  be  included  in  the  Proxy
Statement. The Company represents and warrants that the Proxy Statement (and any
amendment  thereof  or  supplement  thereto)  at  the  date  mailed  to  Company
shareholders  and at the time of the  Company  Shareholders'  Meeting,  will not
contain any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein,  in  light  of  the  circumstances  under  which  they  are  made,  not
misleading; except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to
statements made in the Proxy  Statement based on information  supplied by Parent
or the Merger  Subsidiary for inclusion in the Proxy  Statement.  Each of Parent
and Merger  Subsidiary  represents  and  warrants  that none of the  information
supplied by Parent or Merger  Subsidiary  for  inclusion in the Proxy  Statement
(including any  amendments or  supplements  thereto) will, at the date mailed to
shareholders and at the time of the Company Shareholders'  Meeting,  contain any
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the statements  therein,  in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Subject to
the fiduciary  obligations of the Board under  applicable law, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board that shareholders
of the Company vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this  Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.6 Voting Agreements;  Proxies. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement,  each  director  of the  Company who holds  Company  Common  Stock is
entering into a Voting  Agreement  ("Voting  Agreement") with Parent pursuant to
which such director  agrees to vote all of his shares of Company Common Stock to
approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement,  and  grants  Parent  an  irrevocable  proxy  to so  vote  such
director's  shares of Company  Common  Stock,  in the form of Exhibit A attached
hereto.

Section 5.7       Employee Benefits.  Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby:

     (i)  agree to assume, honor and maintain without any amendment thereto, and
          cause the Surviving  Corporation to assume, honor and maintain without
          any amendment thereto, for a period of one year immediately  following
          the Effective Time, each Employee Benefit Plan and Employee  Agreement
          identified  in  Section  3.8(a)  of the  Disclosure  Schedule  for the
          benefit of the employees of the Company and its  Subsidiaries,  and to
          make required  payments when due under each such Employee Benefit Plan
          and Employee Agreement;

     (ii) acknowledge  that for  purposes  of the  Employee  Benefit  Plans  and
          Employee  Agreements  identified in Section  3.8(a) of the  Disclosure
          Schedule,  the consummation of the Merger will constitute a "Change in
          Control" of the Company (as that term is defined in each such Employee
          Benefit Plan or Employee Agreement).

Section 5.8 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.
(a) The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation shall
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification  set forth in Article III
of the  Company's  Articles of  Incorporation  and  Article IX of the  Company's
Bylaws on the date of this  Agreement and shall provide for  indemnification  to
the  fullest  extent  permitted  by and in  accordance  with  the  NCBCA,  which
provisions shall not be amended,  repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years  after the  Effective  Time  (provided  that in the event any claim is
asserted or made within such six year period,  all rights to  indemnification in
respect of any such claim shall  continue  until final  disposition  of any such
claim) in any manner  that would  adversely  affect  the  rights  thereunder  of
individuals  who at any time  prior to the  Effective  Time  were  directors  or
officers of the Company in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior
to  the  Effective  Time  (including,   without  limitation,   the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) Each of Parent and Argonaut  Group,  Inc.  agree that at all times after the
Effective  Time it shall,  and shall  cause the  Surviving  Corporation  and its
Subsidiaries to, indemnify each person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof, an employee, agent, director or officer of the Company or of
any of the  Company's  Subsidiaries  (individually  an  "Indemnified  Party" and
collectively  the  "Indemnified  Parties"),  to the  full  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law, with respect to any claim,  liability,  loss,  damage,  cost or
expense,  whenever asserted or claimed, based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, any matter  existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective  Time.  Parent and Argonaut  Group,  Inc.  shall,  and shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation  to, maintain in effect for not less than six years after
the  Effective  Time policies of directors'  and officers'  liability  insurance
equivalent in all material  respects to those  maintained by or on behalf of the
Company  and its  Subsidiaries  on the date hereof (and having at least the same
coverage and containing terms and conditions  which are no less  advantageous to
the persons  currently  covered by such  policies as  insured)  with  respect to
matters  existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; and Parent and
Argonaut Group, Inc., jointly and severally,  in addition to the indemnification
provided above in this Section 5.8, shall indemnify the Indemnified  Parties for
the  balance of such  insurance  coverage  on the same terms and  conditions  as
though Parent were the insurer under those policies.

Section 5.9 Publicity.  Neither the Company,  Parent nor any of their respective
affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or make any
public  statements  with  respect to the  Merger,  this  Agreement  or the other
transactions  contemplated  hereby without the prior  consultation  of the other
party,  except as may be  required  by law or by any  listing  agreement  with a
national  securities  exchange in which case, the party  proposing to issue such
press release or make such public statement shall use all reasonable  efforts to
consult  with the other party before  issuing such press  release or making such
public statement.

a party whose failure to fulfill any  obligation  under this  Agreement has been
the cause of or  resulted in the  failure of the  Effective  Time to occur on or
before such date);  or (ii) if the  shareholders  of the Company fail to approve
and adopt this  Agreement at the Company  Shareholders'  Meeting  (including any

have materially breached this Agreement;  or (iii) the Board of Directors of the
Company  shall have  withdrawn  or  modified  in a manner  adverse to Parent its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2(a); or (iv)
any Governmental Entity shall have issued a statute, order, decree or regulation
or taken any other action (which  statute,  order,  decree,  regulation or other
action the parties  hereto shall have used their best efforts to lift),  in each
case permanently  restraining,  enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or
making the Merger illegal and such statute,  order, decree,  regulation or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable;

(c) by the  Company in order to execute a  definitive  agreement  relating to an
Acquisition Proposal which is a Superior Proposal;

(d) by the Company upon a breach of any representation or warranty or material
covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of the Parent shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) and Section
6.2(b) would not be satisfied (a "Terminating Parent Breach"); provided,
however, that, if such Terminating Parent Breach is curable by the Parent prior
to the Closing Date through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts
and for so long as the Parent continues to exercise such commercially reasonable
efforts, the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d)
prior to the Termination Date; or

(e) by the Parent  upon a breach of any  representation  or warranty or material
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or
if any  representation  or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue,  in
either  case such that the  conditions  set forth in  Section  6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b)  would not be  satisfied  (a  "Terminating  Company  Breach");  provided,
however,  that,  if such  Terminating  Company  Breach is curable by the Company
prior to the Closing Date through the  exercise of its  commercially  reasonable
efforts and for so long as the Company  continues to exercise such  commercially
reasonable  efforts,  the Parent may not  terminate  this  Agreement  under this
Section 7.1(e) prior to the Termination Date.

Section  7.2  Effect of  Termination.  In the event of the  termination  of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1,  written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to the other party or parties  specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such  termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith  become null
and  void,  and  there  shall  be no  liability  on the part of  Parent,  Merger
Subsidiary or the Company except (a) to the extent such termination results from
the material  breach by a party of any of its  representations  and  warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, (b) as set forth in Section
7.3 hereof and (c) with respect to compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement
and the  obligation  to  return  or hold  Evaluation  Material  pursuant  to the
procedures set forth therein and in Section 5.3.

Section 7.3 Fees and  Expenses.  (a) Except as  otherwise  contemplated  by this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the  consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses.

(b)      If this Agreement is terminated:

(i)      by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or 7.1(b)(iii) and at the time
         of the termination a third party shall have made, and not revoked, a
         bona fide Acquisition Proposal which is a Superior Proposal and such
         Acquisition Proposal is consummated prior to the first anniversary of
         such termination; or

(ii)     by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) or 7.1(c)

then in any such case  described in clauses (i) or (ii),  provided  that each of
Parent  and  Merger   Subsidiary   is  not  then  in  material   breach  of  any
representation,  warranty,  covenant  or  other  agreement  pertaining  to  them
contained  herein  (after having been notified by the Company of such breach and
given at least a 30 day opportunity to cure the same),  the Company shall pay to
Parent  liquidated  damages in an amount equal to  $4,950,000  (the  "Liquidated
Damage Amount"). Upon payment by the Company of the Liquidated Damage Amount the
Company shall be fully released and discharged  from any liability or obligation
resulting from or under this Agreement.

(c) In no event shall more than one  Liquidated  Damage  Amount be payable under
this Section 7.3.

(d) All payments made pursuant to Section  7.3(b) shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately  available funds to an account designated by Parent. In the event
of  a  termination  of  this  Agreement  by  the  Company  pursuant  to  Section
7.1(b)(iii) or 7.1(c),  such amount shall be paid no later than one business day
following such  termination.  In the event of a termination of this Agreement by
Parent  pursuant  to  Section  7.1(b)(ii)  or  7.1(b)(iii),  pursuant  to  which
Liquidated Damages became payable under Section 7.3(b)(i),  such amount shall be
paid prior to the consummation of the relevant Acquisition Proposal.

(e) If this  Agreement is  terminated  by the Company or the Parent  pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) or 7.1(e),  as the case may be, then the party  terminating  this
Agreement  shall be  entitled  to an amount  equal to  $4,950,000  (the  "Breach
Amount").  Upon payment of the Breach Amount,  the Parent,  Merger Subsidiary or
the Company, as the case may be, shall be fully released and discharged from any
liability or obligation resulting from or under this Agreement.

(f)  This  Section  7.3  shall  survive  any   termination   of  this  Agreement
indefinitely.

ARTICLE VIII.     HOLDBACK

Section  8.1  Merger  Consideration  Holdback.  In  order  to  ensure  that  the
representations,  warranties  and  covenants  made  by the  Company  under  this
Agreement  are not breached  and in order to provide for an exclusive  source of
recovery by Argonaut Group,  Inc.,  Parent and the Surviving  Corporation in the
event of such a breach,  the Company  agrees that  $8,000,000  (the  "Holdback")
shall be deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account (the Holdback, together
with any additional monies received by the Escrow Agent, as hereinafter defined,
for  inclusion  in such  account and any interest  earned  thereon,  the "Escrow
Fund")   pursuant  to  the  terms  and   conditions  of  an  Escrow   Agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"), dated as
of the Closing Date, among the Shareholder Representatives, Parent and an escrow
agent mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent (the "Escrow Agent").  If the
parties do not mutually agree otherwise,  the Escrow Agent shall be Harris Bank.
The Holdback  shall be deposited  with the Escrow  Agent  concurrently  with the
payment of the Payment Fund (less the Holdback) to the Paying Agent  pursuant to
Section  2.2.  The  Escrow  Fund shall be  invested  as  provided  in the Escrow
Agreement,  and the  Escrow  Fund  shall not be used for any  purpose  except as
expressly provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

Section 8.2 Recoverable  Amounts.  (a) Subject to the provisions hereof,  Parent
and Surviving  Corporation shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund any
liability,  loss,  damage,  cost or other  expense  incurred,  or required to be
recognized, by Argonaut Group, Inc., Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Recoverable Amounts") arising out of any breach
by the  Company of any  representation,  warranty or covenant of the Company set
forth in this Agreement,  provided that none of Argonaut Group,  Inc., Parent or
Surviving  Corporation  shall be  entitled  to be paid any  amounts  under  this
Section 8.2 other than on account of  Qualifying  Claims.  For  purposes of this
Agreement,  a "Qualifying  Claim" shall mean (i) a claim for recovery out of the
Escrow  Fund,  (ii)  arising  out of or as a result  of a single  breach  by the
Company of a representation,  warranty or covenant, (iii) submitted prior to the
first  anniversary  of the Closing  Date and (iv) which  results in  Recoverable
Amounts in excess of $3,000,000.  Subject to the provisions  hereof,  the Escrow
Agent shall only be obligated to pay, and Argonaut Group,  Inc.,  Parent and the
Surviving  Corporation shall only be entitled to recover, (1) the full amount of
each  Qualifying  Claim,  net  of  Claims  Recoveries  (as  defined  in  Section
8.2(d)(iv))  actually  received  by any of them (and not  merely  recognized  in
accordance with GAAP or any other applicable reporting  requirement) at the time
such Qualifying Claim is otherwise payable hereunder, and (2) such net amount to
the extent that any liability,  loss, damage,  cost or other expense is actually
incurred  (and not  merely  recognized  in  accordance  with  GAAP or any  other
applicable reporting requirement) by Argonaut Group, Inc., Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its  Subsidiaries,  as the case may be. The parties hereto
acknowledge  that even if a claim at any time  qualifies as a  Qualifying  Claim
hereunder (and even if the  Shareholder  Representatives  have conceded the same
for purposes of Section  8.2(f)),  no payment from the Escrow Fund shall be made
in respect of such Qualifying Claim unless,  at the time payment is otherwise to
be made  hereunder,  the amount to be paid on account of such  Qualifying  Claim
(without  considering  Claim  Recoveries) in fact exceeds  $3,000,000.  As among
Argonaut  Insurance  Company,  Argonaut Midwest  Insurance Company and Surviving
Corporation,  the Escrow Agent shall allocate payments otherwise payable to them
hereunder in such proportion as they, in their discretion, shall direct.

(b) In order to assert a claim under this  Section  8.2,  as soon as  reasonably
possible  after Parent  obtains  knowledge of a claim but in any event not later
than the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall give written notice
(a "Claim  Notice") to the  Shareholder  Representatives  appointed  pursuant to
Section 8.4, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, of such claim,  which Claim Notice
shall  set forth the facts and  circumstances  giving  rise to such  claim,  the
amount of Recoverable  Amounts asserted with respect thereto,  and the basis for
concluding that such claim is a Qualifying  Claim. Upon and after becoming aware
of any  event  which  could  reasonably  be  expected  to give rise to any claim
hereunder,  Parent and the Surviving  Corporation  shall  diligently  pursue all
commercially   reasonable  alternative  sources  of  recovery  for  such  claim,
including but not limited to any applicable insurance policies, indemnifications
or any other  third  party  arrangements  which  would  offset  or  recoup  such
Recoverable Amounts.

(c)  Promptly  following  delivery of any Claim  Notice with respect to a claim,
Parent  and  the  Shareholder   Representatives  shall  act  in  good  faith  as
expeditiously  as  possible to resolve  such  claim.  In the event that any such
claim is not  resolved  by such  parties  within 30 days after  delivery of such
Claim  Notice,  such  claim  may,  at the  instance  of either  the  Shareholder
Representatives or Parent, be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the provisions
of  Section  9.10.  In  the  event  of any  such  arbitration,  the  Shareholder
Representatives  and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to record an amount of
the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of such disputed  claim as a sub-account  of
the Escrow Fund (a "Claims Reserve") until resolution of such claim. If multiple
claims are disputed, the Shareholder Representatives and Parent shall direct the
Escrow Agent to so record a sub-account for each individual claim, each with the
appropriate Claims Reserve. The parties hereto acknowledge that aggregate Claims
Reserves may exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund. Such Claims Reserves shall be
released as follows:

(i) If any  such  arbitration  results  in a  determination,  finding,  order or
judgment of the arbitrators  that the claim submitted is a Qualifying  Claim, or
the parties  thereto  otherwise  settle  such  dispute in favor of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation,  Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to that amount of the  associated  Claims Reserve equal to (1)
the amount awarded by the arbitrators,  or such amount mutually agreed to by the
parties thereto, as the case may be, plus (2) the amount of all reasonable legal
fees and expenses incurred by Parent or the Surviving  Corporation,  as the case
may be, in  connection  with such  arbitration  or such lesser  amount as may be
determined  by the  arbitrators  pursuant to Section 9.10 or otherwise  mutually
agreed by the parties  hereto,  which fees and  expenses  shall be paid from the
Escrow Fund as a whole (such amounts in clauses (1) and (2),  together,  "Claims
Payments")  plus (3) the  earnings  on that  portion  of the  associated  Claims
Reserve that is so awarded or agreed upon pursuant to clause (1) above.

(ii) If any such arbitration does not result in a determination,  finding, order
or judgment of the arbitrators  that the claim  submitted is a Qualifying  Claim
and such  arbitration  is concluded on or prior to the first  anniversary of the
Closing Date, the associated Claims Reserve, together with any earnings thereon,
shall be released  from the  associated  sub-account  and returned to the Escrow
Fund and be available for inclusion in any Claims Reserves  thereafter  recorded
and/or for  distribution  to the Paying Agent or as  otherwise  provided in this
Agreement.  In addition, in any such case, Parent or the Surviving  Corporation,
as the case may be, shall  reimburse  the Escrow Fund for all  reasonable  legal
fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representatives in connection with
such  arbitration or such lesser amount as may be determined by the  arbitrators
pursuant to Section 9.10.

(iii) If any such arbitration does not result in a determination, finding, order
or judgment of the arbitrators  that the claim  submitted is a Qualifying  Claim
and such  arbitration  is concluded  after the first  anniversary of the Closing
Date, such portion of the associated Claims Reserve,  together with any earnings
thereon,  shall be released  (1) to the Escrow  Agent in an amount  equal to the
aggregate amount by which any remaining Claims Reserves exceed the amount of the
Escrow  Fund,  and (2) to the  Paying  Agent in an  amount  equal to the  excess
thereof, which amount shall be distributed pursuant to Section 2.2. In addition,
in any  such  case of a  release  of fund to the  Paying  Agent,  Parent  or the
Surviving  Corporation,  as the case may be,  shall pay to the Paying  Agent for
distribution  pursuant to Section 2.2, an amount equal to all  reasonable  legal
fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representatives in connection with
such arbitration,  or such lesser amount as may be determined by the arbitrators
pursuant to Section 9.10, plus the Yield Shortfall (as hereinafter  defined), if
any.
(d)      For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
         following meanings:

(i)      "Guaranteed Yield" shall mean, with respect to each Escrow Release,
         interest accrued thereon at a rate of 8% per annum, calculated from the
         Closing Date to and including the date of such Escrow Release.

(ii)     "Yield Shortfall" shall mean, with respect to each Escrow Release, that
         amount by which the Guaranteed Yield exceeds the amount of interest
         actually earned on such Escrow Release, calculated from the Closing
         Date to and including the date of such Escrow Release.

(iii)    "Escrow Release" shall mean any release by the Escrow Agent to the
         Paying Agent out of the Escrow Fund including, without limitation,
         Claims Reserves or Claims Recoveries, but shall not include any legal
         fees and expenses paid from the Escrow Fund to the Shareholder
         Representatives pursuant to Section 8.4.

(iv)     "Claims Recoveries" shall mean the total amount of any insurance,
         indemnity and any other offset or recovery actually received by Parent
         or the Surviving Corporation for any claim or Qualifying Claim
         excluding any Claims Payments.

(e)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the  contrary,  in the event Parent or
Surviving  Corporation  receives  Claims  Recoveries,  (i)  prior  to the  first
anniversary of the Closing Date, then promptly after receipt thereof,  Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay to the Escrow Agent for
deposit in the Escrow Fund an amount equal to such Claims  Recoveries,  provided
that in the event that such payment is not made to the Escrow Agent,  the amount
of any Claims  Payments  thereafter  made by the  Escrow  Agent to Parent or the
Surviving  Corporation,  as the case may be, shall be reduced by an amount equal
to  such  Claims  Recoveries  not so  paid,  and  (ii)  on or  after  the  first
anniversary  of the  Closing  Date and prior to the  fourth  anniversary  of the
earliest date on which the balance in the Escrow Fund equals zero, then promptly
after receipt thereof, Parent or the Surviving Corporation,  as the case may be,
shall pay to the Paying  Agent for  distribution  pursuant  to Section  2.2,  an
amount equal to such Claims Recoveries.

(f) Upon  delivery of a Claim Notice  asserting a Qualifying  Claim based upon a
claim made by third  parties  against the  Surviving  Corporation  or any of the
Subsidiaries:

(i)  If the  balance  of the  Escrow  Fund  (exclusive  of any  amount in Claims
     Reserves for unrelated  disputed  claims) is less than 60% of the amount of
     the Recoverable Amount that is the subject of such Claim Notice, the Parent
     or  Surviving  Corporation,  as the case may be,  shall  have the  right to
     defend  against  such  claim   (including  the  selection  of  counsel  and
     settlement of the claim), provided Parent or the Surviving Corporation,  as
     the case may be,  shall  keep the  Shareholder  Representatives  fully  and
     completely  informed  of the  status  of the  claim  at all  stages  of the
     proceedings   thereof,   and   further   provided   that  the   Shareholder
     Representatives  may elect to revoke such  authority to defend against such
     claim at any time that it reasonably appears that the balance in the Escrow
     Fund  (exclusive of any amount in Claims  Reserves for  unrelated  disputed
     claims) is equal to not less than 60% of such Recoverable Amount.

(ii) If (1) the  balance of the Escrow Fund  (exclusive  of any amount in Claims
     Reserves for unrelated  disputed claims) is equal to or greater than 60% of
     the  amount of the  Recoverable  Amount  that is the  subject of such Claim
     Notice, and (2) the Shareholders  Representatives have irrevocably conceded
     in  writing  that  the  third  party  claim  is  a  Qualifying  Claim,  the
     Shareholder  Representatives  may elect to direct the defense of such claim
     (including the selection of counsel and settlement of the claim),  provided
     the  Shareholder  Representatives  shall  keep  Parent  and  the  Surviving
     Corporation fully and completely informed of the status of the claim at all
     stages of the proceedings  thereof, and further provided that Parent or the
     Surviving  Corporation may elect to revoke such authority to defend against
     such claim at any time that it  reasonably  appears that the balance in the
     Escrow  Fund  (exclusive  of any amount in Claims  Reserves  for  unrelated
     disputed claims) is less than 60% of such Recoverable Amount.

(iii)Notwithstanding  anything in the foregoing to the contrary,  if at any time
     the balance of the Escrow Fund  (including all amounts in Claims  Reserves)
     is less than 60% of the aggregate of all  Recoverable  Amounts for all then
     pending   Claim   Notices,   by   written   notice   to   the   Shareholder
     Representatives,   Parent  and   Surviving   Corporation,   in  their  sole
     discretion,   may  elect  to  revoke  any  authority  of  the   Shareholder
     Representatives to defend any or all such claims of third parties and shall
     have the right to manage the defense of any claims thereafter arising.

In the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above,  any counsel so retained by Parent or
Surviving  or by the  Shareholder  Representatives,  as the case  may be,  shall
acknowledge in writing to the other party hereto the limitation on the authority
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or of the Shareholder Representatives, as
the case may be, under this Section 8.2(f).

(g)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  the  parties  hereto
acknowledge and agree that a Qualifying Claim otherwise payable to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be paid to the extent of the Escrow Fund even if any
associated Claims Reserve is less than the amount thereof.

Section  8.3  Release of Escrow  Fund.  (a) In the event that on or prior to the
first  anniversary  of the Closing Date, no Claim Notice has been given pursuant
to the terms and  conditions  of Section 8.2, then on first  anniversary  of the
Closing  Date,  or as soon as possible  thereafter,  (i) the Escrow  Agent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent the Escrow Fund  (including,  any interest earned on
such monies  deposited  therein)  and (ii) Parent or the  Surviving  Corporation
shall deliver to the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Yield Shortfall.

(b) In the event that on or prior to the first  anniversary of the Closing Date,
one or more Claim Notices have been given  pursuant to the terms and  conditions
of Section 8.2, then on the day after the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
or as soon as possible  thereafter,  and from time to time  thereafter,  (i) the
Escrow Agent shall  deliver to the Paying Agent the Escrow Fund to the extent it
exceeds  the  Claims  Reserves  that are then in  existence  (or  which  will be
established as a result of a Claim Notice upon the direction of the  Shareholder
Representatives  and Parent),  including,  any interest earned on such monies so
delivered,  and (ii) concurrently with such delivery to the Paying Agent, Parent
or the Surviving  Corporation  shall deliver to the Paying Agent an amount equal
to the Yield Shortfall with respect to such Escrow Release.

(c) The parties hereto further  acknowledge and agree that the aggregate  amount
of all Yield Shortfall payments under this Article VIII shall in no event exceed
an amount equal to the  difference  between (i) 8% per annum with respect to the
particular  Escrow Release,  and (ii) the amount of interest  actually earned on
the aggregate  balance of the Escrow Fund,  calculated  from the Closing Date to
and including the date the balance in the Escrow Fund equals zero.

(d) Any monies released from the Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent pursuant hereto
and the Escrow Agreement shall be distributed by the Paying Agent to the Holders
in  the  same  manner  as  the  balance  of  the  Initial  Common  Stock  Merger
Consideration and the Initial Preferred Stock Merger Consideration.

Section 8.4 Shareholder Representatives. Upon the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger by the  requisite  vote of the holders of the Company  Common  Stock,
each of  Richard  Wright,  J. Adam  Abram  and Alan  Colner  (collectively,  the
"Shareholder Representatives" and each, a "Shareholder Representative") shall be
irrevocably appointed to act as the representatives for the Holders with respect
to all post-Closing  matters requiring any action or decision by the Shareholder
Representatives   as   provided   in  this   Article   VIII.   The   Shareholder
Representatives  are hereby authorized to take any and all such actions and make
any  decisions  necessary  or desirable in  connection  with the defense  and/or
settlement  of any  claims  and the  Escrow  Agreement.  In  furtherance  of the
foregoing,  the Shareholder  Representatives may by written notice to the Escrow
Agent,  with a copy to Parent,  request payment for or  reimbursement of any and
all reasonable legal fees and expenses paid or payable by any of the Shareholder
Representatives in connection with any post-Closing matters requiring any action
by the Shareholder  Representatives  as provided in this Article VIII including,
without  limitation,  the defense and/or settlement of any claims and the Escrow
Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to release from time to time
from the Escrow  Fund an amount  equal to such fees and  expenses  so  requested
unless,  within ten days after such notice the Parent objects to such payment by
delivery of notice to the Shareholder  Representatives  and the Escrow Agent, in
which case such fees and  expenses  will not be disbursed  absent (1)  agreement
between the Shareholder  Representatives and the Parent or (2) a judgment of the
arbitrators  in  connection  with the  resolution  of a claim that such fees are
reasonable and are not required to be reimbursed by Parent.  Amounts so released
for such fees and  expenses  will in no event be taken into account for purposes
of any determination of the Yield Shortfall.  Any notice or other  communication
to be delivered to the Shareholder Representatives shall be delivered to each of
them pursuant to Section 9.3 and any notice or other  communication to be signed
by the Shareholder  Representatives  shall be valid and binding if signed by any
two Shareholder  Representatives.  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on such  appointment and treat the Shareholder  Representatives
as the  duly  appointed  representatives  for the  Holders.  If any  Shareholder
Representative   shall  be   unable   to  serve,   the   remaining   Shareholder
Representatives  shall appoint a replacement  therefor,  and if at any time only
one  Shareholder   Representative   is  then  serving,   then  such  Shareholder
Representative  is  authorized  to act alone  pursuant to this Section 8.4. Each
Shareholder  Representative,  by execution hereof, confirms such appointment and
authority and acknowledges  and agrees that such appointment is irrevocable,  it
being  understood that the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement is
based,  in  part,  on  the  appointment  of a  representative  to act  for  such
post-Closing  matters.  In  acting as the  representative  of the  Holders,  the
Shareholder Representatives may rely upon, and shall not be liable to any Holder
for acting or refraining from acting upon, an opinion of counsel, certificate of
auditors or other certificates,  statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request,  consent,  order,  arbitrator's award,  appraisal,  bond other paper or
document  reasonably  believed  by him to be genuine  and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.  No Shareholder  Representative  shall
incur any  liability  to any Holder with respect to any action taken or suffered
by him in his capacity as Shareholder  Representative in reliance upon any note,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed by him to
be genuinely and duly  authorized.  In addition,  no Shareholder  Representative
shall incur any  liability  to any Holder for any action or inaction  except his
own fraud or willful misconduct. Each Shareholder Representative may perform his
duties as  Shareholder  Representatives  either  directly  or by or through  his
agents or attorneys and no  Shareholder  Representative  shall be responsible to
any other Holder for any  misconduct  or  negligence on the part of any agent or
attorney  appointed with  reasonable  care by him hereunder or for any action or
inaction by any other Shareholder  Representative.  The parties acknowledge that
any liability,  loss, damage,  cost or other expense incurred by Argonaut Group,
Inc.,  Parent or the  Surviving  Corporation  as a result of a claim by a Holder
against  Argonaut  Group,  Inc.,  Parent or the  Surviving  Corporation  seeking
damages as a result of or arising out of any act or omission of the  Shareholder
Representatives  under  this  Agreement  in their  capacities  as such  shall be
Recoverable Amounts under this Article VIII.

ARTICLE IX.       MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 Amendment;  Waiver. (a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto,  by action taken or authorized by their respective  Boards of Directors,
at any time before or after approval by the  shareholders  of the Company of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger,  but after any such approval no
amendment  shall be made  without  the  approval  of such  shareholders  if such
amendment changes the amount or form of the Common Stock Merger Consideration or
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration or alters or changes any of the other terms
or conditions of this  Agreement if such  alteration or change would  materially
adversely  affect the rights of such  shareholders.  This  Agreement  may not be
amended  except  by an  instrument  in  writing  signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other  parties  contained  herein or in any  document,  certificate  or  writing
delivered  pursuant hereto or (iii) waive  compliance with any of the agreements
or  conditions  of the other parties  hereto  contained  herein other than terms
which  could not be amended  without  shareholder  approval  pursuant to Section
9.1(a).  Any agreement on the part of any party to any such  extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such  party.  The  failure of any party to this  Agreement  to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 9.2 Survival.  Subject to Article VIII, the  respective  representations
and warranties of Parent,  Merger Subsidiary and the Company contained herein or

Time shall not survive beyond the Effective  Time.  Subject to Article VIII, the

Sections,  such  reference  shall  be to a  Section  of  this  Agreement  unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are

available  if  requested  by the  party to whom such  information  is to be made

any Section of the  Disclosure  Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for all
purposes under this Agreement but such  disclosure  shall not be deemed to be an
admission or representation as to the materiality of the item so disclosed.

Section  9.6  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in  two or  more
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original  but all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement.

Section 9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement,  together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements
and  understandings  (written  and oral),  among the parties with respect to the
subject   matter   hereof   and   there  are  no   agreements,   understandings,
representations  or  warranties  among the parties other than those set forth or
referred to herein.

Section  9.8  Severability.  In the  event  that  this  Agreement  or any  other
instrument  referred to herein,  or any of their respective  provisions,  or the
performance  of  any  such  provision,  is  found  to  be  invalid,  illegal  or
unenforceable under applicable law now or hereafter in effect, the parties shall
be excused from  performance  of such  proportions of this Agreement as shall be
found to be  invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable  under the  applicable  laws or
regulations  without,  to the maximum  extent  permitted by law,  affecting  the
validity of the  remaining  provisions  of the  Agreement.  Should any method of
termination  of this  Agreement  or a portion  thereof  be found to be  invalid,
illegal or  unenforceable,  such  method  shall be  reformed  to comply with the
requirements of applicable law so as, to the greatest extent possible,  to allow
termination by that method. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of any
party's right to challenge the validity of such law.  Section 9.9 Governing Law.
This  Agreement  shall be governed and construed in accordance  with the laws of
the State of North Carolina without giving effect to the principles of conflicts
of law thereof.

Section 9.10 Arbitration;  Enforcement.  In the event of any dispute between the
parties with respect to any matter set forth herein,  either Parent,  on the one
hand, or the Company (or, after the Closing, the Shareholder  Representatives in
the event of a dispute under Section 2.9 or under  Article  VIII),  on the other
hand,  may demand  that the dispute be  submitted  to binding  arbitration.  The
demand for  arbitration  by any party (the  "Demanding  Party")  shall (i) be in
writing,  (ii) be served on the other party (the  "Non-Demanding  Party") in the
manner  prescribed  in Section 9.3 for giving  notices,  and (iii) set forth the
matter or matters to be arbitrated and the name of the arbitrator  chosen by the
Demanding Party.  Within fifteen Business Days after receipt of such demand, the
Non-Demanding  Party shall choose an arbitrator  and provide  written  notice of
such selection to the Demanding  Party and shall specify the name and address of
such arbitrator.  If the Non-Demanding  Party shall fail to choose an arbitrator
and  notify the  Demanding  Party as herein  provided  within  such  fifteen-day
period,  the  Demanding  Party  shall  have the  right to apply to the  American
Arbitration  Association  (the  "AAA")  located  in New  York,  New  York for an
appointment of an arbitrator.  The two  arbitrators so chosen as set forth above
shall  promptly  appoint a third  arbitrator as soon as  practicable,  provided,
however,  if they do not do so within twenty Business Days after notice is given
to the parties of the  appointment  of the second  arbitrator,  either Party may
apply to the AAA for the  appointment of the third  arbitrator.  Any arbitration
pursuant hereto shall be in accordance with the Commercial  Arbitration Rules of
the AAA as then in effect,  except to the extent that such rules are in conflict
with the provisions of this Section 9.10;  provided,  however, if the AAA is not
then functioning or such rules are not then in effect,  arbitration  proceedings
shall  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the   requirements  of  the  Uniform
Arbitration Act. All such arbitration  proceedings shall take place in New York,
New York.  The  arbitrators  shall meet as soon as  practicable  after the third
arbitrator  is  appointed.  Both  the  foregoing  agreement  of the  parties  to
arbitrate any and all claims, and the results, determination,  finding, judgment
and/or award rendered pursuant to such  arbitration,  shall be final and binding
on the parties hereto and may be specifically  enforced by legal  proceedings in
any  court  having  jurisdiction  over  such  action.  The  parties  agree  that
irreparable  damage would occur in the event that any of the  provisions of this
Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific  terms or were
otherwise  breached.  It is  accordingly  agreed that the  arbitrators  shall be
authorized  to issue an injunction or  injunctions  to prevent  breaches of this
Agreement  and  to  enforce  specifically  the  terms  and  provisions  of  this
Agreement,  and any such injunction  issued by the arbitrators may be entered in
any court having  jurisdiction.  The  arbitrators  are also  authorized to award
legal fees and costs.

Section  9.11  Liability.   Argonaut  Insurance  Company  and  Argonaut  Midwest
Insurance  Company agree that their  obligations  under this Agreement  shall be
joint and several.

Section 9.12 Assignment;  No Third Party  Beneficiaries.  Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights,  interests or obligations  hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties.  Subject to the preceding  sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon,  inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by, the parties  and their  respective  successors  and  assigns.  Except to the
extent necessary to enforce the provisions of Sections 2.3, 5.5 and 5.7, nothing
in this Agreement  (whether expressed or implied) is intended to confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto and their respective  permitted  successors
and assigns,  any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement nor is
anything in this Agreement intended to relieve or discharge the liability of any
party  hereto,  nor shall any  provision  hereof  give any  person  any right of
subrogation against, or action over against any party.

1934, as amended) by you and any other shares of FRINC Common Stock as to which
you may hereafter acquire beneficial ownership (collectively, the "Shares").

         The Shares owned as of the date hereof are listed on Schedule 1 hereto.
In order to induce Argonaut Insurance Company, a California corporation,
Argonaut Midwest Insurance Company, an Illinois corporation (together, "Buyer")
and its affiliates, to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
May 7, 2001, by and among the Buyer, Argonaut Acquisition Corp. and the Company
(the "Merger Agreement"), you hereby agree as follows:

         1. You hereby represent and warrant as to the Shares that (i) you are
the sole owner of and/or have full right, power and authority to vote the
Shares, and this letter agreement is a valid and binding agreement, enforceable
against you, in accordance with its terms, and (ii) neither the execution of
this letter agreement nor the consummation by you of the transactions
contemplated hereby will constitute a violation of, or conflict with, or default
under, any contract, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or
restriction of any kind to which you are a party or by which you or the Shares
are bound. You further confirm that you are a member in good standing of the
board of directors of the Company.

         2. You hereby agree not to sell, transfer or encumber the Shares prior
to the later of (i) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms and (ii) the date on which this letter agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.

         3. You agree to vote or cause to be voted all of the Shares (i) in
favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and
(ii) against any other mergers, recapitalizations, business combinations, sales
of assets, liquidations or similar transactions involving the Company, or any
other matters which would be inconsistent with the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby. In furtherance of your voting agreement in
this paragraph, you hereby revoke any and all previous proxies with respect to
any of the Shares and grant to Buyer and such individuals or corporations as
Buyer may designate an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the Shares owned by you
in accordance with this paragraph on any matters which may be presented to
shareholders of the Company with respect to any matters related to the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, the Merger or any other
mergers, recapitalizations, business combinations, sales of assets, liquidations
or similar transactions involving the Company, or any other matters which would
be inconsistent with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby or the Merger. You hereby acknowledge that the proxy granted by the
foregoing is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. In addition, you
hereby agree to execute such additional documents as Buyer may reasonably
request to effectuate its proxy and voting rights under this paragraph.

         4. We each hereby agree that this letter agreement creates legally
binding commitments, enforceable in accordance with their terms. This letter
agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the matter hereof and (ii) supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This letter agreement is not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

         5. This letter agreement may be terminated (i) at any time by mutual
written consent of the parties hereto or (ii) by either party on or after the
date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms;
provided, however, that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(ii), 7.1(b)(iii) or 7.1(c) of the Merger Agreement, it shall be a
condition precedent to your right to terminate this letter agreement that you
pay to Buyer an amount (the "Spread") equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares and (y) the difference between the Offer Price (as defined below) and
Common Stock Merger Consideration as applied to the Shares. No termination of
this letter agreement shall relieve either party from liability for any breach
of this letter agreement. You acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
paragraph 5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this letter
agreement and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, if you fail to pay promptly the Spread due
pursuant to this paragraph 5 and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer
commences a suit that results in a judgment against you for the Spread, you
shall pay to Buyer (in addition to the Spread) all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors, actuaries and accountants) incurred by Buyer in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Spread at the prime rate of
Citibank N.A. in effect on the date that such payment was required to be made.
For purposes of this paragraph 5, the term "Offer Price" shall mean the price
per share of FRINC Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

         6. You acknowledge that irreparable damage to Buyer would occur in the
event that you do not perform any provision of this letter agreement in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breach this letter agreement.
You agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of any
covenant or obligation contained in this letter agreement, Buyer shall be
entitled to seek and obtain (i) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach. You further agree that Buyer shall
not be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
paragraph 6, and you hereby irrecoverably waive any right that you may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

         7. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of
New York. Each of the parties shall pay its own expenses in connection with the
execution and performance of this letter agreement.

         8. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this letter
agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this letter agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and there shall be deemed
substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable provision
as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

(such amount, together with any additional monies received by the Escrow Agent
and any interest earned thereon, the "Escrow Fund").

                  C. The  Escrow  Agent is  willing  to act as  escrow  agent
pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement with respect to the Escrow Fund.

the associated Qualifying Claims as set forth therein.

                  5. Liability of Escrow Agent. It is agreed that the duties and
obligations of the Escrow Agent are only such as are herein specifically
provided and no other. The Escrow Agent's duties are as a depositary only, and
the Escrow Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever, except for its willful
misconduct or gross negligence. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its
choice, and shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it
in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Escrow Agent shall not be
bound in any way by any other terms of any other agreement to which Parent and
the Shareholder Representatives are parties, whether or not the Escrow Agent has
knowledge thereof, and the Escrow Agent shall not in any way be required to
determine whether or not any other agreement has been complied with by
Shareholder Representatives or Parent or any other party thereto. The Escrow
Agent shall not be bound by any modification, amendment, termination,
cancellation, rescission or supersession of this Escrow Agreement unless the
same shall be in writing and signed jointly by Shareholder Representatives and
Parent and agreed to by the Escrow Agent. In the event that the Escrow Agent
shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive
instructions, claims or demands which, in its opinion, are in conflict with any
of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from
taking any action other than to keep safely, all property held in escrow until
it shall jointly be directed otherwise in writing by the Shareholder
Representatives and Parent or by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

                   6.      Full Protection.  The Escrow Agent is fully protected
 in relying upon any written notice, demand, certificate or document which it,
in good faith, believes to be genuine.

                   7.      No Legal Proceedings.  The Escrow Agent shall not be
required to institute legal proceedings of any kind and shall not be required to
defend any legal proceedings which may be instituted against it.



<PAGE>


                   8. Deposit Into Court. If the Escrow Agent at any time, in
its sole discretion, deems it necessary or advisable to relinquish custody of
the Escrow Fund, it may do so by delivering the same to any other escrow agent
mutually agreeable to the Shareholder Representatives and Parent and if no such
escrow agent shall be selected, then the Escrow Agent may do so by delivering
the Escrow Fund (a) to any bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan,
City and State of New York, which is willing to act as escrow agent thereunder
in place and instead of the Escrow Agent or (b) to the clerk or other proper
officer of a court of competent jurisdiction as may be permitted by law within
the State, County and City of New York. The fee of any such bank or trust
company or court officer shall be borne jointly and severally by the Shareholder
Representatives, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. Upon such
delivery, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any and all further
responsibility or liability with respect to the Escrow Fund except as herein
provided.

                   9. No Fiduciary Duty. The Escrow Agreement shall not create
any fiduciary duty on the Escrow Agent's part to the Shareholder Representatives
or Parent or any of their respective affiliates, nor disqualify the Escrow Agent
from representing the Shareholder Representatives or any of their affiliates in
any dispute with Parent or any of its affiliates including, without limitation,
any dispute with respect to the Merger Agreement.

                   10. Expenses. The out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by
the Escrow Agent in the administration of its duties hereunder, including, but
not limited to, all counsel and advisors' and agents' fees including, without
limitation, counsel fees under paragraph 5 hereof, and all taxes or other
governmental charges, if any, shall be paid jointly and severally from the
Escrow Fund and by Parent. Each of Parent and the Shareholder Representatives
hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Fund an amount equal to any and all such out-of-pocket expenses and taxes
or other governmental charges.

                  11. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. Parent hereby indemnifies
and holds the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any and all loss, damage,
tax, liability and expense that may be incurred by the Escrow Agent, arising out
of or in connection with its acceptance of appointment as the Escrow Agent
hereunder, or the performance of its duties pursuant to this Escrow Agreement,
including all legal costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent defending itself
against any claim or liability in connection with its performance hereunder;
provided that each of Parent and the Shareholder Representatives hereby
authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund
an amount equal to any and all such loss, damage, tax, liability and expense.

                  12. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing, with copies to all the other
parties hereto, and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when delivered,
