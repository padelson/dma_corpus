ARTICLE 1

 

PLAN OF CONVERSION

 

 

1.1 PICA Plan of Conversion. PICA has adopted the Plan of
Conversion, substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto. PICA
shall file the Plan of Conversion with the Director ("Director") of the
Illinois Division of Insurance (the "Division") in accordance with 215 ILCS
5/59.1 (Conversion to a stock company) of the Illinois Insurance Code ("215
ILCS 5/59.1"). Following such filing, PICA shall take such additional
actions, consistent with the terms set forth in the form of Plan
of Conversion, as may be required under

 

 

 

215 ILCS 5/59.1 or otherwise by the Director to complete its demutualization
pursuant to the provisions hereof and the Plan of Conversion. The Plan
of Conversion may contain such additional terms not set forth in the form of
Plan of Conversion included as Exhibit A or modifications to terms set forth
in the form of the Plan of Conversion as PICA may determine; provided,
however, that any such additional term or modification that modifies the (i)
total cash consideration or the method for allocating such cash consideration
among PICA's current and former Members, (ii) the sale of the PICA Common
Stock to PRA, (iii) amount or timing of the Conversion Credits, or (iv) the
Amended and Restated Articles or the Amended and Restated Bylaws shall
require the prior written consent of PRA, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

1.2 Approval of the Plan of Conversion. Subject to Section 7.9 hereof, the
Company, in accordance with the Plan of Conversion and Applicable Law, shall
submit a proposal to Eligible Members to approve the Plan of Conversion (the
"Proposal") and shall give such notice to Eligible Members containing the
date, time and place for voting on the Proposal as may be required under
Applicable Law (including 215 ILCS 5/59.1). Subject to Section 7.9 hereof,
the Proposal shall include the determination of PICA's Board of Directors
that the Plan of Conversion does not prejudice the interests of the Members
and is fair and equitable to the Members and shall include the Board of
Directors' recommendation that the Eligible Members approve the Plan of
Conversion.

 

 

 

1.3 Information Statement. PICA, with PRA's assistance at PICA's
reasonable request, shall prepare and provide to Eligible Members, in
connection with the solicitation of approval of the Plan of Conversion, an
information statement relating to the Plan of Conversion and the Sale,
including a copy of the Plan of Conversion (the "Information Statement") and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by state and federal law, including 215 ILCS 5/59.1,
and to obtain the approval of the Director of the Division for
the Information Statement. Each of PICA and PRA agrees that the information
provided and to be provided by PICA or PRA, as the case may be, specifically
for use in the Information Statement shall not, with respect to
the information supplied by such party (i) on the date upon which the
Information Statement is mailed to Eligible Members, (ii) on the date of the
public hearing before the Director in respect of the Plan of Conversion, if
any or (iii) on the last date on which Eligible Members are entitled to vote
on the Proposal, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No less than three days prior to the filing
of the Information Statement with the Director of the Division, PICA shall
provide PRA a draft of the Information Statement and an opportunity to
comment on such draft; provided, however, that PICA shall have the right to
accept or reject any such comments in its sole discretion. Each of PRA and
PICA agrees to correct as promptly as practicable any such information
provided by it that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and to take all steps necessary to furnish to the Director and obtain
the approval of the Director for any amendment or supplement to the
Information Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the Information
Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to Eligible Members to the
extent required by or advisable under Applicable Law.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

1.4 Approval of the Change of Control. Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, PRA shall request the Director to approve the change of control of
PICA and the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4.2 hereof)
as contemplated by the Plan of Conversion and this Agreement in accordance
with the requirements of 215 ILCS 5/131.4 of the Illinois Insurance Code. PRA
shall prepare and file with the Division a Form A and shall take such
commercially reasonable actions consistent with the terms of this Agreement
as may be required under 215 ILCS 5/131.4 of the Illinois Insurance Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder to obtain the Director\'s approval of
the change of control of PICA and the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries as
contemplated in the Plan of Conversion and this Agreement.

 

 

1.5 Effective Time of the Plan of Conversion. The "Effective Time" of the
Plan of Conversion shall be 12:01 a.m. Illinois time, on the date and time as
of which all of the following steps have been completed: (i) the Plan of
Conversion has been approved by the Director, (ii) the Eligible Members have
approved the Plan of Conversion by the requisite vote in accordance with the
Plan of Conversion, (iii) the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
have been duly adopted and (iv) the Effective Date Filing shall have been
made by PICA.

 

 

1.6 Alternative Structure. In the event that the Plan of Conversion or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement cannot be consummated in
accordance with the transaction structure provided for in the Plan of
Conversion and this Agreement, despite the parties' exercise of their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy
the other conditions to Closing set forth in Article 8, the parties shall
discuss in good faith consummation of the acquisition of PICA by PRA using a
different structure that is in compliance with Applicable Law and reasonably
acceptable to both PICA and PRA and that substantially preserves for the
parties the economic and other material benefits of the Plan of Conversion
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and satisfies all other
conditions to closing set forth in Article VIII hereof.

during the term of such Person's Consulting Agreement.

 

 

2.7 PRA Board of Directors. PRA shall cause Jerry D. Brant, DPM to be
elected as a director of PRA at or before the next annual meeting of the

policyholders and PRA hereby agrees, subject to operating constraints and
reasonable financial performance consistent with past practice, to continue
to operate PICA and its Subsidiaries as a freestanding operation (including

dividends as premium credits to its Qualified Policyholders in amounts
credited to such Qualified Policyholders in accordance with the Plan of
Conversion and adjusted pursuant thereto (collectively, the
"Conversion Credits").

 

 

(b) The Conversion Credits shall be allocated among the Qualified
Policyholders entitled thereto in accordance with the Plan of Conversion. The
Conversion Credits shall be payable as a credit against premium payments on
PICA insurance policies that are renewed by Qualified Policyholders in
accordance with the Plan of Conversion. If a Qualified Policyholder fails to
renew its PICA insurance policy in the year in which the Conversion Credit is
payable pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, such Qualified Policyholder shall

funds, a portion of the Purchase Price in the amount of $15,000,000 to fund
the crediting of the Conversion Credits to Qualified Policyholders pursuant
to the Plan of Conversion and Section 2.9(a) hereof and (ii) cause PICA to
deposit such amount in a segregated account established by PICA on or before
the Closing Date to be held in trust by PICA, separate and apart from any
other assets of PICA, for the sole purpose of funding the payment of the
Conversion Credits as required by the Plan of Conversion and Section 2.9(a)
(the "Credit Account").

 

 

(d) It is the intent of the parties hereto that all amounts held in trust in
the Credit Account will qualify as admitted assets of PICA. Any interest
earned on amounts held in trust in the Credit Account shall be transferred to
the general account of PICA and such amounts shall be distributable to PRA
in accordance with Applicable Law and following the approval of the Director,
if required, on or after April 1, 2013. No interest shall be accrued or
payable to the Qualified Policyholders on the Conversion Credits. PICA shall
not, and PRA shall cause PICA not to, declare, make or pay any dividend,
distribution or other payment to its shareholders prior to April 1, 2013 that
would require the approval of the Director or other Insurance Regulator under
the Insurance Laws, regardless of whether such approval has been received.

 

 

(e) It is the specific intent of the parties hereto that each Qualified
Policyholder is and will be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement for
the purposes of enforcing its rights to receive the Conversion Credits in the

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PICA

 

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, PICA shall
deliver to PRA a disclosure schedule (the "PICA Disclosure Schedule"). The
PICA Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the
sections contained in this Article and Sections 6.1 and 6.2; provided,
however, (i) that each exception set forth in the PICA Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of all representations and warranties
if such exception is contained in a section of the PICA Disclosure Schedule
corresponding to a section in this Article 4, and (ii) the mere inclusion of
an exception in the PICA Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission
by PICA that such exception represents a material fact, event or circumstance
or would result in a material adverse change or Material Adverse Effect on
PICA or any PICA Subsidiary. All documents and instruments attached as
exhibits or annexes to the PICA Disclosure Schedule are incorporated by
reference into the PICA Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in the PICA
Disclosure Schedule and in any changes to the PICA Disclosure Schedule that
are disclosed by PICA to PRA in accordance with Section 7.7 hereof, PICA
hereby represents and warrants to PRA, as of the date hereof or such other
date as specified, as follows:

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.1 Corporate Organization.

 

 

(a) PICA is a mutual insurance company duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of the State of Illinois. PICA has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on PICA.

 

 

(b) PICA is (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company in
Illinois, (ii) duly licensed or authorized to carry on an insurance business
in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or
authorized, and (iii) duly authorized in Illinois and each other applicable
jurisdiction to write its lines of business as required by Applicable Law
except, in each case, where such failure to be so licensed or authorized
would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on
PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (collectively, all such
licenses and authorizations, the "PICA Permits"). Section 4.1 of the PICA
Disclosure Schedule identifies the type of insurance lines that PICA is
authorized or licensed to write in each state. All of such licenses are in
full force and effect, and there is no proceeding or investigation by any
Governmental Authority pending or, to the Knowledge of PICA, threatened which
would reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, failure to renew,
suspension, material limitation or material restriction of such license. To
the Knowledge of PICA, PICA has conducted its business in all respects in
compliance with all terms and conditions of such licenses and Applicable Law,
except where failure to so comply has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

4.2 Subsidiaries.

 

 

(a) Section 4.2(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
correct list of each Subsidiary of PICA (the "PICA Subsidiaries"),
together with the state of incorporation or organization of each
PICA Subsidiary. Each PICA Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and
validly existing as a corporation under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in
all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it
to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would have a
Material Adverse Effect on PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

 

 

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule identifies the PICA
Subsidiaries that write insurance and the states or other jurisdictions in
which they are authorized or licensed to write insurance, and the type of
insurance lines that they are authorized or licensed to write in each such
sate (the "PICA Insurance Subsidiaries"). Each PICA Insurance Subsidiary is
(i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company in its jurisdiction
of incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized to carry on an
insurance business in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so
licensed or authorized, and (iii) duly authorized in its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

jurisdiction of incorporation and each other applicable jurisdiction to write
its line of business as required by Applicable Law except, in each case,
where such failure to be so licensed or authorized would not individually or
in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on PICA and the PICA
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (collectively, all such licenses and
authorizations, the "PACO Permits" and together with the PICA Permits, the
"Permits"). All of such licenses are in full force and effect and there is no
proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Authority pending or, to the
Knowledge of PICA, threatened which would reasonably be expected to lead to
the revocation, failure to renew, suspension, material limitation or material
restriction of such license. To the Knowledge of PICA, each PICA
Insurance Subsidiary has conducted its respective businesses in all respects
in compliance with all terms and conditions of such licenses and Applicable
Law, except where any failure to so comply has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
PICA is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the PICA Subsidiaries.
There are no irrevocable proxies granted by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary with
respect to such shares. There are no equity securities of any of the PICA
Subsidiaries that are or may become required to be issued by reason of any
options, warrants, scrips, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of
any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible
into or exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of any of the PICA
Subsidiaries except shares of the PICA Subsidiaries issued to, or required to
be issued to, other wholly owned PICA Subsidiaries. There are no contracts,
commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any of the
PICA Subsidiaries is bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock
or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares
of its capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such shares. All of the shares of the PICA Subsidiaries described in
the first sentence of this Section 4.2(c) are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and are owned by PICA or a
PICA Subsidiary free and clear of any and all Liens.

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of PICA and each of the PICA
Subsidiaries (as amended to date). PICA has made available to PRA all of the
minute books containing the records of the meetings of the shareholders, the
Board of Directors and any committee of the Board of Directors of PICA and
each of the PICA Subsidiaries (except for confidential portions of such
minutes relating to the Plan of Conversion). To the Knowledge of PICA, the
minute books of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries reflect all of the material
actions taken at a meeting or by written consent of the Board of Directors of
PICA.

 

 

(b) The Plan of Conversion and the Amended and Restated Articles and Amended
and Restated Bylaws have been approved by the Board of Directors of PICA and,
when the Plan of Conversion and the Amended and Restated Articles have been
approved by the Director of the Division and the Eligible Members of PICA as
required under Section 1.2, PICA will be converted from a mutual insurance
company to a stock insurance company at the Effective Time in accordance with
the Applicable Law of the state of Illinois, including 215 ILCS 5/59.1. At
the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Articles and the Amended and
Restated Bylaws shall be duly authorized and validly adopted and in full
force and effect.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.4 Capitalization.

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of PICA under the
Amended and Restated Articles will be issued and sold to PRA pursuant to the
Plan of Conversion and this Agreement. The shares of PICA Common Stock
issued to PRA pursuant to the Plan of Conversion will constitute all of the
issued and outstanding shares of PICA Common Stock, all of which will be duly
authorized and validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. As of the date of this Agreement and other than as
provided in the Plan of Conversion or this Agreement, PICA does not have and
is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of PICA Common Stock or any other equity securities of
PICA or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of PICA Common Stock or any other equity securities of
PICA. As of the date of this Agreement no shares of PICA Common Stock were
reserved for issuance except as provided in the Plan of Conversion.

 

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement and other than as required in connection
with that certain Indenture between PICA and Wilmington Trust Company dated
May 22, 2003, PICA does not have and is not bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, warrants, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any guaranty fund certificates, surplus notes
or other subordinated indebtedness that would be considered as an equity
equivalent under SAP (as defined in Section 4.6(b) hereof).

 

 

4.5 Authority; No Violation; Consents and Approvals.

 

 

(a) Subject to the receipt of all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, PICA has
full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and

financial point of view, to the Eligible Members and DR Former Members, as
a group.

4.6 Insurance Reports.

 

 

(a) "PICA SAP Statements" means (i) the annual statutory statements of each
of PICA and the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries filed with the Insurance
Regulator of the jurisdiction of domicile of PICA or the applicable PICA
Insurance Subsidiary, as applicable, as of and for each of the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, (ii) the quarterly unaudited statutory
statements of PICA and each of the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries filed with the

thereto.

 

 

(b) Each PICA SAP Statement was prepared in accordance with statutory
accounting principles ("SAP") prescribed or permitted by the Division in
conformity with practices consistently applied by PICA or the PICA Insurance
Subsidiary, as applicable, without modification of the accounting principles
used in the preparation thereof and presents fairly the statutory financial
position and results of operations of PICA or the PICA Insurance Subsidiary,
as applicable, as of the dates and for the periods indicated in accordance
with SAP. The annual balance sheets and income statements included in the
PICA SAP Statements have been, where required by Insurance Laws, audited by
an independent accounting firm. Since January 1, 2005 PICA and each PICA
Insurance Subsidiary have filed all PICA SAP Statements and all other reports
and statements, together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
required to be filed with any Insurance Regulator under the Insurance Laws.
Section 4.6(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of, and PICA
has made available to PRA, complete copies of, all such PICA SAP Statements
and all audit opinions related thereto.

 

 

(c) Since January 1, 2005 PICA and each PICA Insurance Subsidiary (i) have
filed or submitted with all applicable Insurance Regulators all registration
statements, notices and reports, together with all supplements and amendments
thereto required by Article VIII ½ of the Illinois Insurance Code or similar
Applicable Laws governing Insurance holding company systems in other states
(the "PICA Holding Company Act Reports"), and (ii) have paid all material
fees and assessments due and payable by them under the Insurance Laws.
Section 4.6(c) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule (x) sets forth a list of, and
PICA has made available to PRA, complete copies of, all PICA Holding Company
Act Reports filed with the Division, and (y) identifies each denial of a
request for rate increases received by PICA from any Insurance Regulator
since December 31, 2004. All such PICA SAP Statements, PICA Holding Company
Act Reports and other reports and statements substantially complied with the
Insurance Laws when filed and, as of their respective dates, contained
substantially all information required under the Insurance Laws and did not
contain any false statements or material misstatements of fact or omit to
state any material facts necessary to make the statements set forth therein
not materially misleading in light of the circumstances in which such
statements were made. This Section 4.6(c) does not apply to Taxes, which are
covered exclusively by Section 4.12.

 

 

(d) Except for normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Authority in
the regular course of the business of PICA and its Subsidiaries, and except
as set forth in Section 4.6(d) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, to the

investigation into the business or operations of PICA, any PICA Subsidiary,
or any director or officer of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, since January 1,
2005 that remains open on the date hereof. There is no unresolved violation
or exception that is not capable of being cured without an incurrence of a
material adverse penalty or monetary fine by any Governmental Authority with
respect to any examinations of PICA or any of its Subsidiaries.

examinations that any Insurance Regulator has conducted with respect to PICA
or any of the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries since December 31, 2004. PICA has

4.6(f) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2005, neither PICA
nor any PICA Subsidiary has received from any Person any notice on Form A or
such other form as may be prescribed under Applicable Law indicating that
such Person intends to make or has made a tender offer for or a request or
invitation for tenders of, or intends to enter into or has entered into any
agreement to exchange securities for, or intends to acquire or has acquired
(in the open market or otherwise), any voting security of PICA or a PICA
Insurance Subsidiary, if after the consummation thereof such Person would
directly or indirectly be in control of PICA or a PICA Insurance Subsidiary.

PICA and the consolidated PICA Subsidiaries for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, together with reports on all such financial statements
by Ernst and Young LLP, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheets for
PICA and the consolidated PICA Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2008 and the
related unaudited consolidated statements of earnings, policyholders' equity
and cash flows for the six (6) month period ended June 30, 2008 (such
financial statements are collectively referred to as the "Consolidated
Financial Statements").

 

 

(b) The Consolidated Financial Statements including all notes and schedules
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States ("GAAP") throughout the periods involved
(except in case of unaudited financial statements that do not contain all
footnotes and year-end adjustments which may be required by GAAP) and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of PICA and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein).

 

 

(c) PICA maintains internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
financial statements of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries. Neither the Board
of Directors nor audit committee of PICA

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

or any PICA Subsidiary have been advised by their accountants or consultants
of: (x) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Section 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(d) of the
Exchange Act) of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary which could adversely affect its
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, or (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a role in the internal controls over financial reporting of PICA or
any PICA Subsidiary.

 

 

(d) As of the date hereof, neither PICA nor any of the PICA Subsidiaries had
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise which would be required to be reflected, reserved for
or disclosed in a consolidated balance sheet of PICA and the consolidated
PICA Subsidiaries, including the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with
GAAP except (A) as reflected, reserved for or disclosed in the consolidated
balance sheet of PICA and the consolidated PICA Subsidiaries as of June 30,
2008, including the notes thereto, (B) as incurred since June 30, 2008 in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (C) as incurred or
to be incurred by PICA or any Subsidiary pursuant to, in connection with, or
as a result of, the Plan of Conversion and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (D) other than liabilities pursuant to
contractual obligations identified in this Agreement or the PICA Disclosure
Schedule.

 

 

(e) Section 4.7(e) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule lists, and PICA has made
available to PRA copies of the documentation creating or governing, all "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) effected by PICA or any of the PICA Subsidiaries since
December 31, 2005.

 

 

(f) Ernst and Young LLP, which has expressed its opinion with respect to
the Consolidated Financial Statements (including the related notes), is and
has been throughout the periods covered by such financial statements a
registered public accounting firm (as defined in Section 2(a)(12) of Sarbanes
Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"). Section 4.7(f) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule
lists all non-audit services (as such term is defined by SOX) performed by
Ernst and Young LLP for PICA and each PICA Subsidiary for each year commencing
after December 31, 2004.

 

 

(g) The books and records of PICA and each of the PICA Subsidiaries (i) are
and have been properly prepared and maintained in form and substance adequate
for preparing audited consolidated financial statements, in accordance
with regulatory accounting principles required by GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and, (ii) reflect only
actual transactions.

 

 

4.8 Broker's Fees. Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the PICA Disclosure
Schedule (which sets forth amounts paid or to be paid and names of parties to
which such amounts were or will be paid), none of PICA, the PICA Subsidiaries
and Persons acting on their respective behalf, has employed any broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any broker's fees or commissions, or
investment banker fees or commissions, or finder's fees in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

 

 

 

(a) Since December 31, 2007, and except as set forth in Section 4.9(a) of the

as required by Applicable Law): (i) increased the wages,
salaries, compensation, pension, or other fringe benefits or perquisites

thereof in effect as of December 31, 2007, except for changes in benefits in

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule
and excluding claims made with respect to insurance policies or insurance
contracts issued by PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary for which a claims
reserve has been established, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
PICA, threatened, suits, actions, proceedings, claims or Governmental
Authority investigations (whether at law or equity, before or by any
Governmental Authority or before any arbitrator) against PICA, any PICA
Subsidiary, any of their respective businesses or assets, any directors or

4.11 Insurance.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries maintain policies of general liability, fire
and casualty, automobile, directors and officers, errors and omissions,
fiduciary, and other forms of insurance (the "PICA Insurance Policies") in
such amounts, with such deductibles and against such risks and losses, which
PICA's management has reasonably determined to be prudent in accordance with
industry practices, for the business and assets of PICA and the PICA
Subsidiaries. All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums
due and payable thereon have been paid (other than retroactive or
retrospective premium adjustments that are not yet, but may be, required to
be paid with respect to any period ending prior to the Closing Date under
comprehensive general liability and worker's compensation
insurance policies), and no notice of cancellation or termination has been
received with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on
substantially similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation. To the
Knowledge of PICA, the activities and operations of PICA and the PICA
Subsidiaries have been conducted in a manner so as to conform in all material
respects to all applicable provisions of such insurance policies.

 

 

(b) No issuer of the PICA Insurance Policies has issued a reservation-of-
rights letter, or entered into a nonwaiver agreement, or otherwise denied or
limited coverage (in whole or in part), under any of the PICA Insurance
Policies, and to the Knowledge of PICA, no declaratory judgment has been
sought by any Person or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction that
denies or limits coverage (in whole or in part) under any of the PICA
Insurance Policies.

 

 

4.12 Taxes and Tax Returns.

 

 

(a) As used in this Agreement: "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal, state,
county, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, gross
income, profits, franchise, license, ad valorem, profits, gains, capital,
sales, transfer, use, payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties,
intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, stamp, occupation, premium,
social security (or similar), unemployment, disability, real property,
personal property, sales, use, registration, alternative or add on minimum,
estimated, and other taxes, charges, levies or like assessments (together
with all penalties and additions to tax and interest thereon). "Tax Return"
or "Tax Returns" means any and all returns, declarations, claims for refunds,
reports, information returns and information statements (including, without
limitation, Form 1099, Form W-2 and W-3, Form 5500, and Form 990) with
respect to Taxes filed (including any attached schedules), or required to be
filed, by any Person or any Subsidiary of such Person with the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") or any other Governmental Authority or tax authority
or agency, whether domestic or foreign (including consolidated, combined and
unitary tax returns).

 

 

(b) PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries have duly filed all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by them on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all
such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and
have duly paid or made sufficient provisions for the payment of all Taxes
shown thereon as owing on or prior to the date of this Agreement other than
Taxes which are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith
and have not

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

been finally determined for which adequate reserves have been made on
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except as disclosed in
Section 4.12(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, neither PICA nor any PICA
Subsidiary has waived in writing any statute of limitations in respect of
Taxes or agreed in writing to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
Return or tax assessment or deficiency, other than extensions that are
automatically granted by the taxing authorities upon filing an application
therefor, which waiver or extension is currently in effect. The unpaid Taxes
of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries do not exceed the reserve for tax liability
set forth on the balance sheets referenced in Section 4.7 of this Agreement
as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance
with past custom and practice of PICA in filing its returns. To the Knowledge
of PICA, no claim has been made since December 31, 2003 by any Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction where PICA or any PICA Subsidiary does not file
Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

 

(c) There is no claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding or investigation now
pending or, proposed or threatened in writing against or with respect to PICA
or any PICA Subsidiary in respect of any material Tax. PICA and each
PICA Subsidiary in connection with amounts paid or owed to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party have
complied with applicable tax withholding in all material respects. PICA and
each PICA Subsidiary have reported such withheld amounts to the appropriate
taxing authority and to each such employee, independent contractor,
creditor, shareholder or other third party as required by Applicable Law.

 

 

(d) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of PICA or its
Subsidiaries except Liens for current Taxes not yet due. Neither PICA nor any
PICA Subsidiary has been required to include in income any adjustment
pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason of a voluntary change in
accounting method initiated by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, and the IRS has
not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method.
Except as set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements, neither PICA
nor any PICA Subsidiary has entered into a transaction which is being
accounted for as an installment obligation under Section 453 of the Code.
Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any tax
indemnity, tax sharing or tax allocation agreement (other than such
agreements as exist by and among themselves). Except as set forth in Section
4.12(d) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary
has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the
meaning of Section 1504 of the Code other than an affiliated group in which
PICA has been the common parent corporation. Except with respect to
membership in the affiliated groups disclosed in Section 4.12(d) of the PICA
Disclosure Schedule, neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is liable for the
Taxes of any Person under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) or by contract, as
a successor or otherwise. During the five (5) year period ending on the date
of this Agreement, neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary was a distributing
corporation or a controlled corporation in a transaction intended to be
governed by Section 355 of the Code. Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is
a party to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement or contract
that could be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
PICA's basis and excess loss account, if any, in each PICA Subsidiary is set
forth in Section 4.12(d) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(e) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
any amount that is reasonably likely to be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of PICA
or any of its affiliates who is a "Disqualified Individual" (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or PICA Employee Plan (as defined in Section 4.13 of this
Agreement) currently in effect will not be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code).

 

 

(f) To the Knowledge of PICA, there is no dispute or claim concerning any tax
liability of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary except as disclosed in Section
4.12(f) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule. Section 4.12(f) of the PICA
Disclosure Schedule identifies the last Tax Returns that have been audited by
the taxing authority with whom they were filed, and indicates those Tax
Returns that currently are the subject of an audit procedure or that PICA or
any PICA Subsidiary has received written notice will be subject to an
audit procedure. PICA has made available to PRA correct and complete
copies of all federal income Tax Returns (including amendments thereto) of,
all examination reports of, and statements of deficiencies assessed against
or agreed to by, PICA or any PICA Subsidiary since December 31, 2004. Except
to the extent other representations and warranties in this Article 4 relate
expressly to Taxes, the representations and warranties made in this Section
4.12 are the only representations and warranties made by PICA with respect to
matters relating to Taxes (including Tax Returns and Tax allocation
agreements).

 

 

4.13 Employee Plans; Labor Matters.

 

 

(a) Section 4.13(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Employee Plans (as defined in Section 10.16(a))
for employees of PICA and any PICA Subsidiary ("PICA Employee Plans"). Those
PICA Employee Plans which are non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code are separately identified in Section
4.13(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule. Except with respect to the PICA
Employee Plans, neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary sponsors, maintains or
contributes to, or has any ongoing obligation or liability whatsoever with
respect to: (i) any employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or (ii)
any other program, plan, trust agreement or arrangement for any bonus,
severance, hospitalization, vacation, sick pay, deferred compensation,
pension, profit sharing, post-employment, retirement, payroll savings, stock
option, stock purchase, group insurance, self insurance, death benefit,
fringe benefit, welfare or any other employee benefit plan or fringe benefit
arrangement of any nature whatsoever including those for the benefit of
former employees. PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries have not made or
entered into any written or oral agreement, arrangement, commitment, or
understanding to create any additional PICA Employee Plan or to continue,
modify, change, or terminate, in any material respect, any PICA Employee
Plan.

 

 

(b) PICA has heretofore delivered or made available to PRA complete copies
or descriptions of each PICA Employee Plan and certain related documents,
including where applicable, (i) the plan document and the related trust
agreement or annuity contract for such PICA Employee Plan; (ii) the summary
plan description and material employee communication

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

document for such PICA Employee Plan; (iii) the actuarial report for such
PICA Employee Plan for each of the last two years; (iv) all determination
letters from the IRS for such PICA Employee Plan; (v) all insurance policies
relating thereto and any written materials used by PICA to describe employee
benefits to employees of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries; (vi) the most recent
annual return on Form 5500 (including all schedules thereto along with
the accompanying auditor's opinion) and tax return (Form 990) for such PICA
Employee Plan; (vii) the most current actuarial, valuation, and trustee's
reports for such PICA Employee Plan; and (viii) all material communications
with any Governmental Authority (including the Department of Labor, the IRS,
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the SEC) with respect to such
PICA Employee Plan. Each such actuarial or valuation report correctly shows
the value of the assets of such PICA Employee Plan as of the date thereof,
the total accrued and vested liabilities, all contributions by PICA and the
PICA Subsidiaries, and the assumptions on which the calculations are based.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(c) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
each of the PICA Employee Plans has been operated and administered in
substantial compliance with Applicable Laws, including, but not limited to,
ERISA and the Code. To the Knowledge of PICA, there has not been any
material violation of the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Code and
ERISA with respect to any PICA Employee Plan. There has not been any
termination or partial termination (including any termination or partial
termination attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
of such plans. Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary nor any of
their respective ERISA affiliates, nor any predecessor thereof, contributes
to, or has within the past six years contributed to, any multiemployer plans,
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or any multiple employer welfare
arrangements, as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. Neither PICA nor any
PICA Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA affiliates, nor any
predecessor thereof, sponsors, participates in, or contributes to, or has at
any time in the past sponsored, participated in, or contributed to (i) any
plan which is subject to the funding standards or requirements described in
Section 412 of the Code, or (ii) any plan which is subject to any of the
requirements, obligations, and liabilities imposed by Title IV of ERISA.

 

 

(d) Each PICA Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or has
pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such
determination from the IRS, and PICA is not aware of any reason why any such
determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued, and any related
trust is intended to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code. PICA has made available to PRA copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such PICA Employee
Plan (if applicable). To the Knowledge of PICA, no prohibited transaction
within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or
breach of fiduciary duty under Title I of ERISA has occurred with respect to
any PICA Employee Plan or with respect to PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, and no
events have occurred with respect to any PICA Employee Plan that could result
in payment or assessment by or against PICA or any of its Subsidiaries of any
material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B,
4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

 

 

(e) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by PICA or any of the PICA Subsidiaries relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any PICA Employee Plan
which would increase materially the expense of maintaining PICA Employee
Plans above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. No event has occurred or circumstances
exist that could result in a material increase in the premium costs of PICA
Employee Plans that are insured, or a material increase in benefit costs of
the PICA Employee Plans that are self-insured.  

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(f) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
there is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending against
or involving or, to the Knowledge of PICA, threatened against or involving
any PICA Employee Plan before any court or arbitrator or any state, federal
or local governmental body, agency or official, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on PICA. Other than claims for benefits submitted by
participants or beneficiaries, no claim against, or legal proceeding
involving, any PICA Employee Plan is pending or, to the Knowledge of PICA,
threatened.

 

 

(g) Except as described in Section 4.13(g) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Conversion and this Agreement
will (i) result in any material payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or
employee of PICA or any of its Subsidiaries from PICA or any of its
Subsidiaries under any PICA Employee Plan or otherwise; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any PICA Employee Plan; (iii)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits to any material extent (in each case under clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) whether or not such payment or benefit would constitute a parachute
payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code); or (iv) constitute a
prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code, or breach of fiduciary duty under Title I of ERISA.

 

 

(h) Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary has any direct or indirect material
liability or obligation under any PICA Employee Plan other than as described
in the terms of such PICA Employee Plans. There are no circumstances arising
out of the sponsorship of any PICA Employee Plan which will result in any
direct or indirect material liability to PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, other
than liability for contributions, benefit payments, administrative costs and
liabilities incurred in accordance with the terms of the PICA Employee Plans
consistent with past practice.

 

 

(i) PICA and each PICA Subsidiary have made all payments and contributions
due from them to each PICA Employee Plan. There are no funded benefit
obligations under any PICA Employee Plan for which contributions have not
been made or properly accrued, and there are no unfunded benefit obligations
that have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

 

(j) Each PICA Employee Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is not qualified under
Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code is exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of
Title I of ERISA as an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the
purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management
or highly compensated employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and
401(a)(1) of ERISA. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(j) of the PICA
Disclosure Schedule, no assets of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary are allocated
to or held in a "rabbi trust" or similar funding vehicle.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(k) Each PICA Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined in
Section 607(1) of ERISA or Section 5001(b)(1) of the Code) has been operated
at all times in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
("COBRA"), with the provisions of the Code and ERISA enacted by the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), and with
the provisions of any applicable similar state law.

any potential violation by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary of any Applicable
Laws regarding labor and employment or the compensation therefor (including,
without limitation, any of the aforementioned statutes) during the past five
(5) years.

 

 

(c) Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any
collective bargaining contract, nor is any such contract currently being
negotiated by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of PICA, there
are no pending activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any
employees of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary. Since December 31, 2007, no

employment or facility of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary; (ii) a "mass layoff"
(as defined in the WARN Act); or (iii) such other transaction, layoff,
reduction in force or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of any similar foreign, state or local law.

 

 

4.15 Compliance with Applicable Law.

 

 

(a) Other than generally applicable requirements of Applicable Laws, neither
PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is subject to any cease-and-desist or other
order issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar written undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by,

that it is considering issuing or requesting any such PICA Regulatory
Agreement.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.15(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
there are no material contracts (other than contracts relating to
employment), real estate leases, loans, guarantees or other arrangements or
transactions of any nature between PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any of their respective officers, directors, or other Affiliates,
on the other hand. PICA has not extended or maintained credit, arranged for
the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of credit, in the form of
a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer (or
equivalent thereof) of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary that is now or will be

the performance of business for PICA consistent with the expense policy of
PICA.

 

 

(c) None of PICA, the PICA Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of PICA, any
of their respective current or former officers or directors or current or

4.16 Certain Contracts.

 

 

(a) Section 4.16(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule lists all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, commitments, or understandings (whether written or
oral) other than insurance policies issued by PICA or any PICA Insurance
Subsidiary to which PICA or a PICA Subsidiary is a party or bound by: (i)
with respect to the employment of any directors, officers or employees; (ii)
which, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or
events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)
becoming due from PICA, PRA, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
director, officer or employee thereof; (iii) which contains obligations for
PICA or any PICA Subsidiary to pay in excess of $100,000 in any twelve month

$100,000 in any twelve month period; (iv) that concerns a partnership or
joint venture that is not consolidated with PICA for financial reporting
purposes; (v) that contractually limits the ability of PICA or any PICA
Subsidiary to compete with respect to any product, service or territory; (vi)

days notice or less; (vii) that provides for the payment to an employee of
PICA or any PICA Subsidiary any incentive or bonus compensation based on the
productivity or performance of such employee or of PICA or any
PICA Subsidiary; or (viii) any of the benefits of which will be increased, or
the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of
any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. PICA has made available to
PRA complete copies of all employment and deferred compensation agreements
which are in writing and to which PICA or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

any PICA Subsidiary is a party. Each contract, agreement,
arrangement, commitment, or understanding (whether written or oral) of the
type described in Section 4.16(a) of this Agreement, whether or not set forth
in the PICA Disclosure Schedule, is referred to in this Agreement as a "PICA
Contract," and neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary has received notice of
any, and to the Knowledge of PICA there has been no, violation of any PICA
Contract by any of the other parties thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the
term "PICA Contracts" does not include any insurance policy or contract
issued by PICA or a PICA Insurance Subsidiary.

 

 

(b) With respect to each PICA Contract, such PICA Contract is (assuming due
power and authority of, and due execution and delivery by, the other parties
thereto) in full force and effect (except for contracts that have expired
pursuant to the terms thereof) and is legally valid, binding and enforceable
against PICA or any of the PICA Subsidiaries and to the Knowledge of PICA,
the other party thereto in accordance with its terms (except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies). There are no material defaults
by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of PICA, any other
party, under such PICA Contract. Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary has
received written or, to the Knowledge of PICA, oral notice of any default,
offset, counterclaim or defense under such PICA Contract. No condition or
event has occurred which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would constitute a default or breach by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, or,
to the Knowledge of PICA, any other party under the terms of such
PICA Contract.

 

 

4.17 Investments and Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.17(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
PICA and each PICA Subsidiary are the record or beneficial owners of all of
its investment securities (except securities sold under repurchase agreements
or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any Lien.
Such securities are valued on the books of PICA in accordance with GAAP other
than where the failure to be so valued has not had, or would not be
reasonably expected to have, a Materially Adverse Effect. Section 4.17(a) of
the PICA Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the securities which are
in default in the payment of principal, interest or dividends or which PICA
has recorded as impaired to any material extent. PICA has provided to PRA a
copy of the investment policies of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries as of
June 30, 2008. There has been no material change in investment policy
of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries or in the composition of the investments of
PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries since June 30, 2008.

 

 

(b) All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other
interest rate risk management arrangements entered into for the account of
PICA or any of the PICA Subsidiaries were entered into in the ordinary course
of business and, to the Knowledge of PICA, in accordance with Applicable Laws
and with counterparties reasonably determined by PICA\'s management to be
financially responsible at the time. All of such interest rate swaps,
caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk
management arrangements are (assuming due power and authority of, and due
execution and delivery by, the other parties thereto) legal, valid and
binding obligations of PICA or any of the PICA Subsidiaries enforceable in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
fraudulent

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

conveyance, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and are in full force and effect. PICA and each PICA Subsidiary
have duly performed in all material respects all of their material
obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued; and, to the Knowledge of PICA, there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.

 

 

4.18 Intellectual Property.

 

 

(a) PICA or a PICA Subsidiary owns or has the right to use, pursuant to
license, sublicense, agreement or permission, all Intellectual Property
necessary for the operation of the businesses of PICA and the PICA
Subsidiaries as presently conducted except for such Intellectual Property,
the absence of which is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" means all
trademarks, service marks, logos, domains and domain names, trade names and
corporate names and registrations and applications for registration thereof,
copyrights and registrations and applications for registration thereof,
computer software (including computer software used in insurance operations
or for accounting operations), data and documentation, trade secrets and
confidential business information (including financial, marketing and
business data, pricing and cost information, business and marketing plans,
and customer and supplier lists and information), other proprietary rights,
and copies and tangible embodiments thereof (in whatever form or medium).
Section 4.18(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule lists all material registered
Intellectual Property owned by PICA and each PICA Subsidiary and used in
their respective businesses.

 

 

(b) To the Knowledge of PICA, neither the businesses of PICA nor any PICA
Subsidiary infringes, violates or misappropriates any Intellectual Property
of third parties. Since December 31, 2007, none of PICA, the
PICA Subsidiaries, or any of the directors, officers or employees with
responsibility for intellectual property matters of PICA or any PICA
Subsidiary in their respective capacities as directors, officers or employees
has received any written charge, complaint, claim or notice alleging any such
infringement, misappropriation or violation. Except as set forth in Section
4.18(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of PICA, no third
party has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come
into conflict with any Intellectual Property rights of PICA or any
PICA Subsidiary.

 

 

(c) Section 4.18(c) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule identifies each item of
Intellectual Property that any third party owns and is material to the
business of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary and further identifies each item that
is subject to confidentiality restrictions of the type set forth in the
following sentence; provided that Section 4.18(c) of the PICA Disclosure
Schedule omits Intellectual Property that constitutes commercially available
computer software (and associated documentation). Subject to any applicable
confidentiality obligations of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, PICA has made
complete copies of all such licenses, sublicenses, agreements and permissions
(as amended to date) available to PRA. With respect to each such item of such
Intellectual Property: (i) the license, sublicense, agreement or
permission covering the item is legal, valid, binding and enforceable against
PICA or the applicable PICA Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of PICA, against
the third party thereto, and in full force and effect; (ii) except as set
forth in Section 4.5(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, the
license, sublicense,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

agreement or permission will continue to be legal, valid, binding and
enforceable against PICA or the applicable PICA Subsidiary and, to the
Knowledge of PICA, the third party thereto, and in full force and effect on
identical terms on and after the Closing Date; (iii) to the Knowledge of
PICA, no party to the license, sublicense, agreement or permission is in
breach or default, and no event of default has occurred which with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default or permit
termination, modification or acceleration thereunder; (iv) to the Knowledge
of PICA, no party to the license, sublicense, agreement or permission has
repudiated any provision thereof; and (v) neither PICA nor any PICA
Subsidiary has granted any sublicense or similar right with respect to the
license, sublicense, agreement or permission.

 

 

4.19 Real Property; Environmental Liability.

 

 

(a) Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary owns any right, title or interest in
any real property except as described in Section 4.19(a) of the PICA
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "PICA Real Property"). Section
4.19(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate
list and general description of all material leases for real property
("PICA Real Property Leases") to which PICA or any PICA Subsidiary is a party
or by which any of them are bound. PICA or any PICA Subsidiary owns
all right, title and interest in, and has good and marketable title to, the
PICA Real Property, and PICA or any PICA Subsidiary has a valid leasehold
interest in each PICA Real Property Lease, in each case free and clear of all
Liens except for (i) rights of lessors, co-lessees or sublessees that are
reflected in each PICA Real Property Lease; (ii) current taxes or other
charges or assessments of any Governmental Authority, in each case, not yet
due and payable; and (iii) such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if
any, as do not materially detract from the value of or materially interfere
with the present use of the subject property. To the Knowledge of PICA,
the activities of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries with respect to all PICA
Real Property and PICA Real Property Leases used in connection with their
operations are in all material respects permitted and authorized by
applicable zoning laws, ordinances and regulations.

 

 

(b) PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession
under all PICA Real Property Leases. PICA has made available to PRA
complete and correct copies of all of the PICA Real Property Leases. Each
PICA Real Property Lease is (assuming due power and authority of, and due
execution by, the other party thereto) in full force and effect and is
legally valid, binding and enforceable against PICA or the applicable PICA
Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of PICA, the third party thereto in
accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent
conveyance, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies). There are no monetary defaults and no material nonmonetary
defaults by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of PICA, any
other party, under any PICA Real Property Lease. Neither PICA nor any PICA
Subsidiary has received written or, to the Knowledge of PICA, oral notice of
any default, offset, counterclaim or defense under any PICA Real Property
Lease. Except as set forth in Section 4.5(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
no condition or event has occurred which with the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute a default or breach by PICA or any
PICA Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of PICA, any other party, under of the
terms of any PICA Real Property Lease. To the Knowledge of PICA, there are no
purchase contracts, options or other agreements of any kind whereby any
Person has acquired or will have any basis to assert any right, title or
interest in, or right to the possession, use, enjoyment or proceeds of, any
part or all of the interests in the real property subject to the PICA Real
Property Leases.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits, except for
instances of non-compliance which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There are no
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings pending, no claims,
actions, or causes of action filed or asserted in writing, or, to the
Knowledge of PICA, private environmental investigations or remediation
activities or governmental investigations of any nature ongoing or threatened
seeking to impose on PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition on PICA or any PICA Subsidiary of, any
liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law which would have
a Material Adverse Effect on PICA. To the Knowledge of PICA, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
remediation activity. Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is subject to
any agreement, order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement by or with
any Governmental Authority or private Person imposing any liability or
obligation under any Environmental Law that would have a Material Adverse
Effect on PICA. For purposes of this Section 4.19, the terms "PICA" and
"PICA Subsidiaries" include any Person that is, in whole or in part, a
predecessor of PICA or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

4.20 Personal Property.

 

 

(a) None of the personal property owned by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary is
subject to any Lien except Permitted Liens.

property lease to which PICA or any PICA Subsidiary is a party that is not
cancelable upon ninety (90) days notice without penalty and has monthly rent
that exceeds $1,500 (collectively, the "PICA Personal Property Leases").
PICA has made available to PRA complete and correct copies of all of the PICA
Personal Property Leases. Each PICA Personal Property Lease (assuming due
power and authority of, and due execution by, the other party) is in full
force and effect and is legally valid, binding and enforceable against PICA
or the applicable PICA Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of PICA, against the
third party thereto, in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the
availability of equitable remedies). There are no material defaults by PICA
or any PICA Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of PICA, any other party, under
any PICA Personal Property Lease. Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary
has received written or, to the Knowledge of PICA, oral notice of any
material default, offset, counterclaim or defense under any PICA Personal
Property Lease. No condition or event has occurred which with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a material default
or breach by PICA or any PICA Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of PICA, any
other party under of the terms of any PICA Personal Property Lease. To
the Knowledge of PICA, there are no purchase contracts, options or other
agreements of any kind whereby any Person has acquired or will have any basis
to assert any right, title or interest in, or right to the possession, use,
enjoyment or proceeds of, any part or all of the interests in the personal
property subject to the PICA Personal Property Leases and material to the
business of PICA.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.21 Insurance Matters.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.21(a) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
all policies, binders, slips, certificates and other agreements of insurance
in effect as of the date hereof (including all applications, endorsements,
supplements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection therewith) issued
by PICA and the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries, and any and all marketing
materials, agents agreements, brokers agreements, service contracts, and
managing general agents agreements to which PICA or any PICA Subsidiary is a
party, are, to the extent required under Applicable Law, on forms approved by
the Insurance Regulators or have been filed with and not objected to by such
Insurance Regulators within the period provided for objection subject to such
exceptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on PICA and the
PICA Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and all of such forms comply with the
Insurance Laws in all material respects. As to premium rates established by
PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary which are required to be filed with or
approved by any Insurance Regulators, such rates have been so filed or
approved and the premiums charged conform thereto. Section 4.21(a) of the
PICA Disclosure Schedule sets forth all increases in premium rates for
medical professional liability insurance submitted by PICA and the PICA
Insurance Subsidiaries which have been disapproved by any Insurance
Regulators since December 31, 2004. Section 4.21(a) of the PICA Disclosure
Schedule lists all written correspondence or written communications from any
Insurance Regulator received by PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary after
December 31, 2004 that requests or states that its premium rates, if
applicable, for professional liability insurance should be reduced below the
current approved premium levels.

 

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.21(b) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule,
neither PICA nor any PICA Insurance Subsidiary has issued any participating
policies or any retrospectively rated policies of insurance and neither PICA
nor any PICA Insurance Subsidiary has declared any policyholder dividend
which has not been paid prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) All reinsurance treaties or agreements, including retrocessional
agreements, to which PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary is a party and
under which PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary has any existing rights,
obligations or liabilities are listed in Section 4.21(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule (the "PICA Reinsurance Treaties"). Except as disclosed in Section
4.21(c) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule, (i) PICA has made available to PRA
complete copies of all of such PICA Reinsurance Treaties and all such PICA
Reinsurance Treaties are in full force and effect, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any party
having the right to terminate a PICA Reinsurance Treaty solely as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) PICA or the
PICA Insurance Subsidiary, as applicable, has received credit for reinsurance
on its most recent PICA SAP Statement, with respect to the reinsurance
provided under each PICA Reinsurance Treaty to which PICA or the PICA
Insurance Subsidiary is the ceding company. The PICA SAP Statements
accurately reflect as of and for the dates indicated therein the extent to
which, pursuant to Insurance Laws, PICA is entitled to take credit for
reinsurance under the PICA Reinsurance Treaties. To the Knowledge of PICA,
all reinsurance recoverable amounts reflected in the PICA SAP Statements are
collectible, and PICA is unaware of any material adverse change in the
financial condition of its reinsurers that might raise concern regarding
their

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

ability to honor their reinsurance commitments, except as set forth in
Section 4.21(c) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule. No party to any of the
PICA Reinsurance Treaties has given written notice to PICA or any PICA
Insurance Subsidiary that such party intends to terminate or cancel any of
the PICA Reinsurance Treaties as a result of or following consummation of the
Plan of Conversion. Assuming due power and authority of, and due
execution by, the other party, each PICA Reinsurance Treaty is valid and
binding on PICA and each applicable PICA Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of
PICA, on the other parties thereto, and none of PICA, any PICA Insurance
Subsidiary, and, to the Knowledge of PICA, any other party thereto, is in
default in any material respect with respect to any such PICA Reinsurance
Treaty. Except as disclosed on Section 4.21(c) of the PICA Disclosure
Schedule, no PICA Reinsurance Treaty contains any provision providing that
the other party thereto may terminate the same solely by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no party to a PICA
Reinsurance Treaty has issued a reservation of rights notice or otherwise
denied or limited coverage (in whole or in part) under any PICA Reinsurance
Treaty. Since December 31, 2007 no PICA Reinsurance Treaty has been canceled
and there has not been any change in the retention level under any of such
PICA Reinsurance Treaties.

 

 

(d) The reserves for the losses and loss adjustment expenses of PICA and each
of the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries ( the "PICA Reserves") reflected in the
PICA SAP Statements as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 (the "June
30, 2008 Statements") were determined in accordance with generally
accepted actuarial methods and standards, consistently applied except as set
forth therein. The insurance reserving practices and policies of PICA
and the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries have not changed, in any material
respect, since June 30, 2008 and the results of the application of such
practices and policies are reflected in the June 30, 2008 Statements. All
reserves of PICA and the PICA Insurance Subsidiaries set forth in the June
30, 2008 Statements were fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial
principles consistently applied and met the requirements of the Insurance
Laws of the applicable Insurance Regulator as of the dates indicated therein.
To the Knowledge of PICA, since June 30, 2008, there has not been any event
or occurrence affecting the reserves of PICA and the PICA Insurance
Subsidiaries that has resulted, or would be reasonably likely to result, in a
Material Adverse Effect on PICA or the PICA Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Subject to confidentiality objections of PICA, PICA has made available to PRA
copies of all internally prepared work papers used as the basis for
establishing the PICA Reserves. Except for regular periodic or special
assessments based on developments that are publicly known within
the insurance industry generally or the medical professional liability
insurance industry, to the Knowledge of PICA, no claim or assessment is
pending or threatened against PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary which is
peculiar or unique to PICA or such PICA Insurance Subsidiary by any state
insurance guaranty association in connection with such association's fund
relating to insolvent insurers.

 

 

(e) Section 4.21(e) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule lists each actuary,
independent or otherwise, that has reviewed, on behalf of PICA or any PICA
Insurance Subsidiary, the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of
PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary, and their premium rates for liability
insurance in each of the years commencing after December 31, 2005
(collectively the "PICA Actuaries" and separately an "PICA Actuary").
Section 4.21(e) of the PICA Disclosure Schedule lists each and every
actuarial report, and all attachments, supplements, addenda and modifications
thereto prepared for or on behalf of PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary by
the PICA Actuaries, or delivered by the PICA Actuaries to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary, since December 31, 2005, in which a
PICA Actuary has (i) either expressed an opinion on the adequacy of reserves
for losses and loss adjustment expenses or made recommendations as to either
the amount of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that should be
maintained by PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary, or (ii) expressed an
opinion as to the adequacy of such premiums or made a recommendation as to
the premiums that should be charged by PICA or any PICA Insurance Subsidiary
for liability insurance (collectively, the "PICA Actuarial Analyses"). To
the Knowledge of PICA, the information and data furnished by PICA to the PICA
Actuaries in connection with the PICA Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all
material respects. To the Knowledge of PICA, each PICA Actuarial Analysis was
based upon an accurate inventory of policies in force for PICA and the PICA
Insurance Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the relevant time of
preparation, was prepared using appropriate modeling procedures accurately
applied and in conformity with generally accepted actuarial principles
consistently applied, and the projections contained therein were properly
prepared in accordance with the assumptions stated therein. PICA has made
available to PRA complete copies of each of the PICA Actuarial Analyses.

 

 

4.22 No Investment Company. Neither PICA nor any PICA Subsidiary is
an "investment company," or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

7.1 Regulatory Matters.

 

 

 

(a) The parties shall promptly make all filings and notifications with, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Authorities that may be or become necessary for their respective execution
and delivery of, and the performance of their respective obligations pursuant
to, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement,
including as set forth in Sections 7.1(b), (c) and (d) below, and shall take
all actions as may be requested by any such Governmental Authorities to

entity of PRA or PICA or any of their Subsidiaries or (ii) any requirement
imposed by a Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected to have
a (A) Material Adverse Effect on PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) material and adverse effect on the aggregate economic value and
business benefits that would reasonably be expected to be obtained by PRA and
its Affiliates from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each
requirement or limitation specified in clauses (i) or (ii) of this paragraph,
a "Burdensome Condition"). Neither PRA nor PICA shall take any action
that they should be reasonably aware would have the effect of delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any required approvals.

commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the Division in
accordance with the requirements of the Illinois Insurance Code: (i) the Plan

following (i) the receipt of the Decision and Order, (ii) the Director's
determination that all conditions to such approval contained in the Decision

and certifying as to whether or not it was approved by not less than two-
thirds of the Eligible Members voting in person or by proxy at the special
meeting and (C) the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of PICA.

 

 

(c) To the extent applicable, PRA shall use commercially reasonable efforts

applicable Insurance Regulators on Form A or on such other form as may be
required by such Insurance Regulators and Applicable Law; (ii) the

or any other forms required by a necessary Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) a

efforts to promptly prepare and file, or cause to be filed, the HSR Act
Report with the Premerger Notification Agencies in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which filing shall comply as to
form with all requirements applicable thereto and all of the data and
information reported therein shall be accurate and complete in all material
respects. Each of PRA and PICA will use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly comply with all requests, if any, of the Premerger Notification
Agencies for additional information or documentation in connection with the
HSR Act Report forms filed by or on behalf of each of such parties pursuant
to the HSR Act, and all such additional information or documentation shall
comply as to form with all requirements applicable thereto and shall be
accurate and complete in all material respects.

 

 

(e) Each party shall provide to the other, (i) promptly after filing thereof,
copies of all statements, applications, correspondence or forms filed by such
party prior to the Closing Date with the Premerger Notification Agencies,
the Insurance Regulators and any other Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) promptly
after delivery to, or receipt from, such regulatory authorities, all
written communications, letters, reports or other documents relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, nothing
contained in this Section 7.1 shall require PICA to provide PRA with any
presentations, board books, work papers or other materials prepared in
support of any appraisal or other valuation analysis of PICA; provided,
further that the party sharing such filing or materials may redact from such
filing and communications any confidential competitive information of such
party and its Affiliates.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Plan of Conversion), and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all such Governmental Authorities. PRA and PICA shall have the right to
review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the
other on, in each case subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to PRA or PICA, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall require PICA
to provide PRA with any presentations, board books, work papers or other
materials prepared in support of any appraisal or other valuation analysis of
PICA; provided, further that the party sharing such filing or materials may
redact from such filing and communications any confidential competitive
information of such party and its Affiliates. The cooperation and
coordination of each party required under this Section 7.1 shall include
giving timely public notice of any public hearings regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and having its representatives attend and
testify at such public hearings. In addition, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(g) PRA and PICA shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information
concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of PRA, PICA or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Plan of Conversion and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries understand and agree that PRA
may be required to include in PRA SEC Reports to be filed prior to
Closing some or all of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in which event
PICA agrees to consent to the inclusion of such financial statements. In
such event, PICA shall also request the independent auditors of PICA to
consent to the inclusion of said financial statements in any registration
statement of PRA that incorporates the financial statements included in such
PRA SEC Report by reference.

 

 

(h) PRA and PICA shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority relating to the consent or
approval from such Governmental Authority that is required for consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(i) PICA and PRA shall use their commercially reasonably efforts to obtain
any other consents and approvals and make any other notifications that may be
required in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that none of PICA, the PICA Subsidiaries or PRA shall be required to
compensate any third party, commence or participate in litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain
any such consent or approval.

 

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither party
shall be required to disclose to the other any of its or its Affiliates,
confidential competitive information and neither party shall be required to
comply with any provision of this Section 7.1 to the extent that such
compliance would be prohibited by Applicable Law.

 

 

7.2 Access to Information.

 

 

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to Applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information and to the Confidentiality Agreement dated May
29, 2008, respectively (the "Confidentiality Agreement") which is hereby
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full
force and effect until Closing, PICA shall, and shall cause each of the PICA
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of PRA, access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Closing Date, to all of its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records. During such period, each of PRA and PICA shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to
the requirements of federal securities laws or Insurance Laws (other than
reports or documents which PRA or PICA, as the case may be, is not permitted
to disclose under Applicable Law or by agreement); provided, however, that
all such access shall be on a basis and follow procedures that the parties
shall mutually agree, and shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the
businesses or operations of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary; provided, further,
that the accountants of PICA will not be obligated to make any work papers
available to PRA unless and until PRA has signed a customary confidentiality
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants. Neither PRA nor PICA nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of PRA's, PICA's, or any PICA Subsidiary\'s, as the case
may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client and work product privileges
of the entity in possession or control of such information or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

 

(b) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
conditions of the other set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

7.3 Recommendation of Eligible Members. PICA will, through its Board of
Directors, subject to its fiduciary obligations as determined by its Board of
Directors, recommend that its Eligible Members vote in favor of the approval
and adoption of the Plan of Conversion.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

7.4 Compliance with Securities Laws. PICA and PRA understand and agree that
the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Plan of Conversion will not be
registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws in
reliance on exemptions from such registration and the certificates
representing such Shares shall bear appropriate legends to such effect. PICA
and PRA shall cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Shares to be issued pursuant to available exemptions
from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws.

 

 

7.5 Employee Plans.

 

 

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending no earlier
than December 31, 2009, PRA shall take any action necessary so that all
individuals who are employed by PICA or a PICA Subsidiary (including
employees who are not actively at work on account of illness, disability or
leave of absence) ("PICA Employees") at the Effective Time and who continue
in employment with PICA, PRA or any of their respective Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time shall continue to receive base wages and salaries at rates
no less favorable to such employee than the rates of wages and salaries paid
by PICA or a PICA Subsidiary to such employee at the Effective Time, so long
as they are employed by PICA, PRA and their Subsidiaries; provided that such
obligations of PRA shall be subject to and conditioned upon compliance with
Section 6.2(h) by PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries with respect to
such Continuing Employee. PICA Employees who continue in employment with PRA
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be referred to herein as
"Continuing Employees." From and after the Effective Time, the PICA Employee
Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement and at the Effective Time
shall remain in effect with respect to the current and former PICA Employees
covered by such PICA Employee Plans at the Effective Time, until at least
December 31, 2009. PRA agrees that it will honor all PICA Employee Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect at the Effective Time, subject to
any amendment or termination thereof that may be required by the plans or
Applicable Law. PRA will review all PICA Employee Plans to determine whether
to maintain, terminate or continue such plans for periods on and after
January 1, 2010. In the event employee benefits as provided by PICA or any
PICA Subsidiary at the Effective Time are changed or terminated by PRA, in
whole or in part for periods on and after January 1, 2010, PRA shall provide
Continuing Employees with benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable to the benefits provided to employees of PRA or applicable PRA
Subsidiary (as of the date any such benefit is provided).

 

 

(b) Employees of PICA or any PICA Subsidiary who become participants in a PRA
Employee Plan shall, for purposes of determining eligibility, benefits
(excluding accruals under a defined benefit plan) and vesting under any such
PRA Employee Plan be given credit for service as an employee of PICA or any
PICA Subsidiary or any predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time as if
such service were with PRA or applicable PRA Subsidiary. PRA shall provide
and recognize, or cause to be provided and recognized, all accrued but unused
vacation of Continuing Employees as of the Effective Time. In the event of
any termination or consolidation of any PICA health plan with any PRA health
plan, PRA shall make available to Continuing Employees and their
dependents employer-provided health coverage on substantially the same basis
as it provides such coverage to PRA employees and shall waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions under such PRA plans with respect to Continuing
Employees and their dependents. In the event of a termination or
consolidation of any PICA health plan, terminated

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

PICA Employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of PRA in accordance with Code
Section 4980B(f). All PICA Employees who cease participating in a PICA
health plan and become participants in a comparable PRA health plan during
any plan year shall receive credit toward the applicable deductible and out-
of-pocket maximums under the PRA health plan for any amounts paid by the
employee under PICA's health plan during the applicable plan year, upon
substantiation, in a form satisfactory to PRA, that such payments have been
made.

 

 

(c) It is understood that PRA and its Subsidiaries are "at-will" employers.
Nothing in this Section 7.5 shall be interpreted as preventing PRA from
terminating the employment of any individual or, except as otherwise provided
in Section 7.5(a) with respect to PICA Employee Plans for periods before
January 1, 2010, from amending, modifying or terminating any PRA Employee
Plans, or any PICA Employee Plans, or any benefits under any PRA Employee
Plans or any PICA Employee Plans, or any other contracts,
arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with their terms
and Applicable Law. In the event that any Continuing Employee is terminated
from employment with PRA or its Subsidiaries as a result of a consolidation
of operations of PICA with PRA, in whole or in part, after the Effective Time
but prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Time, PRA shall provide,
or cause to be provided, to such terminated Continuing Employee severance
benefits equal to at least six, but not more than twelve, months of such
Continuing Employee's compensation based on such Continuing Employee's
position and service with PICA. To the extent not already paid by PICA and
the PICA Subsidiaries, PRA shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Continuing
Employees the bonuses such Continuing Employees have earned or accrued under
the PICA and PICA Subsidiary bonus and incentive compensation programs in
existence as of the Effective Time for the bonus determination period that
includes the Effective Time.

 

 

(d) PRA shall cause PICA or a Subsidiary (i) to offer to continue the
employment of Jerry D. Brant, DPM after the Effective Time under an
employment agreement that will supersede his current employment agreement and
will include the terms that PRA has communicated to him, together with such
other terms as are consistent with the terms of employment of other senior
executives of PRA and (ii) to offer to continue the employment of Messrs.
Adam Wilczek, T. Douglas Webb and Gary Dittman on such terms as PRA has
communicated to them under the terms of the Release and Severance
Compensation Agreements generally offered to other senior executives of PRA
and the Release and Severance Compensation Agreements will supersede their
current employment agreements.

 

 

(e) PRA agrees that PICA shall satisfy any retirement payments or obligations
due to Jerry D. Brant, DPM pursuant to the Employment Agreement dated July
20, 2000, as amended through the date hereof, between Dr. Brant and PICA
prior to the Closing Date. At the Effective Time, PICA shall credit current
participants in the Executive Retention and Deferred Compensation Plan dated
January 1, 2007 of PICA (the "Retention Plan") with all amounts that would
otherwise be credited to their accounts in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and accelerate
the vesting of all benefits for the current participants under the Retention
Plan. PICA shall pay the total accrued benefits under the Retention Plan to
each of the current participants promptly, but in any event no later than 60
days, after the Effective Time.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, PRA agrees that PRA will
assume, maintain and honor, or cause to be assumed, maintained and honored,
the Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the terms of
such plan as in effect at the Effective Time for a period ending no earlier
than 48 months after the Effective Time; provided that PRA shall have the
right to terminate employer matching contributions to former directors of
PICA who have entered into a Consulting Agreement under such plan. PRA
further agrees that it shall not terminate such plan, nor take any other
action to cause benefits to be distributed from such plan, prior to the date
all benefits are payable to participants in the plan in accordance with the
terms of the plan and participant elections as in effect on the date which is
48 months after the Effective Time.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all payments made to
PICA Employees under this Section 7.5 shall be subject to withholding
required by applicable federal, state and local taxing authorities.

 

 

7.6 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) PICA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, prior to the
Effective Time, to purchase a single payment, run-off or "tail" insurance
policy or policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
current and former officers and directors of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries
on terms and conditions, including limits, no less favorable than their
respective directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement, such policy or policies to become effective at the
Effective Time and remain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time (the "Tail Policy") with respect to directors' and officers'
liability for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior
to the Effective Time. If PICA is unable to obtain the Tail Policy prior to
Closing, PRA shall use its best efforts to cause the individuals serving as
officers and directors of PICA and the PICA Subsidiaries, immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if
longer) by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained
by PICA or the PICA Subsidiary (provided that PRA may substitute therefor
policies of the same or substantially similar coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions which are not less advantageous in any material respect
than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event shall the premium for
any such insurance be more than 300% of the current amount expended by PICA
or the PICA Subsidiary (the "Insurance Premium Amount"); and provided
further, that if PRA is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for
by this Section 7.6, PRA shall use its best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as available for the Insurance Premium Amount.

 

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time (unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law), the charter and bylaws of PICA and the PICA
Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the
exculpation of, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors,
officers, employees and agents than those set forth in the Amended and
Restated Articles and Amended and Restated Bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of PICA (or the relevant Subsidiary) as in effect
on the date hereof; provided, however, that if any claim or claims are
asserted against any individual entitled to the protections

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

of such provisions within such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
modified until the final disposition of any such claims. In addition to
the obligations set forth in Section 7.6(a), PRA shall, and shall cause PICA
to, exculpate, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the
Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent of PICA or a PICA
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorney's fees), liabilities fines, obligations,
or judgments or amounts (collectively "Losses") that are paid in settlement
of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative
(formal or informal) (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or
is threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of PICA or a PICA Subsidiary if such
Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at
or before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Plan of
Conversion and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed on, before, or after,
the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent
provided under, the Amended and Restated Articles and Amended and Restated
Bylaws or in the organizational documents of any PICA Subsidiary or PRA, as
applicable, any indemnification agreement or under Applicable Law. PRA shall
pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent provided in the
Amended and Restated Articles and Applicable Law. The Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with PRA;
provided, however, that (A) PRA shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and upon such assumption PRA shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if PRA fails to promptly assume such defense the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to him after
consultation with PRA, and PRA shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Party, (B) PRA shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties except to the extent representation by a single firm or attorney is,
in the absence of an informed consent by the Indemnified Party, prohibited by
ethical rules relating to lawyers' conflicts of interest, (C) PRA shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (D) PRA shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated by this Agreement is prohibited
by Applicable Law and (E) PRA shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party for which and to the extent payment is actually and
unqualifiedly made in the full amount of all such Losses for which
indemnification has been sought to such Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy, any other agreement for indemnification or otherwise. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 7.6, upon learning
of any such Claim, shall notify PRA thereof, provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of PRA under this Section 7.6 except
to the extent such failure to notify prejudices PRA by depriving PRA of the
reasonable opportunity to investigate and assume the defense of the claim.
PRA's obligations under this Section 7.6 continue in full force and effect
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (or the period of the
applicable statute of limitations, if longer); provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

7.7 Advice of Changes.

 

 

(a) Each party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
the other party a written disclosure schedule as to any matter of which it
becomes aware following execution of this Agreement which would constitute a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement by such
party, identifying on such disclosure schedule the representation, warranty
or covenant which would be so breached. If disclosure of a matter which
would constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of
this Agreement is made by either party, the nondisclosing party shall have
the right, in its discretion, to terminate this Agreement to the extent such
termination is permitted under Section 9.1 of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) PICA shall update the PICA Disclosure Schedule (the "Closing Date PICA
Disclosure Schedule") to a date that is no earlier than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date and no later than seven (7) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date and shall deliver the Closing Date PICA Disclosure
Schedule to PRA not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. The obligation of PICA to deliver to PRA the Closing Date PICA
Disclosure Schedule shall be a material obligation for purposes of Section
8.2(a) hereof.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.7 and any notices by PRA on the one
hand, and PICA on the other, shall not be deemed in any way to constitute a
waiver by the counterparty of the conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof or
any of its remedies under Article 9 hereof, nor shall any such notices cure
any breach of any representation or warranty which is inaccurate.

 

 

7.8 Additional Agreements.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, PICA shall provide to PRA (i) within forty-
five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter, a copy of the
quarterly unaudited statutory statements of PICA and each of the PICA
Insurance Subsidiaries filed with the Insurance Regulator of the jurisdiction
of domicile of PICA or the applicable PICA Insurance Subsidiary, as
applicable, as of and for such quarter end and all exhibits, schedules and
notes attached thereto or provided therewith and (ii) within sixty (60) days
after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the statutory annual statements

Insurance Subsidiary, as applicable, as of and for such year end and all
exhibits, schedules and notes attached thereto and provided therewith.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, PRA shall provide PICA promptly after filing
with the SEC the periodic and current reports filed by PRA pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act together with any financial statements

(a) Subject to Section 7.9(b), so long as this Agreement remains in effect
and no notice of termination has been given under this Agreement, PICA shall
not authorize or knowingly permit any of its representatives, directly or
indirectly, to initiate, entertain, solicit, encourage, engage in, or
participate in, negotiations with any Person or any group of Persons other
than the other party to this Agreement or any of its Affiliates (a "Potential
Acquiror") concerning any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in this Section
7.9) other than as expressly provided in this Agreement. PICA will promptly
inform PRA of any bona fide inquiry it receives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall furnish the information required in
Section 7.9(b).

 

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of PICA from either furnishing information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, any Person or group of Persons regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, or approving and recommending to the Eligible Members
of PICA an Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, if the
Board of Directors of PICA determines in good faith that such action is
appropriate in furtherance of the best interests of the Members. In
connection with any such determination, (i) PICA shall direct its
representatives, officers and other appropriate personnel to cooperate with
and be reasonably available to consult with any such Person, or group of
Persons, (ii) PICA will disclose to PRA that it is furnishing information to,
or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person or group of
Persons, which disclosure shall describe the terms thereof (but need not
identify the Person, or group of Persons making the offer), (iii) prior to
furnishing such information to such Person or group of Persons, PICA shall
enter into a written agreement with such Person or group of Persons which
provides for, among other things, (A) the furnishing to PICA of information
regarding such Person or group of Persons that is relevant to its ability to
finance and otherwise perform its obligations under its Acquisition Proposal;
(B) the confidentiality of all non-public information furnished to such
Person or group of Persons by PICA; and (C) procedures
reasonably satisfactory to PICA that are designed to restrict or limit the
provision of information regarding PICA that could be used to the competitive
disadvantage of PICA or PRA; (iv) PICA will not furnish any non-public
information regarding PRA or the transactions contemplated hereby; and (v)
PICA will keep PRA informed of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations (provided that PICA shall not be required to disclose to PRA
confidential information concerning the business or operations of such Person
or group of Persons).

 

 

(c) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal
pursuant to which any Person or group of Persons, other than PRA or PICA,
would acquire or participate in a merger, consolidation, or other business
combination involving PICA or any of the PICA Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly; (ii) any proposal by which any Person or group of Persons,
other than PRA or PICA, would acquire a substantial equity interest in PICA
or any of the PICA Subsidiaries, including the right to vote 10% or more of
the capital stock (following a reorganization or conversion) of PICA or any
of the PICA Subsidiaries entitled to vote thereon for the election of
directors; (iii) any acquisition of 10% or more of the assets of PICA or any
of the PICA Subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of business; (iv)

representation and warranty shall have been true and correct as of such
specific date); provided, however, that if the failure of any such

the foregoing condition shall be deemed to have been fulfilled, and PRA shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of PICA by the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of PICA to such effect;

following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which
breach, by its nature or timing, cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date,

of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither PRA nor PICA shall be relieved
or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach
of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 

9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Subject to the

at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection
with the Plan of Conversion and this Agreement by the Eligible Members of
PICA; provided, however, that after any approval of the Plan of Conversion

PICA, there may not be, without further approval of such Eligible Members,
any amendment of this Agreement which changes or otherwise modifies or amends
the (i) amount of the Purchase Price, (ii) the form of the consideration to

of the other parties to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that after any

Agreement or any portion thereof which changes or otherwise modifies or
amends the (i) amount of the Purchase Price, (ii) the form of the
consideration to be delivered to the Eligible Members and DR Former Members
of PICA under this Agreement, (iii) the Conversion Credits, or (iv) any other
term contained in the Plan of Conversion. Any agreement on the part of a
party to this Agreement to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

 

9.5 Liquidated Damages; Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that any of the
following events or circumstances shall occur, PICA shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after notice of the occurrence thereof by PRA, pay to PRA the
sum equal to $4,050,000 (which the parties agree and stipulate as reasonable

of PRA in the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and is not a
penalty or forfeiture): (i) PRA shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(d) or (e); (ii) PICA shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(h); or (iii) if the Eligible Members of PICA fail to hold the
meeting of the Eligible Members of PICA as required by Section 1.2 of this
Agreement within 120 days after the Director issues his Decision and Order
approving the Plan of Conversion and the Information Statement. For purposes
of this Agreement a "PICA Acquisition Event" shall mean that PICA shall have
authorized, recommended, approved, or entered into an agreement with any
Person (other than any of the parties to this Agreement) to effect an
Acquisition Proposal. Upon the making and receipt of such payment under this
Section 9.5, PICA shall have no further obligation of any kind under this
Agreement and PRA shall not have any further obligation of any kind under
this Agreement, except in each case under Section 9.2 of this Agreement, and
no party shall have any liability for any breach or alleged breach by such
party of any provision of this Agreement.

10.6 Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative. Each party acknowledges and

the other party hereto and that neither party will have an adequate remedy
at law. Therefore, the obligations of PICA and PRA under this
Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by
any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any
other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

10.7 Presumptions. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that all parties

any party on the ground that such party was responsible for preparing this
Agreement or any part of it.

 

 

10.8 Exhibits and Schedules. Each of the Exhibits and Schedules referred to
in, and/or attached to, this Agreement is an integral part of this Agreement
and is incorporated in this Agreement by this reference.

 

 

10.9 Interpretation; Conflict. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of
or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require
PRA, PICA or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any
action which would violate any Applicable Law, rule or regulation. In the
event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of
Conversion, the terms of the Plan of Conversion shall control.

 

 

10.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

 

10.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and

the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

 

10.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
any applicable conflicts of law principles, except that the Plan of
Conversion shall be effected in accordance with and governed by the laws of

they relate to PICA shall govern to the extent the application of such laws
would be inconsistent with or in contravention of the laws of the State of
Delaware.

 

 

10.13 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

 

10.14 Publicity. PRA and PICA shall develop a joint communications plan and
each party shall (i) ensure that all press releases and other public
statements and communications with

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consistent with such joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of the NYSE, consult with each other for a reasonable
time before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement or communication (including any communications that would require a
filing with the SEC), and mutually agree upon any such press release or any
such public statement or communication, with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE, neither PRA nor PICA shall issue

concerning the other party or the other party's business, financial

the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Sections
2.9, 3.2(b), 3.2(d) and 7.6, this Agreement (including the documents and

CONSULTING, CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT

 

 

THIS CONSULTING, CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT ("Agreement")
is made and entered into as of the [first day of month after Closing], by and
between ProAssurance Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("ProAssurance"), and _____________________(the "Consultant").

 

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

 

WHEREAS, ProAssurance desires to retain Consultant for the period set forth
in this Agreement to obtain services from the Consultant, and Consultant is
willing to be retained by ProAssurance pursuant to this Agreement; and

 

 

WHEREAS, Consultant acknowledges (i) that Consultant's expertise will
contribute significantly to the financial success of the business of
ProAssurance and (ii) that the compensation, covenants not to compete and
confidentiality provisions in this Agreement are reasonable.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, as well as for other good
and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged), the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

 

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of __________________, by and among ProAssurance, and Podiatry Insurance Company of America ("PICA").

 

 

2. Consulting Relationship. ProAssurance hereby retains Consultant to provide Consulting Services (as defined in Section 3 of this Agreement) for a term commencing on the date hereof (the "Effective Date") and ending on that date that is the earlier of the date this Agreement is terminated and ______________, 2013 [48 month after the Effective Date] (the "Expiration Date").

 

 

3. Consulting Services. Consultant agrees to provide such services to ProAssurance as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of PICA or ProAssurance, consistent with Consultant's skills, background and experience. Consultant shall not be required to devote a specific amount of time each year to the performance of his duties, but shall spend that amount of time reasonably necessary to accomplish the assigned tasks (including Board, advisory board and committee service) faithfully and completely. The services of Consultant as described above are collectively defined as the "Consulting Services."

 

 

 

4. Compensation.

 

 

a. In consideration of Consultant's Consulting Services and Consultant's
covenants regarding confidentiality and noncompetition, ProAssurance shall
pay Consultant: (i)


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

a fee at closing of $ 50,000; and (ii) a consulting fee payable in
47 consecutive monthly installments of $5,200 each and one final
installment of $5,600, with such installments commencing on the Effective
Date and payable on the first day of each of the next consecutive 47 fiscal
months thereafter (the "Consulting Fee").

 

 

b. ProAssurance shall reimburse Consultant, within 30 days after Consultant
submits expense receipts to ProAssurance, for all reasonable out-of-pocket
travel expenses that are paid by Consultant in performing the Consulting
Services, in accordance with the reimbursement policies adopted from time to
time by ProAssurance.

 

 

c. It is understood and agreed that Consultant is responsible for all
tax payments. If ProAssurance, in its sole discretion, shall determine that
ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries has incurred or will incur
any liability to withhold any federal, state or local income or other taxes
by reason of any remuneration payable to Consultant, then ProAssurance may
effect such withholding.

 



 

d. With respect to any compensation paid pursuant to this
Agreement, Consultant shall be permitted to defer compensation pursuant to
the terms of the PICA Deferred Compensation Plan; provided that neither PICA
nor ProAssurance nor any of their respective subsidiaries shall make a
matching contribution with respect to the compensation payable to Consultant
under this Agreement.

 

5. Right of Employment. Neither this Agreement nor any action taken or not taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as giving Consultant any right to be retained, as an employee or otherwise, by ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries.

 

 

 

6. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as follows:

 

 

a. This Agreement shall terminate one day after Consultant's death.

 

 

b. ProAssurance may terminate this Agreement if, by reason of a disability,
Consultant has been unable to perform Consulting Services for a period of 180
consecutive days. For purposes of this Agreement, "disability" means a
serious injury or illness that requires Consultant to be under regular care
of a licensed medical physician and renders the Consultant incapable of
performing the essential function of this Agreement as determined by the
Board of Directors of PICA in good faith and upon receipt of and in reliance
on competent medical advice from one or more individuals selected by the
Board, who are qualified to give professional medical advice. Consultant will
submit to such medical or psychiatric examinations and tests as such medical
professional deems necessary to make any determination of Consultant's
disability and consent to such medical professional sharing the results of
such examination with a representative of the Board.

 

 

c. If Consultant is a Podiatric Physician, ProAssurance may terminate this
Agreement if Consultant fails to be an insured of PICA or a ProAssurance
subsidiary; provided that this section shall not apply if the Consultant is
no longer actively engaged in the private practice of Podiatric Medicine.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

d. ProAssurance may terminate this Agreement for Cause at any time. For
purposes of this Agreement "Cause" shall mean, and this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause if such termination results from,
(i) willful gross misconduct on the part of Consultant that is materially and
demonstrably injurious to ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries as
determined by the Board of Directors of ProAssurance; provided however, that
no act, or failure to act, on the part of Consultant shall be considered
willful gross misconduct unless Consultant acted, or failed to act, other
than in good faith and with a reasonable belief that such action, or failure
to act, was in the best interest of ProAssurance and its subsidiaries; or
(ii) Consultant commits any act that constitutes a felony and that results,
or is intended to result, directly or indirectly, in Consultant's substantial
personal gain or personal enrichment at the expense of ProAssurance or any of
its subsidiaries.

 

 

e. Consultant may terminate this Agreement with cause or without cause at
any time.

 

 



 

Except for termination upon the death of the Consultant, any termination of
this Agreement by ProAssurance, or by Consultant, shall be communicated by
Notice of Termination to the other party given in accordance with Section
18 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" is
a written notice which indicates the specific termination provision in
this Agreement relied upon. The "Date of Termination" means (i) if this
Agreement is terminated by reason of death of the Consultant, the date of
death shall be the Date of Termination; (ii) if this Agreement is terminated
by reason of Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of
determination of Disability by the board of directors of ProAssurance; (iii)
if this Agreement is terminated by ProAssurance other than for death or
Disability , the Date of Termination shall be the date of receipt of the
Notice of Termination by Consultant; or (iv) if this Agreement is terminated
by Consultant for any reason other than death, the Date of Termination shall
be date of receipt of the Notice of Termination by ProAssurance.

 

 

7. Compensation Upon Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6, ProAssurance shall have no further obligation under this Agreement to make any payments to Consultant or to bestow any benefits on Consultant after the Termination Date, other than payments and benefits accrued and due and payable to Consultant prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the death or Disability of the Consultant, ProAssurance will pay monthly installments that would otherwise be due to Consultant pursuant to Section 4 from the Date of Termination to the Expiration Date. Such payment will be made in a lump sum within thirty days after the Date of Termination; and, in the event of death, the payment will be made to the estate of Consultant.

 

 

 

8. Confidentiality.

 

 

a. Consultant acknowledges (i) that as a result of Consultant's prior service
as a director of PICA and Consultant's engagement by
ProAssurance, Consultant has and will become informed of, and has had and
will have access to, valuable and confidential information of ProAssurance
and its subsidiaries including, but not limited to, trade secrets, technical
information, know-how, plans, specifications, marketing and sales
information, claims handling


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

information, investment information, and the identity of policyholders and
reinsurers (collectively, "Confidential Information"), (ii) that the
Confidential Information is the exclusive property of ProAssurance and its
subsidiaries, and (iii) that the Confidential Information is to be held by
Consultant in trust and solely for the benefit of ProAssurance and
its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Consultant shall not at any time subsequent
to the date of this Agreement, use, reveal, report, publish, transfer or
otherwise disclose to any person or entity any of the
Confidential Information without the prior consent of ProAssurance, except to
officers and employees of ProAssurance and its subsidiaries, and other
persons or entities whom ProAssurance agrees are in a contractual or
fiduciary relationship with ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries. This
provision does not prohibit Consultant from disclosing information which
legally is or becomes of general public knowledge from authorized sources
other than Consultant.

 

 

b. If the Confidential Information known to Consultant or in Consultant's
possession is subpoenaed, is subject to a demand for production, or is
subject to any other form of legal process, by any judicial, regulatory,
administrative, legislative or governmental authority, or any other person or
entity, Consultant agrees to notify ProAssurance promptly that such subpoena,
demand or other legal process has been received. Consultant agrees to use
Consultant's best efforts, consistent with the requirements of applicable
law, to protect the Confidential Information from disclosure and to cooperate
with ProAssurance and its subsidiaries in seeking protection from disclosure
of the Confidential Information. If Consultant is required to disclose the
Confidential Information, Consultant agrees, at ProAssurance's request and
expense, to use Consultant's best efforts to obtain assurances that the
Confidential Information will be maintained on a confidential basis and not
be disclosed to a greater degree than legally required.

 

 

c. Upon the termination of this Agreement, Consultant shall promptly deliver
to ProAssurance all originals and all copies that are in Consultant's
possession or control of the following: all customer lists, stockholder
lists, lists of names of beneficial owners, policyholder lists, manuals,
letters, notes, notebooks, reports and all other materials relating to the
business of ProAssurance and its subsidiaries. Consultant shall represent to
ProAssurance that Consultant has complied with the provisions of this Section
8 at the time the Consultant ceases to be a consultant to ProAssurance.

 

 

9. Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation.

 

 

a. During the term of this Agreement and until the Expiration Date,
Consultant agrees that Consultant shall not, directly or indirectly, engage,
participate, or assist in any business organization by performing services
related to the providing of malpractice insurance to podiatric physicians,
chiropractors and other persons or entities insured by PICA or any of its
subsidiaries (the "Proscribed Activities") in the states in which PICA or any
of its subsidiaries is then conducting the Proscribed Activities, whether as
owner, part-owner, stockholder, partner, director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, consultant or in any other capacity, on Consultant's own
behalf or on behalf of any person or entity. Consultant may make passive
investments in a competitive enterprise of which the voting equity interests
are publicly traded, provided that Consultant's holdings in such enterprise,
together with the holdings of any


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

of the Consultant's affiliates (as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the
Rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) do not exceed 3%
of the outstanding voting equity interests of such enterprise.

 

 

b. During the term of this Agreement and until the Expiration Date,
Consultant agrees that Consultant shall not (i) directly or indirectly
solicit any person or entity in the states in which PICA or any of its
subsidiaries is then conducting the Proscribed Activities to purchase
insurance products or services competitive with the Proscribed Activities,
(ii) directly or indirectly solicit any person or entity to purchase or sell
insurance products or services relating to the Proscribed Activities, or
(iii) recruit or otherwise solicit or induce any person who is at the time an
employee or consultant with ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries to
terminate such person's employment or consulting relationship with
ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries.

 

 



 

10. Restrictions Reasonable. The restrictions against competition and solicitation set forth above are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purposes of protecting the business of ProAssurance and its subsidiaries. If any restriction is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time, or over too broad a range of activities, or in too large a geographic area, then that restriction shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, or range of activities, or geographic area, as to which it may be enforceable.

 

 

11. Remedies. Consultant and ProAssurance acknowledge that ProAssurance and its subsidiaries would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages if the covenants contained in Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement were not complied with in accordance with their terms. Because the breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants in Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement will result in immediate and irreparable injury to ProAssurance and its subsidiaries, Consultant agrees that ProAssurance and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to an injunction restraining Consultant from violating Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement to the fullest extent allowed by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit ProAssurance or any of its subsidiaries from pursuing all other legal or equitable remedies that may be available to it for a breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.

 

 

12. Resignation from PICA Board of Directors. Consultant hereby resigns as director and officer, if applicable, of PICA and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, effective upon the Effective Time as defined and contemplated under the Stock Purchase Agreement. This resignation shall not require acceptance by PICA or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, and shall take effect automatically upon the Effective Time without any further action on behalf of the Consultant or PICA or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries.

 

 

13. Survival. The provisions of Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 18(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of ProAssurance, its successors and assigns, and the provisions of Section 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of the Consultant, and its heirs, representative, successors and assigns.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

14. Third-Party Agreements and Rights. Consultant confirms that Consultant is not bound by any agreement with any other person or entity that would restrict engagement of Consultant in any business or Consultant's use or disclosure of information. Consultant represents that Consultant's execution of this Agreement, engagement by ProAssurance and performance of duties pursuant to this Agreement will not violate any obligations Consultant may have to any other person or entity. Consultant shall not disclose or make use of information in violation of any agreements with or rights of any other person or entity.

 

 

15. Further Assurances. Consultant and ProAssurance agree to execute, acknowledge, deliver and file, or cause to be executed, acknowledged, delivered and filed, all further instruments, agreements or documents as may be necessary to consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement and to do all further acts necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

 

 

16. No Waiver. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel against the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement, except by written instrument of the party charged with the waiver or estoppel. No written waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and each waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of the term or condition for the future or as to any act other than that specifically waived. The waiver by a party of any other party's breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach, and the failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy shall not operate or be construed as a waiver or bar to the exercise of such right or remedy upon the occurrence of any subsequent breach. No delay on the part of a party in exercising a right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver on the part of a party of a right, power or privilege, or a single or partial exercise of a right, power or privilege, shall preclude further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies of this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of the rights or remedies that a party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

 

 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to its conflicts of law principles.

 

 

18. Notices. Notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (with confirmation), mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), or delivered by an express courier (with confirmation), to the parties at the addresses below (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

b. If to Consultant:

 

 

19. Assignment.

 

 

a. This Agreement and all of Consultant's rights, duties and obligations
under this Agreement are personal in nature and shall not be assignable by
the Consultant. A purported assignment shall not be valid or binding
on ProAssurance.

 

 

b. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be legally binding upon
all successors and assigns of ProAssurance. ProAssurance will require
a successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets
of ProAssurance by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Consultant, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the
same manner and to the same extent that ProAssurance would be required to
perform it if no such succession had taken place. For purposes of this
Section 18, "ProAssurance" shall mean ProAssurance as defined above and all
successors to its business or assets that execute and deliver the agreement
provided for in this Section 18 or that otherwise become bound by the terms
and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

 

 



 

20. Attorneys' Fees. If litigation is brought concerning this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the non-prevailing party, and the non-prevailing party shall upon final judgment and the expiration of all appeals immediately pay upon demand all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the prevailing party.

 

 

21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument properly executed by Consultant and ProAssurance.

 

 

22. Severability. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a mutually acceptable valid, legal and enforceable provision which comes closest to the intent of the parties.

 

 

23. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
