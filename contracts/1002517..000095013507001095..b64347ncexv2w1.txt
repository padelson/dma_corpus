and among Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"),
Beryllium Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned

amended (the "CODE"). Parent and the Company intend that the First Step
Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute integrated steps in a
single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the parties adopt by
executing this Agreement.   C. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among
other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company (other than the
Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth herein.   D. A portion of the
consideration payable in connection with the First Step Merger shall be
placed in escrow as security for the indemnification obligations set forth in
this Agreement.   E. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Subs,
on the other hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in connection with the Integrated Merger.  
F. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
a material inducement to Parent and the Subs to enter into this Agreement,
all officers and directors of the Company, and certain stockholders of the
Company are entering into Voting Agreements, in substantially the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "VOTING AGREEMENTS"), with
Parent,    pursuant to which such stockholders have irrevocably agreed to
vote in favor of the Integrated Merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby and to other matters set forth therein, and all employees of the
Company who own three percent (3%) or more of the Total Outstanding Shares
(as defined in SECTION 1.6(a)) are entering into Employee Proprietary
Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreements, each in substantially
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B-1 and all other employees of the
Company who accept employment with the Final Surviving Entity are entering
into Employee Proprietary Information, Inventions and Non-Competition
Agreements, each in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B-2
(collectively the "EMPLOYEE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INVENTIONS AND NON-
COMPETITION AGREEMENTS"), with Parent or the Final Surviving Entity, as
determined by Parent.   G. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent and the Subs to enter into
this Agreement, the persons listed on EXHIBIT H are entering into offer
letters with Parent.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
agreements, covenants and other promises set forth herein, the mutual

otherwise replaced by Parent. Each Company Vested Option which is unexercised
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall in accordance
with its terms and by virtue of the First Step Merger and without any action
on the part of the Parent, the Subs, the Company or the holder thereof,
terminate and cease to be outstanding (each such terminated Company Vested
Option shall be referred to as a "CANCELLED OPTION").   (ii) Holders of
Cancelled Options shall be given the opportunity (of not more than 30 days)
to decline to accept a modification of such Cancelled Option such that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger, the holder of each Cancelled Option shall be deemed to have
exercised such Cancelled Option pursuant to a net exercise program whereby
the holder will be deemed to have paid the aggregate exercise price for such
Cancelled Option by relinquishing that number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such option in an amount necessary to pay the applicable
aggregate exercise price and any applicable withholding taxes associated with
such net exercise of such Cancelled Option. The number of shares of Company
Common Stock deemed delivered to the holder of each Cancelled Option pursuant
to this net exercise program shall be determined by subtracting the
Net Exercise Consideration (as defined below) from the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Cancelled Option. The holder of each
such Cancelled Option shall thereafter (A) participate in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the same manner, and to the same extent, as
if such holder owned that number of shares of Company Common Stock delivered
after the net exercise, pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(d)(ii) and (B) receive,
if applicable, the Fractional Share Payment (as defined in SECTION
1.6(d)(vi)). As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide to each holder of any Company Vested
Option an informational notice and consent describing the treatment of such
Cancelled Options pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(d)(ii).   (iii) With respect
to each Company Unvested Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole discretion and pursuant to a
written election of Parent made prior to the Closing, agree to either (A)
assume such Company Unvested Option in accordance with the terms set forth
below in this SECTION 1.6(d)(iii) or (B) cause all such Company Unvested
Options to accelerate and terminate in accordance with their respective terms
(each referred to herein as a "CASHED-OUT OPTION") and Parent will make a
cash payment to the holder of each such Cashed Out Option in an amount equal
to (x) the number of shares of Company   -15-   Common Stock underlying
each Company Unvested Option held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share Participating Closing
Consideration and minus (z) the Aggregate Unvested Option Exercise Price. If
Parent elects to assume all Company Unvested Options, (i) each such assumed
Company Unvested Option shall thereby be converted into an option (an
"ASSUMED OPTION") to purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Unvested Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Closing Exchange Ratio (as
defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the per share exercise price of the Company
Unvested Option immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Closing Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Except as modified by the
Employee Retention Agreements required to be executed pursuant to SECTION
5.15 hereof, each Assumed Option shall otherwise retain the terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) of the Company Unvested Option.  
(iv) On the first Business Day after the occurrence of the Earnout Payment
Date (the "EARNOUT ADJUSTMENT DATE"):   (1) each holder of an Assumed Option
as of the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive either, at Parent\'s
sole discretion pursuant to a written election of Parent delivered to the
Stockholder Representative, (A) a cash payment from Parent in an amount equal
to such holder\'s Unvested Option Earnout Value or (B) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to such holder\'s Unvested Option Earnout Value
divided by (ii) the Earnout Price, rounded down to the nearest whole share
(with any fractional share amount paid in cash by Parent) (such amount in (A)
or (B) the "OPTION EARNOUT PAYMENT").   (2) each former holder of a Cashed-
Out Option (if and as applicable) shall be entitled to receive either, at
Parent\'s sole discretion pursuant to a written election of Parent delivered
to the Stockholder Representative, (A) a cash payment from Parent in an
amount equal to such holder\'s Unvested Option Earnout Value or (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (i) such holder\'s Unvested
Option Earnout Value divided by (ii) the Earnout Price, rounded down to the
nearest whole share (with any fractional share amount paid in cash by
Parent); provided that the right to receive any Option Earnout Payment shall
be subject to vesting over the vesting schedule as applied to the Assumed
Option as of the Effective Time and the pro rata portion of the Option
Earnout Payment shall not be paid prior to the applicable vesting date.  
(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 1.6(d), the
receipt of the Earnout Consideration with respect to any Company Vested
Option and the receipt of any Option Earnout Payment shall be limited by and
subject to the restrictions imposed by the Employee Retention
Agreements required to be executed pursuant to SECTION 5.15 of this
Agreement.   (vi) For the purposes of this Section 1.6(d):   -16-   
(1) "CLOSING EXCHANGE RATIO" shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing (A)
the Per Share Assumed Option Closing Consideration by (B) the Closing
Price.   (2) "EARNOUT PRICE" shall mean the average of the reported closing
price per share of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) Business Days
immediately preceding the Earnout Adjustment Date.   (3) "FRACTIONAL SHARE
PAYMENT" shall mean a payment in cash determined by multiplying (A) the
fractional share of Company Common Stock which was not required to be paid
but was nevertheless forfeited as required by the rounding convention in the
definition of "Net Exercise Consideration" by (B) the Per Share Participating
Closing Consideration.   (4) "NET EXERCISE CONSIDERATION" shall mean that
number of shares of Company Common Stock determined by dividing (A) the sum
of the total aggregate exercise price of the Cancelled Options and the amount
of the appropriate tax withholdings by (B) the Per Share Participating
Closing Consideration and then rounding that quotient up to the next whole
share.   (5) "PER SHARE ASSUMED OPTION CLOSING CONSIDERATION" shall mean
the sum of (A) the Per Share Participating Stock Closing Consideration
divided by the Signing Price and multiplied by the Closing Price plus (B) the
Per Share Participating Cash Closing Consideration.   (6) "PER SHARE EARNOUT
ALLOCATION" shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Earned
Earnout Amount by (y) the Total Outstanding Shares.   (7) "UNVESTED OPTION
EARNOUT VALUE" shall mean (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying each Company Unvested Option held by a holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Earnout Allocation.  
(vii) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of the Plan or
the terms of any Company Option agreement, the Company shall, prior to the
Effective Time, (i) provide any notices to and obtain any consents from
holders of Company Options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity
incentive plans or arrangements, to give effect to the provisions of this
SECTION 1.6(d). It is intended that the assumption of the Company Unvested
Options by Parent shall comply with Section 424 of the Code and shall also be
considered by Parent and the Company to be in good faith compliance with
respect to Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall take no action, other
than those actions contemplated by this Agreement, which will cause or result
in the accelerated vesting of the Company Unvested Options. As soon as
practicable after each of the Effective Time and the Earnout Payment Date,
Parent shall deliver to the holder of each Company Option appropriate notices
setting forth the number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying such
Assumed Option then held by each such holder and the exercise price under
each such Assumed Option, each as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 5.15.  
-17-    (viii) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for
the assumption of the Company Options pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(d),
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this SECTION 1.6(d).
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Company
as promptly as practicable and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the Effective Time and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such Company
Options for so long as such Company Options remain outstanding.   (e)
TREATMENT OF COMPANY WARRANTS. The Company shall take all necessary actions
(including providing all required notices) to ensure that all outstanding
Company Warrants are terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent and the Company shall take all action necessary to permit each holder
of a Company Warrant to exchange such Company Warrant (in lieu of exercising
it) and receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares
of Company Capital Stock for which the Company Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, net of the aggregate
exercise price payable under such Company Warrant and any applicable
withholding taxes.   (f) WITHHOLDING TAXES. Parent, the Company, the Subs,
and the Exchange Agent (as defined in SECTION 1.9) shall have the right to
deduct and withhold Taxes (as defined in SECTION 2.11) from any payments to
be made hereunder (including with respect to the Earned Earnout Amount, if
any) if such withholding is required by law and to request any necessary Tax
forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar information, from the Stockholders and any other
recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been delivered and paid to the Stockholder or other recipient of
payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that any
Earnout Consideration paid to holders of vested stock or stock for which a
Section 83(b) election has been made is intended to be consideration for
shares of capital stock of the Company, rather than compensation for
services, and none of Parent, the Company, the Subs and the Exchange Agent
(as defined in SECTION 1.9) shall withhold Taxes from any such payment of the
Earnout Consideration on the basis that such payment is compensation for
services unless Parent has received an opinion from nationally recognized tax
counsel that as a result of a pronouncement of law published after the
Closing Date in a source allowable as "substantial authority" under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6662-4(d)(iii), no "reasonable basis" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6662-3(b)(3) exists for treating
such payment of the Earnout Consideration as consideration for shares of
capital stock of the Company.   (g) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUBS. Each share of
Common Stock of Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Interim Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub I evidencing ownership of any such
shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock
of the Interim Surviving Corporation. Each share of Common Stock of the
Interim Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately  
-18-   after the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for
the applicable corresponding interest of the Final Surviving Entity. Each
stock certificate of the Interim Surviving Corporation evidencing ownership
of any such shares shall continue to evidence the applicable corresponding
interest in the Final Surviving Entity.   1.7 DISSENTING SHARES.   (a)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has not voted for the
Merger and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
Delaware Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder\'s
appraisal rights under Delaware Law (collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES")
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable
consideration for Company Common Stock set forth in SECTION 1.6 hereof, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by
Delaware Law.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 1.7(a) hereof,
if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder\'s appraisal rights
under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration for
Company Common Stock, as applicable, set forth in SECTION 1.6 hereof, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares.   (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any
such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or the
Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares
in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in
respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any
other costs or expenses, (including specifically, but without limitation,
attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses in connection with any action or
proceeding or in connection with any investigation) in respect of any
Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) (together "DISSENTING
SHARE PAYMENTS"). Dissenting Share Payments paid or incurred prior to Closing
Date are referred to herein as "PRE-CLOSING DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS" and
shall be deducted from the Closing Consideration as provided in SECTION
1.6(a)(VI). Dissenting Share Payments paid or incurred after the Closing Date
are referred to herein as "POST-CLOSING DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS" which
Parent shall be entitled to recover under the terms of Section 7.2
hereof.   1.8 PAYMENT SCHEDULES.   (a) At least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent an updated
version of SECTIONS 2.2(a), 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.  
-19-    (b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
and thereafter within two (2) Business Days prior to the Earnout Payment
Date, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent and the Exchange
Agent a schedule (each, a "PAYMENT SCHEDULE") setting forth (i) the name and
address of each Stockholder/former Stockholder entitled to distribution of
Merger Consideration at such time and (ii) the amount of consideration to
which each such Stockholder/former Stockholder is then entitled, together
with any supporting schedules and documentation (showing the number and type
of shares held immediately prior to such time by each such holder). The
Exchange Agent shall determine in accordance with each Stockholder\'s
election pursuant to SECTION 1.15 hereof, and pursuant to any adjustment
required by SECTION 1.15 hereof, the form of consideration to be received by
each Stockholder. Parent and the Exchange Agent may rely on the Payment
Schedule for distributions and shall have no responsibility or liability with
respect thereto.   1.9 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT.
Parent, U.S. Bank National Association, or another institution selected by
Parent prior to the Effective Time and reasonably acceptable to the
Stockholder Representative, shall serve as the exchange agent (Parent in such
capacity, or such institution, the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the Merger.   (b)
PARENT TO PROVIDE CONSIDERATION. Subject to the provisions of SECTION 7.3
relating to escrow arrangements, at the Effective Time, on the Earnout
Payment Date, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange
in accordance with this ARTICLE I the consideration payable at each such time
pursuant to SECTION 1.6; provided, however, that, at the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund (as defined in SECTION
7.3(a) hereof) the shares of Parent Common Stock that comprise the Escrow
Amount out of the aggregate number of unrestricted shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise deliverable to the Stockholders pursuant to SECTION 1.6
hereof. The Pro Rata Portion of the Parent Common Stock comprising the Escrow
Amount shall be deemed to be contributed to the Escrow Fund with respect to
each Stockholder.   (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. On or as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within no later than three (3) Business Days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall mail a letter of transmittal (in
customary form and containing such provisions and instructions as Parent may
reasonably specify and the Company may reasonably approve prior to the
Effective Time) to each Stockholder at the address set forth opposite each
such Stockholder\'s name on the relevant Payment Schedule. Upon surrender of
a certificate or the certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the "COMPANY
STOCK CERTIFICATES") for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, subject to the terms of SECTION 1.9(e) hereof,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive
from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor, Parent Common Stock and/or cash
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to SECTION 1.6 (less the Pro
Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to be deposited into the Escrow Fund with
respect to such Stockholder), and each Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Company Stock
Certificate outstanding   -20-   after the Effective Time will be deemed,
for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to SECTION 1.6
hereof (without interest) into which such shares of Company Capital Stock
shall have been so converted. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with
respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until
the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such
Company Stock Certificate pursuant hereto; provided, however, that holders
who are deemed to receive shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to SECTION
1.6(d) or SECTION 1.6(e) shall be deemed to have validly surrendered such
shares in accordance with this SECTION 1.9(c).   (d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH
RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company
Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate. Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate,
there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest
shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company
Capital Stock.   (e) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, or
if any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to SECTION 1.6 hereof to
person other than the person or entity whose name is reflected on the Company
Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of
the issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) EXCHANGE AGENT TO RETURN
PARENT COMMON STOCK. At any time following the last day of the respective six
(6) month period following each of the Effective Time and the Earnout Payment
Date, as applicable, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent
to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash that have been deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to SECTION 1.9(b) hereof, and any income or proceeds thereof, not
disbursed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to SECTION
1.9(c) hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates shall
be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms of SECTION 1.9(g)
hereof) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all amounts
that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock  
-21-   Certificates pursuant to SECTION 1.6 hereof upon the due surrender
of such Company Stock Certificates in the manner set forth in SECTION 1.9(c)
hereof.   (g) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this SECTION 1.9, neither the Exchange Agent, the Final Surviving Entity, nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   1.10 NO FURTHER
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. The cash amounts paid and Parent
Common Stock issued in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Final Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Final
Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this ARTICLE I.   1.11 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED
CERTIFICATES. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required
pursuant to SECTION 1.6 hereof; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates
to either (i) deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as it
may reasonably direct or (ii) provide an indemnification agreement in
reasonable and customary form and substance, against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   1.12 REORGANIZATION
STATUS. The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company
intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute
integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the
parties adopt by executing this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the First Step Merger and the Second
Step Merger to be treated as one integrated transaction that qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and none of
the parties hereto will take any action that would be reasonably expected to
cause the First Step Merger and Second Step Merger not so to qualify.  
1.13 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Final Surviving Entity with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and the Subs, and the officers and
directors of the Company and the Subs are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.   -22-    1.14 ADJUSTMENTS. If, during the
period between the date hereof and the Effective Time:   (a) any change in
the outstanding capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
reverse stock split, exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend
thereon with a record date prior to the Effective Time or amendment of any
material term of any outstanding security issued by Parent, then in each
case, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted;   (b) except as
addressed in SECTION 1.14(a), Parent declares, sets aside or pays any
dividends on, or makes any other distributions (whether in cash, stock,
equity securities or property) in respect of any capital stock of Parent,
then the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted.   1.15 CASH/STOCK
ELECTION.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
each Stockholder will be entitled to elect to receive, in lieu of the shares
of Parent Common Stock and cash otherwise deliverable to such Stockholder
in respect of the Closing Consideration as determined in accordance with
SECTION 1.6, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash
determined pursuant to this SECTION 1.15. Each letter of transmittal to be
executed by Stockholders in accordance with this Agreement shall contain a
provision whereby each Stockholder shall indicate the percentage of the
aggregate value of the Closing Consideration deliverable to such Stockholder
that such Stockholder desires to receive in cash (the "DESIRED CLOSING CASH
PERCENTAGE"), and the percentage of the aggregate value of the Closing
Consideration deliverable to such Stockholder that such Stockholder desires
to receive in Parent Common Stock (the "DESIRED CLOSING STOCK PERCENTAGE"),
and in lieu of receiving the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash otherwise
deliverable to such Stockholder in respect of the Closing Consideration
determined in accordance with SECTION 1.6, such Stockholder shall instead be
entitled to receive cash reflecting the Desired Closing Cash Percentage (the
"DESIRED CLOSING CASH CONSIDERATION") and Parent Common Stock reflecting the
Desired Closing Stock Percentage (the "DESIRED CLOSING STOCK CONSIDERATION")
(subject to adjustment as set forth in SECTION 1.15(b) below).   (b)
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, in no event shall Parent be obligated to
deliver to Stockholders (or the Escrow Agent pursuant to SECTION 7.3 hereof)
in respect of the Closing Consideration an aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock with a value (at the Signing Price) in excess of the
Stock Closing Consideration or an aggregate amount of cash in excess of
the Cash Closing Consideration. In the event that the implementation of
the elections of Stockholders contemplated by this SECTION 1.15 would result
in either shares of Parent Common Stock being issued (in the aggregate) with
a value (at the Signing Price) greater than the Stock Closing Consideration
or an aggregate amount of cash in excess of the Cash Closing
Consideration, respectively, then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
so issuable and cash so deliverable shall be adjusted as follows:  
-23-    (i) if the elections provided in subparagraph (a) would require
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued with an aggregate value (at the
Signing Price) greater than the Stock Closing Consideration, then:   (1)
each Stockholder\'s Desired Closing Stock Consideration shall be reduced such
that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each
Stockholder shall equal (A) (x) such Stockholder\'s Desired Closing Stock
Consideration, divided by (y) the aggregate Desired Closing Stock
Consideration of all Stockholders, multiplied by (B) the Stock Closing
Consideration, divided by the Signing Price, and   (2) each Stockholder\'s
Desired Closing Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to
the number of shares so reduced for such Stockholder in accordance with
subparagraph (1) above, multiplied by the Signing Price.   (ii) if the
elections provided in subparagraph (a) would require more cash to be
delivered (in the aggregate) than the Cash Closing Consideration, then:  
(1) each Stockholder\'s Desired Closing Cash Consideration shall be reduced
such that the amount of cash to be issued to each Stockholder shall equal (A)
(x) such Stockholder\'s Desired Closing Cash Consideration, divided by (y)
Desired Closing Cash Consideration of all Stockholders, multiplied by (B) the
Cash Closing Consideration, and   (2) each Stockholder\'s Desired Closing
Stock Consideration shall be increased by a number of shares Parent Common
Stock equal to the amount of cash so reduced for such Stockholder in
accordance with subparagraph (1) above, divided by the Signing Price.

ACTIVITIES. Except as set forth in SECTION 2.12 or SECTION 2.15(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no agreement (non-competition or otherwise),
commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree to which the Company is a
party or otherwise binding upon the Company which has or may reasonably be
expected to have the effect of prohibiting or impairing any business practice
of the Company, any acquisition of property (tangible   -33-   or
intangible) by the Company, the conduct of business by the Company, or
otherwise limiting the freedom of the Company to engage in any line
of business or to compete with any person. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, except as set forth in SECTION 2.12 or SECTION 2.15(f) of
the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not entered into any agreement under
which the Company is restricted from selling, licensing, manufacturing or
otherwise distributing any of its technology or products or from providing
services to customers or potential customers or any class of customers, in
any geographic area, during any period of time, or in any segment of the
market.   2.13 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ABSENCE OF LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES;
CONDITION OF EQUIPMENT; CUSTOMER INFORMATION.   (a) The Company does not
own any real property, nor has the Company ever owned any real property.
SECTION 2.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of (i) all real
property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company or
otherwise used or occupied by the Company for the operation of its business
(the "LEASED REAL PROPERTY"), and (ii) each lease, license, sublease or other
occupancy right and each amendment thereto (the "LEASE AGREEMENTS") with
respect to each Leased Real Property. All such Lease Agreements are valid and
effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under
any of such leases, any existing default, rentals past due, or other event of
default which would reasonably be likely to result in the ability of the
other party to such Lease Agreement to terminate, modify in any material
respect or require additional payment thereunder (or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default). The Company has not
received any written notice of a default, alleged failure to perform, or
any offset or counterclaim with respect to any such Lease Agreement, which
has not been fully remedied and withdrawn. To the Knowledge of the Company
the Closing will not affect the enforceability against any person of any such
Lease Agreement or the rights of the Company to the continued use and
possession of the Leased Real Property for the conduct of business as
presently conducted.   (b) The Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, free from structural, physical and mechanical defects
and is structurally sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the
business as presently conducted. Neither the operation of the Company on the
Leased Real Property nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, such Leased Real
Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect
any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such
property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent
on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.   (c) The Company has good and
valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets, real,
personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear of
any Liens, except (i) as reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, (ii) Liens
for Taxes that are being contested in good faith (for which adequate accruals
or reserves have been established on the Current Balance Sheet) and Liens for
Taxes not yet due and payable, and (iii) such imperfections of title and
encumbrances, if any, which do not detract from the value or interfere with
the present use of the property subject thereto or affected thereby.

ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement, including the payment
of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the filing of any
documents, applications or certificates for the purposes of maintaining,
perfecting or preserving or renewing any Company Registered Intellectual
Property. In each case in which the Company has acquired ownership of any
Intellectual Property from any person, the Company has obtained a valid and
enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights in such
Intellectual Property to the Company, and, with respect to any
such Intellectual Property that is Registered Intellectual Property, in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has recorded (or
will timely record) each such assignment with the relevant governmental
authorities, including the PTO, the U.S. Copyright Office, or their
respective equivalents in any relevant foreign jurisdiction, as the case may

joint ownership of any Intellectual Property that is or had been Company

rights in any Company Intellectual Property.   (h) The Company Intellectual
Property, together with the Intellectual Property licensed to the Company
pursuant to the in-licenses listed in SECTION 2.14(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule, and the Shrink-Wrap Code licensed to the Company, constitutes all
of the Intellectual Property used in, necessary to or that otherwise would be
infringed by the conduct of the business of the Company as it is: (a)
currently conducted by the Company (including with respect to the Company
products, Technology or services currently under active development); or (b)
to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise proposed to be conducted by the
Company; including in each case without limitation, the design, development,

currently conducted by the Company (including with respect to the Company
products, Technology and services currently under active development) and, to
the Knowledge of Company, as they are otherwise proposed to be conducted, has
not and does not infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual Property rights
of any third party under the laws of any jurisdiction. Except as set forth in
SECTION 2.14(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Final Surviving Entity will
own or possess all Technology and sufficient rights under all Intellectual
Property immediately following the Closing Date that are necessary to the
business and operations of the Company, without infringement or

(l) SECTION 2.14(l) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all contracts, licenses
and agreements between the Company and any other person wherein or whereby
the Company has agreed to, or assumed, any obligation or duty to warrant,

with respect to the infringement or misappropriation by the Company, or such
other person of the Intellectual Property of any person other than the
Company; provided such disclosure shall not be required with respect
to indemnities (i) offered in connection with non-exclusive licenses with
respect to Company Products granted to end-users in the course of business
that do not materially differ in substance from the indemnities in Company\'s
standard form(s) or (ii) that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
result in liability to the Company in excess of the amounts paid by such
person to the Company.   (m) There are no contracts, licenses or agreements
granting any rights between the Company and any third party with respect to

raised or caused by Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, raised or
caused by a third party, regarding the scope or validity of such grant or
performance of either party thereunder.   (n) The Company has not received
notice from any person claiming that the business and operations of the
Company or any product, Technology or service (including products, Technology

misappropriates any Intellectual Property of any person.   (o) Neither this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the assignment to Parent by operation of law or
otherwise of any contracts or agreements to which the Company is a party,
will result in (i) Parent or the Final Surviving Entity granting to any third
party any right to or with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by, or
licensed to, Parent or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) Parent or the
Final Surviving Entity being bound by or subject to, any exclusivity

third party under any contract, license or agreement with respect to any
Intellectual Property in excess of those payable by any of them,
respectively, in the absence of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the representations made in this
SECTION 2.14(o) will not be deemed breached as a result of the operation of
provisions contained in any contract, license, agreement or arrangement to
which Parent is a party (but to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is not); and provided further that the representations made in this SECTION
2.14(o) will not be deemed breached by virtue of rights granted by, or
obligations or restrictions with respect to the Final Surviving Entity,
except in excess of those to which the Company would have been bound in the
absence of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   (p) To
the Knowledge of the Company, no person or entity has infringed or
misappropriated or is infringing or misappropriating any Company Intellectual
Property; provided that the foregoing representation shall apply
to Company\'s actual knowledge and not be construed to imply a duty of
investigation (even if competitors have products that Company later, through
further diligence and/or investigation, determines are or have been
infringing or misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property).  
-38-    (q) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has
taken reasonable steps in accordance with normal industry practice to protect

Company or provided by any other person to the Company. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company has, and enforces, a policy requiring each employee,
consultant, and contractor to execute proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment agreements consistent with normal industry
practice and with Company\'s standard forms provided to Parent during the due
diligence process.   (r) No Company Intellectual Property is subject to any
outstanding decree, order, judgment or settlement agreement or stipulation
("ORDER") that restricts in any material manner the use, transfer or
licensing thereof by the Company, or the validity, use or enforceability of
such Company Intellectual Property; provided that the foregoing
representation shall be limited to the Knowledge of Company as relates to any
generally-applicable Order to which Company or its subsidiaries is not a
party.   (s) No government funding, facilities or resources of a
university, college, other educational institution or research center or
funding from third parties was used in the development of the Company
Intellectual Property and no Governmental Entity, university, college, other
educational institution or research center has any claim or right in or to
the Company Intellectual Property. No current or former employee, consultant
or independent contractor of the Company who was involved in, or who
contributed to, the creation or development of any Company Intellectual
Property, has performed services for the government, a university, college or
other educational institution, or a research center, during a period of time
during which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was also
performing services for the Company.   (t) With the exception of software
developers under contract to the Company in the ordinary course to develop
code for Company and bound by confidentiality obligations, the Company has
not disclosed, delivered or licensed to any escrow agent or other third party
any source code the copyright for which is owned by the Company or which was
developed by the Company ("COMPANY SOURCE CODE"), nor has the Company agreed
to or authorized such disclosure, delivery or licensing. Subject to the same
exceptions, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) will, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery by or on
behalf of the Company to any third party of any Company Source Code.   (u)
SECTION 2.14(u) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all software or other
material that is distributed as "freeware," "free software," "open
source software" or under a similar licensing or distribution model
(including but not limited to the GNU General Public License) that is
incorporated into, combined with, or distributed in conjunction with any
Company products ("INCORPORATED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE") and identifies the
type of license or distribution model governing its use. The Company\'s use
and/or distribution of each component of Incorporated Open Source Software
complies with all material provisions of the applicable license agreement,
and such use and/or distribution by the Company does not give rise under such
license agreement to any obligation in favor of any third party for the
Company to disclose or distribute, in source code form,   -39-   any
software or source code the copyright for which is owned by the Company
or which was developed by the Company, to license for the purpose of
making derivative works any software or source code the copyright for which
is owned by the Company or which was developed by the Company, or to
distribute without charge any such software or source code the copyright for
which is owned by the Company or which was developed by the Company.   2.15
AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS. Except as set forth in SECTION 2.15 of
the Disclosure Schedule (specifying the appropriate subparagraph),
the Company is not a party to, nor is it bound by any of the following (each,

Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

that becomes payable on the Earnout Payment Date exceeds $2,500,000 minus the
amount of Third Party Expenses (other than Earnout Contingent Expenses)
reflected on the Closing Date Third Party Expense Statement. The amount of
any Third Party Expenses of the Company (other than the Earnout Contingent

therefor, without the consent of the other party, except that this
restriction shall be subject to Parent\'s obligation to comply with
applicable securities laws and the rules of Nasdaq or any other securities

Contract (including with respect to the Lease Agreements) as are
required thereunder in connection with the Merger or for any such Contracts
to remain in full force and effect, all of which are listed in SECTION 2.5 of
the Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits to,
the Company under such Contract from and after the Effective Time. Such
consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent. In the event that the other parties to any such Contract, including
lessor or licensor of any Leased Real Property, conditions its grant of a
consent, waiver or approval (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration, including increased rent

Parent and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other party of: (i)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-

6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a) not to be satisfied, and (ii) any failure of the
Company or Parent to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this SECTION 5.8 shall
not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a
breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to
this SECTION 5.8 shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedule, or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or
breach of covenant; provided, however, that at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent an updated
version of the Disclosure Schedule with any changes thereto made solely for
the purposes (x) of updating lists of contracts, agreements or licenses
entered into after the date hereof and in accordance with Section 4.1 hereof
and (y) to comply with the updating requirements of Section 1.8.   5.9
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time,

NEW EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. Parent or the Final Surviving Entity will offer
all or substantially all Employees "at will" employment by Parent and/or the
Final Surviving Entity, to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon proof of
a legal right to work in the United States (each, an "OFFER LETTER"). Such
"at will" employment will: (i) be subject to and in compliance with Parent\'s
applicable policies and procedures, including, but not limited to, employment
background checks and the execution of an employee proprietary information
agreement, governing employment conduct and performance and (ii) have terms,
including the position and salary, which will be determined by Parent after
consultation with the Company\'s management. Each employee of the Company who
remains an employee of Parent or the Final Surviving Entity after the Closing
Date shall be referred to hereafter as a "CONTINUING EMPLOYEE." Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to receive benefits consistent with Parent\'s
applicable human resources policies and shall receive compensation
and benefits substantially comparable to those of similarly situated
employees of Parent. Each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under Parent\'s employee
benefit plans (other than any Parent equity-based awards) for years of
service with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective
Time. Subject to any third party insurer\'s consent, including no loss and no
gain policies, Parent will cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which such Continuing
Employee and their eligible dependents will participate to be waived, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to
Closing Date and will, upon receipt of proof from the employee, provide
credit for any coinsurance and deductibles prior to the Effective Time but in
the plan year which includes the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible, out-of-   -62-   pocket or similar
requirements under any such plans that may apply for such plan year after the
Effective Time.   5.11 TERMINATION OF 401(k) PLAN. Effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA
Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) PLAN") (unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall
not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the
Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s)
have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the
Company or such Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent.
The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event
that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date.   5.12 SECTION
280G. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
submit to the stockholders of the Company for approval (in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent), by such number of stockholders of
the Company as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code,
any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
("SECTION 280G PAYMENTS") (which determination shall be made by the Company
and shall be subject to review and approval by Parent), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and
prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence
satisfactory to Parent that (A) a vote of the stockholders of the Company was
solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect
to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote
(the "280G STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"), or (B) that the 280G Stockholder Approval
was not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits
shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to
constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the waivers of those payments
and/or benefits, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the
stockholder vote.   5.13 FINANCIALS. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare, and to cause its auditors to take such actions
as are necessary for the preparation of, the Company\'s audited balance sheet

necessary for Parent to file the 2006 Audited Financials with the SEC.

conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock.   (c) As soon as may be reasonably practicable, the
Company and Parent each shall file with the United States Federal Trade

comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification
or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as reasonably
agreed by the parties to be required. The Company and Parent each shall
promptly supply the other with any information which may be required in order
to effectuate such filings; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the
Company shall be required to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business,
assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any
of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such
assets, properties and stock.   5.15 EMPLOYEE RETENTION AGREEMENTS. The

Employee Securityholder agrees to forfeit permanently two-thirds (2/3) of the
value of the cash or shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to SECTION 1.6(D)(III) or 1.6(D)(IV) in the

commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the Stockholders identified
on SCHEDULE 5.16 to enter into a letter agreement (the "PARENT STOCK SALE
AGREEMENT") pursuant to which such Stockholder will agree that, for a period
of 90 days beginning on the first day after the Closing Date, it will not

indemnification; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require any
Indemnified Party to make, seek or otherwise pursue a claim for any available
insurance benefits. If any Indemnified Party receives any insurance or other
recoveries, subsequent to any indemnification under this SECTION 7.2, then

therefor.   (c) No Stockholder shall be liable under this SECTION 7.2 for
(i) any Loss hereunder until the aggregate amount of all Losses under all
claims of all Indemnified Parties shall exceed an amount equal to two million
dollars ($2,000,000) (the "BASKET"), at which time all Losses incurred
(including the amount of the Basket) shall be subject to indemnification
hereunder, (ii) any punitive, special or indirect damages, including business
interruption, loss of future revenue or profits, or loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, (iii) any Loss to the extent a specific accrual or reserve for the
amount of such Loss was reflected on the Company\'s financial statements, or
(iv) in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the amount of any Loss indemnified
hereunder and arising in connection with any treatment of any Employees in
the manner specifically required by this Agreement, including in connection
with the negotiation, execution, or consummation of the Employee Proprietary
Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreements or the Employee
Retention Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket shall not
apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to
(A) Losses resulting from Excess Third Party Expenses, (B) Losses resulting
from any breach of representation or warranty contained in SECTION 2.2
(Company Capital Structure) or in SECTION 2.11 (Tax Matters) hereof and (C)
Losses resulting from the obligation of the Stockholders to pay its portion
of the Transfer Taxes specified in SECTION 5.20 hereof.   -71-    7.3
ESCROW ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) ESCROW FUND. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock represented by a single stock certificate registered in the name
of Var and Co., as nominee of the Escrow Agent, which together equal the Escrow
Amount out of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise
deliverable to the Stockholders pursuant to SECTION 1.6 hereof and shall
confirm such deposit with the Escrow Agent. Such deposit of the Escrow Amount
(plus any New Shares (as defined in SECTION 7.3(c)(IV) hereof) shall
constitute an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND") to be governed by the terms set
forth herein. Such shares of Parent Common stock shall be deposited by Parent
as, for this purpose, agent of the Stockholders, who shall thereupon, without
any act by them, be treated as having received from Parent under SECTION 1.6
such Parent Common Stock in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions and then as having deposited such shares of Parent Common Stock into
the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be security for the indemnity
obligations provided for in SECTION 7.2 hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be
available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties for any claims by such
parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are
entitled to recovery under this ARTICLE VII. The Escrow Agent may execute
this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such
later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the
binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the
other signatories hereto. Interests in the Escrow Fund shall be non-
transferable.   (b) ESCROW PERIOD; DISTRIBUTION UPON TERMINATION OF ESCROW
PERIODS. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Survival Date (the "ESCROW PERIOD");
provided, however, that the Escrow Period shall be extended to the extent
that any shares of Parent Common Stock shall remain in the Escrow Fund after
such time. Promptly on the next Business Day after the Survival Date, a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the Escrow Fund less (y)
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock with a value (based on
the Signing Price) equal to the aggregate amount of all claims specified in
any Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder
Representative prior to the Survival Date, shall be released by the Escrow
Agent to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Thereafter, as soon as any each
such claim referred to in clause (y) above shall have been resolved, the
aggregate amount of shares of Parent Common Stock with a value (based on the
Signing Price) equal to the amount claimed less any amount distributed to
Parent in accordance with SECTION 7.4, shall promptly be released by the
Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In accordance with SECTION
7.4, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund
not required to satisfy any remaining unresolved claims to the
Stockholders. Deliveries of amounts out of the Escrow Fund to the
Stockholders pursuant to this SECTION 7.3(B) shall be made in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining shares in the Escrow
Fund, with the number of shares delivered to each Stockholder rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Any distribution
of all or a portion of the Parent Common Stock to the Stockholders shall be
made by delivery of the stock certificate held by the Escrow Agent
representing the Parent Common Stock to the Parent, endorsed for  
-72-   transfer, with instruction to the Parent to transfer and issue, or
cause its transfer agent to transfer and issue, the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock being distributed, allocated among the
Stockholders based upon their respective Pro Rata Portion, in each case by
issuing to each such Stockholder a stock certificate representing such
allocated shares, registered in their respective names set forth on the
schedule delivered to the Escrow Agent at Closing and mailed by first class
mail to such Stockholders\' address set forth on such schedule (or to such
other address as such Stockholder may have previously instructed the Escrow
Agent in writing); and, if less than all the then remaining shares of Parent
Common Stock are to be so distributed and transferred, the Escrow Agent shall
instruct the Parent to issue and return to the Escrow Agent (or its nominee,
if the Escrow Agent shall so instruct) a stock certificate representing the
remaining shares of Parent Common Stock. The Escrow Agent shall have no
liability for the actions or omissions of, or any delay on the part of, the
Parent in connection with the foregoing.   (c) PROTECTION OF ESCROW
FUND.   (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow
Fund during the Escrow Period and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund
only in accordance with the terms of this SECTION 7.3(c).   (ii) Each of
the Stockholders shall have voting rights with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock contributed to and held in the Escrow Fund on behalf of
such Stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in
respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock). The Escrow Agent shall from
time to time deliver such proxies, consents and other materials and documents
as may be necessary to enable the Stockholders to exercise such voting
rights, and shall instruct the Stockholders to return any instructions with
respect to such voting rights to the Escrow Agent, who shall tabulate
all votes received by the Stockholders and shall vote on their behalf in
accordance with the instructions given by each such Stockholder. In the
absence of instructions by any such Stockholder, the Escrow Agent shall not
vote any of the shares held on behalf of such Stockholder.   (iii) The
Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders agree that the Stockholders
shall be solely responsible for providing, at their cost and expense, any
certification, opinion of counsel or other instrument or document necessary
to comply with or satisfy any transfer restrictions to which the Parent
Common Stock is subject, including without limitation any opinion of counsel
required to be delivered pursuant to any restrictive legend appearing on the
certificate evidencing the Parent Common Stock in connection with
any distribution of Parent Common Stock to be made by the Escrow Agent under
or pursuant to this Agreement. Any such opinion of counsel shall include the
Escrow Agent as an addressee or shall expressly consent to the Escrow
Agent\'s reliance thereon.   (iv) Cash dividends, and any non-cash taxable
dividends or distributions (other than New Shares as defined below), on any
shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the
Stockholders according to their Pro Rata Portion, and shall not become a part
of the Escrow Fund. Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity
securities issued or distributed by Parent after the Effective Time
(including shares issued upon a nontaxable   -73-   stock split) ("NEW
SHARES") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not
been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund and
become a part thereof. The parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) agree
that the Stockholders are the owners of any stock in the Escrow Fund.
New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have
been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but
shall be distributed to the record holders thereof.   7.4 INDEMNIFICATION
CLAIMS.   (a) CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION. In order to seek
indemnification under SECTION 7.2, Parent shall deliver an Officer\'s
Certificate to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent at any
time on or before the Survival Date. On the thirtieth (30th) day after the
Escrow Agent\'s and the Stockholder\'s receipt of the officer\'s Certificate,
unless the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered an Objection
Notice pursuant to SECTION 7.4(b) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
deliver to the Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the
Loss set forth in such Officer\'s Certificate. Any payment from the Escrow
Fund to Indemnified Parties shall be made in Parent Common Stock (valuing
each share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Signing Price) and shall be
deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the Stockholders based on the
aggregate amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund on each such Stockholder\'s
behalf. For the purposes hereof, "OFFICER\'S CERTIFICATE" shall mean a
certificate signed by any Vice President or above of Parent: (1) stating that
an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue
Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the basis and
factual background to such indemnification claim, the individual items of
Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant contained herein to which such item is related.   (b) OBJECTIONS
TO CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION. No such payment shall be made under SECTION
7.4(a) if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement
to the claim made in the Officer\'s Certificate (an "OBJECTION NOTICE"), and
such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to Parent and the Escrow
Agent prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after
the Stockholder Representative\'s and the Escrow Agent\'s receipt of the
Officer\'s Certificate. If the Stockholder Representative does not to object
in writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Officer\'s Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses
shall thereafter be made in accordance with this Section 7.4.   (c)
RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS; ARBITRATION.   (i) In case the Stockholder
Representative delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with SECTION
7.4(b), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement   -74-   shall be prepared and
signed by both parties and furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.   (ii) If, after
thirty (30) days after delivery of an Objection Notice, no such agreement can
be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent, on the one hand, or
the Stockholder Representative on the other hand, may demand arbitration of
the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation
with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until
such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in
either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one
arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative.
In the event that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to
arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree
on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each
select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. If the Stockholder Representative fails to select an
arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that
the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by Parent.  
(iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, under the
rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. All expenses
relating to the arbitration, including without limitation, the fees of each
arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association
shall be allocated between Parent and the Stockholders (on the basis of their
respective Pro Rata Portions) such that the amount paid by the Stockholders
bears the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount unsuccessfully
disputed by the Stockholder Representative in the arbitration bears to the
total dollar amount of the disputed items that were submitted for arbitration
pursuant to this SECTION 7.4(c), and Parent shall pay the balance; provided,
however, that each party shall bear its own respective expenses relating to
the arbitration, including without limitation, legal and expert witness fees
and investigatory expenses. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may
be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to
reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties
an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority
of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the
dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have
the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys\' fees and costs, to
the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators
or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that
discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was
refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the
arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to
the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer\'s Certificate shall be
final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions, which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order
awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms
of such award, judgment, decree or order as   -75-   applicable. Within
ten (10) days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one
party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party.  
(iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply
to any dispute under this ARTICLE VII.   (d) THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. In the
event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM")
which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, Parent shall promptly notify the Escrow Agent
and the Stockholder Representative of such claim. The Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Stockholders, shall be entitled, at its
expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of
such Third Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; provided, however,
that in the event Parent does not notify the Stockholder Representative that
it is assuming the defense of such claim within thirty (30) days
after receipt of notice of the claim from the Indemnified Party, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to determine or conduct, the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Parent; provided, further that except with the consent of the Stockholder
Representative, no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of any right to indemnification under
SECTION 7.2 or the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object to the amount agreed
by the Stockholder Representative to be payable pursuant to SECTION 7.2 in
respect of such Third Party Claim. The party controlling the defense of any
Third Party Claim shall keep the other relevant party hereto (the "NON-
CONTROLLING PARTY") advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and shall
consider in good faith all recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party
with respect thereto.   (e) ESCROW AGENT\'S DUTIES.   (i) The Escrow Agent
shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are
specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this
Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, or,
in the reasonable opinion of Escrow Agent, will not result in additional
obligations or liabilities to the Escrow Agent, and may rely and shall be
protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably
believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper
party or parties. The Escrow Agent\'s duties hereunder are ministerial in
nature and shall not be deemed fiduciary. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence
of such good faith.   (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized
to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by
any other person, excepting only notices delivered pursuant to this Agreement
or orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly  
-76-   authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of
any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any
of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been
entered without jurisdiction.   (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable
in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties
executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or
any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.   (iv) The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any
statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents
deposited with the Escrow Agent.   (v) In performing any duties under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages,
losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability
for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any
action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any
written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow
Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be
liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining
the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may
consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agent\'s
duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken,
suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice
of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying
the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any
party to this Agreement.   (vi) If any controversy arises between the
parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject
matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not
be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it.
The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or
other means as, in the Escrow Agent\'s discretion, may be required, despite
what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow
Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at
its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer
and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the
Escrow Fund held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader
action (the "AGENT INTERPLEADER EXPENSES") and which the parties agree to pay
as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%)
to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders\' respective
Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that in the event any Stockholder fails
to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses,
the parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such Stockholder\'s Pro
Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses and recover an equal amount
(which shall be deemed a Loss) from such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of
the Escrow   -77-   Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent
shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and
liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.   (vii) The parties and
their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to
indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of
investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel
and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow
Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this
Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this
Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out
of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the
"AGENT INDEMNIFICATION EXPENSES") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid
by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis
of the Stockholders\' Pro Rata Portions directly from the Escrow Fund;
provided, however, that in the event the Stockholders\' portion of the
Agent Indemnification Expenses cannot be satisfied from the Escrow Fund in
full, the parties agree that Parent shall pay the shortfall of such
Stockholders\' portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, and shall be
entitled to recover such amount from each Stockholder equal to such
Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of such amount without regard to any caps or
other limits herein. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold
harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement.   (viii) The
Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days
written notice to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative; provided,
however, that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their best
efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days
after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor
escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to
appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State
of New York or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a
successor escrow agent and shall remain the escrow agent until such order is
received. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument
accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with
all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor
escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a
successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further
duties and liability under this Agreement.   (ix) The Escrow Agent is
hereby authorized in carrying out any sale of the Escrow Fund permitted by
this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any
one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such affiliate is acting as a
subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal
for its own account.   (x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
provision seeking to limit the liability of the Escrow Agent shall not be
applicable in the event such liability arises from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.   (xi) Notwithstanding any term
appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in no instance shall the Escrow
Agent be required or obligated to distribute any of the Escrow Fund  
-78-   (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be taken
by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has
received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form,
or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under
the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be.   (f) FEES. All fees
(including attorney\'s fees) of the Escrow Agent for performance of its
duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee
schedule of the Escrow Agent previously delivered to Parent. It is understood
that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent
shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not
promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided
for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of Parent, or
if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of the
Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a
party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or
its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for
such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney\'s fees,
including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by
such default, delay, controversy or litigation.   (g) SUCCESSOR ESCROW
AGENTS. Any corporation or other entity into which the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual
capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or other entity to which
substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under
this Escrow Agreement without further act.   7.5 STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE.   (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the requisite vote of the Stockholders, each of the Stockholders
shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Mikael Berner as its agent and
attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the
Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against
any Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against any Indemnified Party or
any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder, in each
case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or (ii) contemplated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency
may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the
Stockholder Representative may not be   -79-   removed unless holders of
a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the
identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled, or a substitution of a new Stockholder
Representative may be effected, by the holders of a majority in interest of
the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative,
and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Stockholders.   (b) The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith without gross
negligence. The Stockholders shall severally (each based on its Pro Rata
Portion) but not jointly indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold
the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of
the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representative\'s
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative ("STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE EXPENSES"). A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative, including but not limited to an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders. The
Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person
for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.   7.6 MAXIMUM PAYMENTS; REMEDY.   (a) Parent hereby agrees
that (i) all indemnification claims pursuant to SECTION 7.2 may only be made
by resort to the Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, it being understood and agreed that the Escrow Fund shall be the
sole and exclusive source of recovery and remedy of Parent with respect to
any such claim, and (ii) the maximum amount an Indemnified Party may recover
from each Stockholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in
SECTION 7.2 hereof for Losses shall be limited to such Stockholder\'s Pro
Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.   (b) Except as set forth in SECTION 7.6(c)
and SECTION 7.6(d), effective as of the Effective Time, Parent and each of
the Subs waive any rights and claims it may have against the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholders or any of their respective affiliates,
whether in law, in equity or otherwise, relating to the Company and all of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that after the
Effective Time, SECTION 7.2 will provide the exclusive remedy for any of the
items listed in clauses (i)-(iv) of SECTION 7.2(a) and for any and all other
claims arising out of this Agreement or nay of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any
party in respect of Losses arising out of any fraud or any willful breaches
of representations and warranties or covenants on the part of such party.  
-80-    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, in the event the Merger does not close, the Company\'s
liability for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or
covenant shall be limited to such breaches or inaccuracies resulting from the
Company\'s fraud, willful breach or gross negligence.   (e) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any release of shares
from the Escrow Fund shall be limited to that number of shares then available
in the Escrow Fund.   ARTICLE VIII   EARNOUT   8.1 EARNOUT
ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) Earnout Generally. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the Company\'s projected revenue targets (as described below) are
material factors in determining the valuation of the Company by Parent.  
(b) Distribution of Earnout.   (i) In the event Parent delivers an Earnout
Notice (as defined in Section 8.3 hereof) stating that a portion of the
Earnout Consideration has been earned pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, subject
to SECTION 8.1(b)(ii) hereof Parent shall distribute the portion of the
Earnout Consideration set forth in the Earnout Notice (the "EARNED EARNOUT
AMOUNT") as follows:   (1) first, if the Earnout Bonus Milestone has
been achieved, then five percent (5%) of the Earned Earnout Amount, if any
(the "EARNOUT BONUS POOL PAYMENT"), shall be paid to the Earnout Bonus
Pool Participants in the proportions specified in SCHEDULE 8.1(b)(i)(1) as
soon as practicable but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Earnout Payment Date (as defined in SECTION 1.6(a) hereof).   (2) second,
the portion of the Earned Earnout Amount, if any, remaining after payment of
the Earnout Bonus Pool Payment, if any pursuant to SECTION 8.1(b)(i)(1) (the
"FINAL EARNOUT AMOUNT") shall be paid to the former Stockholders in
accordance with SECTION 1.6(b) as soon as practicable but in any event within
five (5) Business Days of the Earnout Payment Date.   (ii) With respect to
disputes of amounts contained in the Earnout Notice, upon the final
determination of such amounts in dispute determined to be due and payable to
the Stockholders in accordance with SECTION 8.3(c) hereof, Parent shall
distribute such amounts, if any, as so finally determined to be payable to
the Stockholders not theretofore delivered as soon as practicable but in any
event within three (3) Business Days of the Earnout Payment Date.  
-81-    (c) Forfeited Amounts. Any portion of the Earnout Consideration
that is not earned by the Stockholders pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII will
be forfeited and retained permanently by Parent.   8.2 EARNOUT
DETERMINATION. The Earned Earnout Amount shall be calculated as follows: (A)
the Milestone Percentage (as defined below) minus 67.86 percent divided by
(B) 32.14 percent and multiplied by (C) the Earnout Consideration; provided
that in no event shall the Earned Earnout Payment exceed the
Earnout Consideration; provided further, that if the Milestone Percentage is
equal to 67.86 percent or less, the Earned Earnout Amount shall be zero
($0.00). For the purposes of this SECTION 8.2, "MILESTONE PERCENTAGE" equals
(A) Revenues earned in calendar year 2007 divided by (B) the 2007 Revenue
Milestone. By way of example and for the avoidance of doubt, if Revenues
equal $50,400,000, the Milestone Percentage would equal ninety percent (90%)
and the Earned Earnout Amount would equal $41,331,673.93.   8.3 EARNOUT
DISTRIBUTION; STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE OBJECTIONS.   (a) EARNOUT
DISTRIBUTION. On or prior to the Earnout Determination Date, Parent shall
deliver to the Stockholder Representative a memorandum (the "EARNOUT NOTICE")
specifying in reasonable detail the calculation of the portion of the Earnout
Consideration earned, if any, and the calculation of the distribution of the
Earned Earnout Amount to each of the Earnout Bonus Pool Participants and the
former Stockholders pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII and SECTION 1.6, if any,
with the basis for such calculation, in accordance with GAAP. Parent agrees
that it will promptly supply any reasonably requested back up or supporting
information to the Stockholder Representative or its accountants on which the
earnout calculations are based; provided, however, that the provision of any
such back up or supporting information shall be conditioned upon the
execution of a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent.   (b) STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE OBJECTION. The
Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days to make an objection
(in writing) to any item in the Earnout Notice, and such written objection
must be delivered to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period.   (c) RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS.   (i) In case the Stockholder
Representative shall have objected in writing to the Earnout Notice in a
timely manner or in case of any other dispute relating to the Earnout
Consideration, the Stockholder Representative and Parent will attempt in good
faith to resolve such objection or dispute. If the Stockholder Representative
and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be
prepared and signed by both parties.   (ii) In the event the parties cannot
come to an agreement as set forth in SECTION 8.3(c)(i) within thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as the parties may mutually determine) after the
date on which the Stockholder Representative objected in writing to the
Earnout Notice, or in the event the dispute does not relate to an Earnout
Notice, the date on which the parties determine that they are unable to reach
agreement pursuant to SECTION 8.3(c)(i), such dispute shall be resolved in
the manner set forth in SECTION 7.4(c).   -82-    (iii) If the
Stockholder Representative executes a memorandum with Parent pursuant to
SECTION 8.3(c)(i) or a resolution is made pursuant to SECTION 8.3(c)(ii),
then such resolution shall be final and any portion of the Earnout
Consideration, as finally determined, not previously deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall be deposited in accordance with SECTION 1.6.   (d)
EARNOUT RIGHTS NOT TRANSFERABLE. Except with the written consent of Parent
(which consent may be withheld in Parent\'s sole discretion), no Stockholder
may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to
receive any portion of the Earnout Consideration, other than (i) by the laws
of descent and distribution or succession, or (ii) as a result of
any donative transfer to any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,
stepparent, grandparent, spouse or sibling, including adoptive relationships
of any Stockholder, or a trust, corporation, partnership or other entity for
the exclusive benefit of such persons, and any transfer in violation of this
SECTION 8.3(d) shall be null and void and shall not be recognized by Parent
or the Final Surviving Entity.   (e) PARENT SUCCESSOR OBLIGATIONS FOR
EARNOUT PAYMENTS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the event Parent shall consummate any transaction pursuant to
which all or substantially all of the business, properties or assets of
Parent are transferred to another person not directly or indirectly
controlled by Parent, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or
otherwise, the Final Earnout Amount shall be paid in cash, shares of common
stock of such successor person (which shares shall be freely transferable and
listed on a U.S. national securities exchange), or some combination of the
two.   (f) EARNOUT PROTECTIONS.   (i) During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007, Parent shall conduct the
Company Business in an operating unit of Parent (the "COMPANY BUSINESS
UNIT"). The Company Business Unit will, during such period, use separate
business unit level accounting systems and have the ability to produce a
business unit level profit and loss statement.   (ii) It is Parent\'s
current intention following the Closing to operate the Company Business
consistent with past practice with a view to achieving the Company\'s 2007
revenue plan; provided, however, that the parties acknowledge and agree that
Parent shall have the ability to react in Parent\'s sole discretion to
changes in business conditions as they occur, including, without limitation,
by taking actions (i) to achieve synergies the availability of which cannot
be known as of the date hereof and (ii) in reaction to the prolonged failure
of the Company Business Unit to execute against its business objectives.  
(1) Parent shall in good faith, subject to Parent\'s reasonable business
judgment, support and assist in the sale of the Company\'s Beyond, VoComm or
Telephony solutions to its current and prospective customers provided such
sales are consistent with past practices; and   -83-    (2) Parent shall
in good faith, subject to Parent\'s reasonable business judgment, support and
assist the Company in conducting good faith negotiations (i) to enter into
new customer agreements which would allow the Company Business Unit to secure
new business or (ii) to secure extensions or renewals of customer agreements
in existence on the date hereof, provided that any such new, extended or
renewed agreement is on terms substantially consistent with past practices;
and   (3) Parent agrees that SCHEDULE 8.3 represents the operating plan for
the Company Business Unit. Parent also agrees that if the prior quarter\'s
revenue is no less than 95% of the operating plan, then the subsequent
quarter\'s expense target will be set at no less than 97.5% of the operating
plan. Parent and the Company agree that notwithstanding the above,
the expense targets can be changed to reflect the benefit of any
identified efficiencies or synergies   (iii) In the event during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007, Parent sells
directly conflicting solutions to Company client deployments in existence as
of the Effective Time, the revenue from such sales will be credited to
Revenues for purposes of determining achievement of the 2007 Revenue
Milestone.   (iv) In the event during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007, Parent sells the Company
Business Unit or any material part of the Company Business, Parent will
calculate the impact of such sale on achievement of the 2007 Revenue
Milestone and credit Revenues accordingly.   ARTICLE IX   TERMINATION,
AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by unanimous
written agreement of the Company and Parent;   (b) by Parent or the Company
if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by May 31, 2007; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 9.1(B)
shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the First Step Merger to
occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes
breach of this Agreement;   (c) by Parent or the Company if: (i) there shall
be a final non-appealable order of a federal or state court in effect
preventing consummation of the First Step Merger, or (ii) there shall be any
statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed
applicable to the Closing by any Governmental Entity that would make
consummation of the Closing illegal;   (d) by Parent if there shall be any
action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated
or issued or deemed applicable to the First Step Merger by any  
-84-   Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parent\'s ownership
or operation of any portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel
Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of
the business or assets of the Company or Parent as a result of the First Step
Merger;   (e) by Parent, if neither it nor any Sub is in material breach
of its representations, covenants or agreements such that a failure of a
condition to Closing contained in this Agreement would be triggered under
this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement such that
the conditions set forth in SECTION 6.2(a) hereof would not be satisfied and
such breach has not been cured within twenty (20) calendar days after written
notice thereof to the Company and the Stockholder Representative; provided,
however, that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its
nature cannot be cured; or   (f) by the Company if the Company is not in
material breach of its representations, covenants or agreements such that a
failure of a condition to Closing contained in this Agreement would be
triggered under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in SECTION 6.3(a) hereof would
not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured within twenty (20)
calendar days after written notice thereof to Parent; provided, however, that
no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be
cured.   The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
SECTION 9.1 (other than pursuant to Section 9.1(a)) shall give notice of
such termination to the other party.   9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the
event of termination of this Agreement as provided in SECTION 9.1 hereof,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, the Company or the Stockholders, or their
respective officers, directors or stockholders, if applicable; provided,
however, that each party hereto shall remain liable for any willful breaches
of this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided further, however,
that, the provisions of SECTIONS 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 hereof, ARTICLE X hereof
and this SECTION 9.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this ARTICLE IX.  
9.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
party against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this SECTION 9.3,
the Stockholders agree that any amendment of this Agreement signed by
the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective against
the Stockholders whether or not they have signed such amendment.   9.4
EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one hand,
and the Company and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, may,

in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with
any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part   -85-   of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes of this
SECTION 9.4, the Stockholders agree that any extension or waiver signed by
the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective
against all Stockholders whether or not they have signed such extension or
waiver.   ARTICLE X   GENERAL PROVISIONS   10.1 NOTICES. All notices and

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   10.3 COUNTERPARTS. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or

Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure
Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among

PERFORMANCE. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy

right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms

equity.   10.7 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
