shall:

 

(1) prepare and deliver to MCC (i) an estimated balance sheet of the Company

accordance with the standards for the preparation of the Company Closing

of the Chilean JV Closing Balance Sheet set forth in Section 2.14(a);

(2) prepare and deliver to MCC a certificate signed by the chief financial
officer or other executive officer of the Company and the Chilean JV (the "

based on the definition of Closing Date Net Indebtedness contained herein,
the Companys, and with respect to the Chilean JV, the Companys and DLJs
best estimate of (A) the Closing Date Net Indebtedness for the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (excluding the Chilean JV and its Subsidiaries) (the "
_Estimated Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness_ ") and (B) the Chilean JV
Closing Date Net Indebtedness for the Chilean JV and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Estimated Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness_ ") and (z) taking into
consideration the Estimated Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness and the
Estimated Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness, a calculation of the
Company Closing Stock Consideration (without giving effect to the proviso in
the definition thereof regarding Excess Shares) and the DLJ Closing
Consideration.

 

(b) On the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, MCC shall prepare in good
faith and deliver to the Company a certificate signed by the chief financial
officer or other executive officer of MCC setting forth (y) the number of MCC
Shares issued and outstanding as of the close of business two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, and (z) based on such amount and the amounts set
forth in the Closing Date Consideration Calculation Certificate, a calculation
of the number of MCC Shares to be included in the Company Closing Stock
Consideration, the number of Excess Shares, if any, and the amount of the
Company Closing Cash Consideration, if any.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger
contemplated hereby shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be
held at 10:00 a.m., local time on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all 

 



20  conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in Article VII (other
than those conditions which are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), but not before
October 3, 2011, at the offices of Keating Muething and Klekamp PLL, or at such
other time or on such other date or at such other place as the Company and MCC
may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place

2.3 _Actions at the Closing of the Merger_. At the Closing of the Merger:

(a) the Surviving Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware the Certificate of Merger;

(b) MCC shall deliver (i) certificates (or, at the option of MCC, evidence of
shares in book-entry form) for the Merger Shares (as defined in Section 2.6(b)
below) to each Company Stockholder entitled to receive such Merger Shares
pursuant to Section 2.6, but excluding such Company Stockholders Pro Rata
Share of the Company Indemnity Escrow Shares, Special Environmental Escrow
Shares and Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit; and (ii) a payment in cash
(either in the form of an MCC company check or by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the applicable Company
Stockholder) to each Company Stockholder entitled to receive a portion of the
Company Closing Cash Consideration, if any, in the amount set forth in Section
2.6; and

 

(c) MCC shall deposit on behalf of the Company Stockholders the Company
Indemnity Escrow Shares, Special Environmental Escrow Shares and Adjustment
Company Escrow Deposit with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Company Indemnity Escrow Shares, Special Environmental
Escrow Shares and Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit (to the extent consisting
of MCC Shares) shall, at the option of MCC, be issued in either certificated
or book-entry form in the name of the Escrow Agent.

2.4 _Additional Action_. The Surviving Company may, at any time after the
Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of the Company, in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.5 _Restricted Securities_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the MCC
Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement will not be registered under
the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and are being offered
and sold in reliance upon federal and state exemptions for transactions not
involving any public offering. Each certificate representing shares of MCC
Shares covered by this Agreement (if such shares are certificated) shall be
stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following
form: 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED 

 



21  UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES OR
BLUE SKY LAWS. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE
OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER SAID ACT OR LAWS.

In the event that any of the MCC Shares to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement (i) become registered under the Securities Act or (ii) are eligible
to be transferred without restriction in accordance with Rule 144 or another
exemption from registration under the Securities Act, MCC shall issue new
certificates or other instruments representing such MCC Shares, which shall
not contain the legend in this Section 2.5 and shall instruct its transfer
agent to make any necessary notations in the share register book of MCC to
reflect the removal of such legend; provided such Company Stockholder
surrenders to MCC the previously issued certificates or other instruments, if
any, together, in the case of clause (ii) of this paragraph, with a customary
representation letter or opinion of counsel regarding such
Persons eligibility to sell under Rule 144 or such other exemption.

2.6 _Effect of Merger on Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the holder of
any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of the Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Company Dissenting Shares (as defined
below)) shall be converted into and represent the right to receive (y) a
number of MCC Shares equal to (i) the Company Closing Stock Consideration
_divided by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Stock
held in the Companys treasury), plus (z) the Company Closing Cash
Consideration, if any, divided by the total number of shares of Company Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Company Stock held in the Companys treasury);

(b) The Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive (i) certificates
(or, at the option of MCC, evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing
the MCC Shares into which their shares of Company Stock were converted
pursuant to Section 2.6(a) (the " _Merger Shares_ ") and (ii) a payment in
cash (either in the form of an MCC company check or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the applicable Company
Stockholder) in the amount of the Company Closing Cash Consideration, if any,
into which their shares of Company Stock were converted (together with the
Merger Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender to MCC or its
designated representative of any Company Stock Certificate, together with
a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto. MCC hereby designates the
Stockholders Representative as its designated representative for purposes of
receiving the Letters of Transmittal. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an 

 



22  affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the
posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Company may determine and direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such, the Surviving Company will deliver, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates, the
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement. Each Company Stockholder shall have the right to elect to become a
party to the Investor Rights Agreement by making an affirmative election to
that effect in the Letter of Transmittal. Any Company Stockholder who elects
to become a party to the Investor Rights Agreement shall have all the rights
and be subject to all the agreements and covenants of "Investors" thereunder.

(c) Each share of Company Stock held in the Companys treasury immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without payment of
any consideration therefor.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.6(a) and Section
2.6(b), each Company Stockholder will be deemed to have received and hereby
authorizes MCC to deposit with the Escrow Agent such portion of the Company
Closing Consideration equal to such Company Stockholders Pro-Rata Share of
the Company Indemnity Escrow Shares, the Special Environmental Escrow Shares
and the Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit. Such Company Indemnity Escrow
Shares, Special Environmental Escrow Shares and Adjustment Company Escrow
Deposit shall be deducted from the portion of the Company Closing
Consideration such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b) without any act of any such
Company Stockholder.

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Dissenting Shares_ " means
shares of Company Stock held as of the Effective Time by a Company
Stockholder who has not voted such shares of Company Stock in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
with respect to which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected
in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and not
effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior to the Effective Time. Company
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such Company Stockholder shall have
forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law or properly withdrawn, his, her or its demand for
appraisal.

 

(b) If such Company Stockholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its
right to appraisal of Company Dissenting Shares, then (i) as of the
occurrence of such event, such holders Company Dissenting Shares shall cease
to be Company Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of
Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.6, and

 



23  (ii) promptly following the occurrence of such event, MCC shall deliver to
such Company Stockholder a certificate or certificates (or, at the option of
MCC, evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing the Merger Shares
and a payment in cash (either in the form of an MCC company check or by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
applicable Company Stockholder) in the amount of the Company Closing Cash
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.6.

(c) The Company shall give MCC (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to confer with the Company regarding all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of MCC, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of shares of Company Stock or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

2.8 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Merger Shares shall be issued to former Company Stockholders upon the
surrender for exchange of certificates, that immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Company Stock converted into Merger
Shares pursuant to Section 2.6 (" _Company Stock Certificates_ "), and such
former Company Stockholders shall not be entitled to any voting rights,
rights to receive any dividends or distributions or other rights as a
stockholder of MCC with respect to any fractional Merger Shares that would
have otherwise been issued to such former Company Stockholders. In lieu of any
fractional Merger Shares that would have otherwise been issued, each former
Company Stockholder that would have been entitled to receive a fractional
Merger Share shall, upon proper surrender of such persons Company Stock
Certificates, receive such whole number of Merger Shares as is equal to the
precise number of Merger Shares to which such person would be entitled,
rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (with a fractional interest
equal to .5 rounded to the nearest odd number);  _provided_ that each such
holder shall receive at least one Merger Share.

2.9 _Company Options and Warrants_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all action necessary to cause the termination, as of the Effective Time,
of any outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Stock (the " _Company
Options_ "), including without limitation, those options granted under the
Companys Amended and Restated 2008 Management Equity Incentive Plan (such
plan, the " _Company MEIP_ ") that remain unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Company Options granted under the Company MEIP shall be
terminated through at least one of the following methods in accordance with
the terms of such Company Options: (i) the Companys Board of Directors shall
determine that the "Fair Market Value" (as defined in the Company MEIP) of a
share of Company Stock does not exceed the exercise price of any of the
Company Options, or (ii) the Companys Board of Directors shall provide the
holders of the Company Options with a reasonable amount of time (as
determined by the Companys Board of Directors in its sole discretion) to
exercise any vested and unexercised

 



24  Company Options and resolve that any remaining outstanding Company Options
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

2.10 _Certificate of Formation, Limited Liability Company Agreement, Etc._

 

(a) The Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Company immediately
following the Effective Time shall be the same as the Certificate of
Formation of Newco prior to the Effective Time.

(b) The Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Surviving Company
immediately following the Effective Time shall be the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Newco prior to the Effective Time.

(c) The principal office of the Surviving Company in the State of Delaware as
of the Effective Time shall be 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, County of New
Castle and the name of its registered agent at such address is The
Corporation Trust Company.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Newco serving
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be the officers of the
Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be. 

2.11 _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, no shares of
Company Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Company Stock
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as
provided herein or by Law.

2.12 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company
Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock
Certificates are presented to MCC they shall be cancelled and exchanged in
accordance with Section 2.6, subject to applicable Law in the case of Company
Dissenting Shares.

 

2.13 _Withholding Rights_. Each of MCC, Newco and the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable
to any Person (whether in cash or MCC Shares) pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of applicable Tax law (with any MCC Shares
withheld valued at the closing price per share as reported on The NASDAQ Stock
Market on the trading day preceding the payment). To the extent that such
amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Authority by MCC, Newco or the Surviving Company, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and
withholding was made. 

 



25 2.14 _Company Closing Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) On or before the date that is thirty (30) calendar days following the
Closing Date, MCC shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders
Representative and DLJ (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a
balance sheet of the Chilean JV as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Chilean JV Closing Balance Sheet_ " and together with the Company
Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Closing Balance Sheets_ "), and (ii) a
calculation of Closing Date Net Indebtedness for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (excluding the Chilean JV and its Subsidiaries) (the " _Company
Closing Date Net Indebtedness_ ") and for the Chilean JV and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness_ "), in each case, based on
the Closing Balance Sheets and the definition of Closing Date Net
Indebtedness. The Company Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared from the
Books and Records and in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Last Company Audited Balance Sheet, and shall fairly
present the financial position of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, without giving effect to any changes to the balance
sheet resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
financing thereof). The Chilean JV Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared
from the Books and Records and in accordance with Chilean GAAP in a manner
consistent with the preparation of the most recent audited financial
statements of the Chilean JVs Subsidiaries Cameo Chile, S.A. and Cameo
Etiprak, S.A., and shall fairly present the financial position of the Chilean
JV as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, without giving effect to
any changes to the balance sheet resulting from the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the financing thereof). With respect to the calculation of
any amount, payment, or claim denominated in any currency other than
United States Dollars, the amount of such amount, payment or claims shall be
determined by dividing the amount denominated in such currency by the
applicable rate published by _The Wall Street Journal_ (Midwest edition) in
the "Currencies" section of the Money and Investing on the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any amount denominated in
Chilean Pesos, the exchange rate published by the Chilean Central Bank on the
date of determination shall apply.

(b) Upon delivery of the Closing Balance Sheets, MCC will provide the
Stockholders Representative, DLJ and their respective Representatives with
reasonable access to the Books and Records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably necessary for the Stockholders
Representatives evaluation of the Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness and
the Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness. The Stockholders Representative
may dispute the calculation of Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness and the
Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness, in each case by notifying MCC of
such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheets;
_provided_ that the basis of any such dispute shall be limited to mathematical
errors, the failure of any of the

 



26  Closing Balance Sheets to be prepared in accordance with the standards set
forth in Section 2.14(a), or the failure of Company Closing Date Net
Indebtedness or the Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness to have been
calculated in accordance with the respective definitions thereof contained
herein. In the event that the Stockholders Representative does not provide
such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) calendar day period,
the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the
calculation of Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness and the Chilean JV
Closing Date Net Indebtedness delivered by MCC, which shall then be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, MCC and the Stockholders
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
thirty (30) calendar days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree)
to resolve any disagreements with respect to the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheets and/or the calculation of Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness
or the Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness. If MCC and the Stockholders
Representative are unable to resolve such disagreements then, at any time
thereafter, either the Stockholders Representative or MCC may require that
Deloitte and Touche LLP (or such other accounting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by MCC and the Stockholders
Representative) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining disagreements.
The Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within thirty (30) calendar days of the date on which such dispute is referred
to the Auditor, whether and to what extent (if any) the calculation of Company
Closing Date Net Indebtedness or Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness
requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-
half by MCC and one-half by the Stockholders Representative. The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. The date on which the Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness and the
Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness are finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.14(b) is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Determination Date_." The Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.14(b) shall be referred to as the
" _Final Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness_ " and the Chilean JV Closing
Date Net Indebtedness as finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.14(b) shall be referred to as the " _Final Chilean JV Closing Date Net
Indebtedness_."

 

(c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(A) the Estimated Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness _plus_ fifty percent
(50%) of the Estimated Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness _minus_ (B)
the Final Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness _plus_ fifty percent (50%) of
the Final Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness.

(1) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount, the "
_Increase Amount_ ") then, within five (5) Business Days after the
Determination Date, (x) the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to release to
the Company Stockholders (excluding holders of Company Dissenting
Shares) their Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit, (y)
MCC shall issue to the

 



27  Company Stockholders (excluding holders of Company Dissenting Shares), to
the extent not resulting in the issuance of Excess Shares, their Pro Rata
Share of a number of MCC Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
the Increase Amount by the Issue Price, and (z) to the extent the payment of
the Increase Amount in full would result in the issuance of any Excess Shares,
their Pro Rata Share of cash in an amount equal to the number of Excess
Shares which would otherwise be issued pursuant to clause (y) above (without
giving effect to the limitation thereof regarding Excess Shares) multiplied by
the MCC Stock Price as of the Effective Time.

 

(2) If the Adjustment Amount equals zero (0) then, within five (5) Business
Days after the Determination Date, the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent
to release to the Company Stockholders (excluding holders of Company
Dissenting Shares) their Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Company Escrow
Deposit.

 

(3) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ ") then, within five (5) Business Days after
the Determination Date, the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to release to
MCC (w) first, cash out of the Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit equal to the
Deficit Amount, (x) second, to the extent the Deficit Amount exceeds the cash
portion of the Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit (such deficit, the " _Initial
Excess Deficit Amount_ "), such number of MCC Shares constituting the non-cash
portion of the Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the Initial Excess Deficit Amount by the Issue Price, (y)
third, to the extent the MCC Shares constituting the non-cash portion of the
Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit are insufficient to satisfy the Initial
Excess Deficit Amount (such deficit, the " _Remaining Excess Deficit Amount_
"), the number of Company Indemnity Escrow Shares equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the Remaining Excess Deficit Amount by the Issue Price.
If any Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit remains after satisfaction in full of
the Deficit Amount, the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to release to the
Company Stockholders (excluding holders of Company Dissenting Shares) the
Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit equal to their Pro Rata Share of the amount
of such excess.

(d) Upon determination of the Adjustment Amount in accordance with this
Section 2.14, the Stockholders Representative and MCC shall each execute
joint instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Adjustment Company Escrow Deposit, and if required, Company
Indemnity Escrow Shares, in accordance with this Section 2.14 and the Escrow
Agreement. The Company Closing Consideration shall be deemed to be increased
by all MCC Shares issued and cash paid, if any, by MCC to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 2.14, and the Company Closing
Consideration shall be deemed to be decreased by all MCC 

 



28  Shares released to MCC pursuant to this Section 2.14. Any additional MCC
Shares issued by MCC pursuant to this Section 2.14 or Adjustment Company
Escrow Deposit distributed hereunder shall be allocated to such Company
Stockholders who are not holders of Company Dissenting Shares based on their
respective Pro Rata Share. To the extent any fractional MCC Shares would be
required to be distributed by the Escrow Agent to any Company Stockholders or
to MCC under this Section 2.14, the procedures set forth in the Escrow
Agreement shall apply. To the extent any fractional MCC Shares would be
required to be issued by MCC to the Company Stockholders under this Section
2.14, the procedures set forth in Section 2.8 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ ,
such that the number of shares will be adjusted up or down, as applicable.

2.15 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, there is a change in the number of outstanding MCC
Shares by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-
up, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or
rights issued in respect of, MCC Shares (other than the Merger contemplated
hereunder or as set forth on _Section 5.3(a)_ of the MCC Disclosure Letter),
the Company Closing Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
to the Company Stockholders and DLJ the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event.

business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each 

 



31  jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect. True and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation,

Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (in each case, as
amended to the date of this Agreement) have been delivered or Previously

of the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder have been duly and
validly authorized by the respective board of directors (or similar
governing body) of DLJ and the Company with no other action on the part of
DLJ or the Company, as applicable, being necessary therefor other than, in the
case of the Company, the Company Stockholder Consent. This Agreement and each

Ancillary Agreements to be executed at the Closing, will be) duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of the Company and DLJ, as applicable, and

fraudulent conveyance or similar laws in effect which affect the enforcement

the certificate of merger in connection with the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and (ii) where the failure to obtain any such consent,
waiver, approval, authorization, License, order or permit or to take any such

whole or to the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any material contract
or material license or permits to which MCC or any MCC Subsidiary is a party

Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-3(b).

5.12 _Debt Financing_.

(a) _Section 5.12_ of the MCC Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate copy of the executed amendment to the MCC Credit Agreement, with all
related schedules, exhibits and annexes attached thereto (collectively, the "
_MCC Credit Agreement Amendment_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to MCC (or to the Company or a
Company Subsidiary) for the purpose of financing the amounts payable by MCC
and its Subsidiaries under _Article II_ and _Article III_ hereof, the
extension of the maturity date of existing Indebtedness of MCC under the MCC
Credit Agreement and the repayment or refinancing of certain outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $500,000,000, which aggregate principal
amount consists of $187,500,000 originally made available under the MCC Credit
Agreement plus an additional amount of not less than $312,500,000
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing_ "). Except as set forth in the MCC
Credit Agreement Amendment, there are no conditions precedent to the
respective obligations of the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing. Other than
the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment, there are no other agreements, side
letters or arrangements that would permit the Lenders to reduce the amount of
the Debt Financing or that would otherwise affect the availability of the Debt
Financing. Each of the MCC Credit Agreement and the MCC Credit Agreement
Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by, and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of MCC and its Affiliates that are parties thereto, and to
the Knowledge of MCC, all other parties thereto, except as the enforceability
thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar laws in effect which affect the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or equitable principles
or remedies (whether considered at law or equity). The MCC Credit Agreement
is in full force and effect and upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Sections 2(b)(2), 2(b)(3) and 2(b)(4) of the MCC Credit Agreement
Amendment, the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment will be in full force and
effect, and neither the MCC Credit Agreement nor the MCC Credit Agreement
Amendment has been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in
any respect, except as permitted by Section 6.10. All commitment and other
fees required to be paid under the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit
Agreement Amendment on or prior to the date hereof have been paid and, as of
the date hereof, to the Knowledge of MCC, there is no fact or occurrence
existing that would make any of the statements (including any representations
or warranties) set forth in the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit
Agreement Amendment inaccurate. Neither MCC nor any of its Affiliates nor, to
the Knowledge of

 



53  MCC, any other party to the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement
Amendment, is in material breach or violation of, or material default under,
the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment.

(b) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 7.1 and 7.3 and
no material breach or default by the Company or DLJ hereunder, to the
Knowledge of MCC, there is no fact or occurrence as of the date hereof that
would cause the conditions to funding of the Debt Financing as set forth in
the MCC Credit Agreement and the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment not to be
satisfied at or before the Closing, and MCC has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing
to be satisfied by it contained in the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit
Agreement Amendment. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section
7.1 and 7.3, on or before the Closing Date MCC will have, (i) sufficient cash,
available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to
consummate all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the payment of the amounts payable by MCC and its
Subsidiaries under _Article II_ and _Article III_ hereof and the repayment or
refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and the payment of any fees or expenses associated with any of
the foregoing, and (ii) the resources and capabilities (financial
and otherwise) to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

5.13 _Offering of Securities_. Neither MCC nor any Person acting on its
behalf has taken any action (including any offering of any securities of MCC
under circumstances which would require integration of such offering with the
offering of any MCC Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement under
the Securities Act and rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder) which
might subject the offering and issuance of any of the MCC Shares to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement to registration requirements
of the Securities Act. 

5.14 _No Other Representations and Warranties; Schedules_. None of MCC or
Newco or any of their respective Affiliates or their and their Affiliates
Representatives, makes or has made any express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of MCC or Newco other than those expressly set forth in
this _Article V_. The inclusion of any matter in the MCC Disclosure Letters
shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by MCC or Newco or otherwise
imply that any such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement.

during normal business hours, to the offices, Facilities and Books and Records
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Business, (ii) furnish to the

auditor in connection with such auditors review of any financial statements

customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent auditor, and (iii) make available to MCC, the employees, officers
and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as MCC may from time

transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that MCC shall not
unreasonably interfere with the Business or operations of the Company and
shall not conduct any invasive environmental, health or safety investigation
or sampling, including any subsurface investigation prior to the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party granting access may withhold
any document (or portions thereof) or information (A) that is subject to the
terms of a non-disclosure agreement with a third party, (B) that may
constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work product,
or (C) if provision of such document (or portions thereof) or information, as
determined by such partys counsel, would reasonably be expected to conflict
with applicable Laws.

 

(b) The Company agrees, and each of the Company and DLJ agrees to cause the

assisting in the preparation of offering circulars, confidential information

agreement or document related to the Debt Financing. All reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Company, DLJ or any Company Subsidiaries in
connection with the foregoing shall be paid or reimbursed promptly following
demand therefor, by MCC. If the Effective Time does not occur, the Company,
DLJ, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall be
indemnified and held harmless by MCC for and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing
(or Alternate Debt Financing) and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than information provided by or on behalf of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries).

6.3  _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding any provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect after the date hereof until the Closing, at which time it
shall terminate, and all information provided to MCC pursuant to Section 6.2
shall be held by MCC as Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) and shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
that MCC shall be entitled to share Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) with the Lenders and their respective counsel,
Affiliates and advisors (which each shall be considered "Representatives"
thereunder and "MCC Representatives" hereunder) pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement applicable to the Representatives. Without limiting
the foregoing, MCC shall not, and shall cause the MCC Representatives not to,
contact or communicate with any of the customers or suppliers of the Business
with respect to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If
this Agreement is for any reason terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, DLJ shall treat all non-
public or proprietary data and information relating to the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the Business (" _Confidential Information_ ") as
confidential, preserve the confidentiality thereof and not duplicate or use or
disclose to any Person such Confidential Information, other than to its
Affiliates and limited partners and their respective Representatives in
connection with the analysis of the transactions contemplated hereby and/or
DLJs reporting obligations to its limited partners. DLJ shall inform each
such Affiliate, limited partner or Representative of the provisions of this
Section 6.3 and shall be responsible for ensuring that any such Persons shall
abide by such provisions. The obligation of confidentiality imposed by this
Section 6.3 shall not apply to Confidential Information that otherwise is or
becomes publicly available through no act of DLJ in breach of this Agreement.
If 

 



59  any Person makes a demand on DLJ purporting to legally compel it to divulge
any such Confidential Information during such period, DLJ shall, to the extent
legally permitted, immediately give notice of the demand to MCC. Prior to the
time DLJ may be compelled to divulge any Confidential Information during such
period, MCC may, at its own expense, challenge the demand, initiate judicial
proceedings to obtain an appropriate protective order or injunction or seek
other appropriate legal remedies. So long as DLJ is not legally required to
divulge such Confidential Information, DLJ shall not divulge such Confidential
Information during such period until MCC either has concluded not to
challenge the demand, or has exhausted its challenge, including appeals, if
any; and thereafter may divulge, without liability hereunder, only such
Confidential Information which is legally required.

 

6.4 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations, Consents_. The Company, DLJ (with
respect to the transfer of the Chilean JV Interests) and MCC shall cooperate
with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.
Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
authorizations, consents (including any consents required under the terms of
any Material Contract), orders and approvals of, and to give all notices to
and make all filings with, all Governmental Authorities and other third
parties that may be or become necessary for or as a result of its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement, and each party will cooperate fully with the other parties in
promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party agrees to take any and all commercially reasonable
action (at its sole cost and expense) to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including (A) the prompt use of its
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the defense through litigation on
the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by
any Person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions, in
each case, if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of any order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority and (B) the
prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any
kind that would make consummation of

 



60  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms
unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all
steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such
actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as
close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything set forth in this Agreement, no partys obligations
hereunder shall be deemed to require such party to divest any assets or
properties held by such party or to hold any assets or properties separately
as a condition of obtaining the consent of any Antitrust Authority to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.5 _Further Action_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
before, at and after the Closing, each of the parties hereto covenants and
agrees (x) to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered such documents and other papers and to take or cause to be taken
such further actions as may be necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby, and, in furtherance of the foregoing and subject to
applicable Law, the Company (and DLJ, with respect to the Chilean JV) agree
to cooperate with MCC, and take any action reasonably requested by MCC, with
respect to the integration of the Business and the Company with MCCs existing
businesses and operations and (y) to refrain from taking any actions
(other than exercising its rights or complying with its obligations
hereunder) that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or impede the
Closing.

6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) From the date hereof through Closing, the parties hereto shall give
prompt notice to the other parties of (i) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any
notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any Actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed;

warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect and (v) any material failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any of its respective covenants, conditions or agreements to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, or to satisfy any condition.

 

(b) The Company shall provide MCC with an unaudited balance sheet and the
related statements of income, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity
of the Company, prepared consistently (including as to scope and detail) with
the financial

indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person or group
of Persons (other than MCC or any of its Affiliates) in furtherance of any
merger, sale of material assets (other than as permitted under Section 6.1),
sale of the Company or the Chilean JV Interests, or similar transactions
involving the Company or the Business (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ").
Without limiting the obligations under the preceding sentence, DLJ (with
respect to the Chilean JV Interests) and the Company shall (i) immediately
notify MCC (orally and in writing) if any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated, any inquiry or proposal is made, any information is
requested with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) include in such
notification the terms of any such proposal or offer that it may receive with
respect thereto (and provide MCC with a copy thereof in writing), including
the identity of the soliciting party and (iii) keep MCC informed with respect
to the status of the foregoing.

 

6.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) MCC and Newco agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified D andO Parties_") as provided in their
respective Governing Documents or in any agreement (a " _Company
Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in effect on the date of this Agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. MCC and the Surviving Company shall (and MCC
shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to Indemnified DandO Parties with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent provided by: (i) the Governing
Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and (ii) any Company Indemnity Agreement between any such
Indemnified DandO Party on the one hand and the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries on the other hand.

 



62 (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.8(a), from and after the
Effective Time, MCC will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified DandO Party from
and against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (including, in each case, any interest or
assessments thereon) in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnified DandO Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; or
(B) the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby; and
(ii) pay (within 30 days following any request for advancement) the expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnified DandO Party incurred
in connection with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified DandO Party
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified DandO Party is not entitled to be indemnified, in each case, if such
Indemnified DandO Party is entitled to indemnification or advancement of
expenses as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys Governing Documents or any applicable Company Indemnity
Agreement.

 

(c) MCC will provide, or cause the Surviving Company to provide, for a period
of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified DandO
Parties who are insured under the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy with an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company; _provided_ that MCC
and the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount,
MCC or the Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
may and at MCCs request shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a
"tail" directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy,
_provided_ that payment for each year of insurance coverage provided by
such "tail" directors and officers insurance policy shall not exceed 300%
of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company. Any such
"tail" directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy will
satisfy MCCs obligation under this Section 6.8(c) to provide DandO Insurance.

(d) The Indemnified DandO Parties to whom this Section 6.8 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8. The provisions of this Section
6.8 are

 



63  intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified DandO Party and his or her
successors, heirs and representatives.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.8 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of MCC, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified DandO
Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
MCC, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such other person or the successors and assigns of MCC or the Surviving
Company as the case may be shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.

6.9 _Intercompany Accounts and Related Party Transactions._ DLJ and the
Company shall cause all intercompany accounts between DLJ, the Diamond Castle
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the other hand, as of the Closing to be settled (irrespective
of the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts) in the manner provided
in this Section. Except as set forth in Section 6.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, DLJ and the Company shall cause all agreements between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and DLJ or the Diamond
Castle Entities, on the other hand, to be terminated as of the Closing and,
except as set forth in Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter, each
party thereto shall have granted to the other parties thereto a full and
unconditional release from any and all obligations arising thereunder, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to MCC. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company (and DLJ, with respect to the Chilean JV)
shall prepare and deliver to MCC a statement setting out in reasonable detail
the calculation of all such intercompany account balances based upon the
latest available financial information as of such date and, to the extent
requested by MCC, provide MCC with supporting documentation to verify the
underlying intercompany charges and transactions. All such
intercompany account balances shall be settled in full on or prior to the
Closing.

6.10 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) MCC shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the MCC Credit
Agreement and the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment, including taking all actions
necessary to (A) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the MCC Credit Agreement and the MCC Credit Agreement
Amendment and (B) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing;
_provided_ that none of MCC, Newco or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required under this Section 6.10(a) to threaten, commence
or

 



64  prosecute any legal proceeding against any lender or other party to the MCC
Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment.

 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit
Agreement Amendment or the Debt Financing available under the MCC Credit
Agreement Amendment or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment shall expire, be
terminated or modified in a manner adverse to MCC for any reason, MCC shall
arrange to obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to replace the
Debt Financing (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, when
obtained, to provide DLJ and the Company with a copy of, a new
financing commitment (the " _New Debt Financing Commitment_ "). To the extent
applicable, MCC shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Alternate Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New Debt Financing
Commitment, including taking all actions necessary to (A) satisfy on a timely
basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the New Debt Financing
Commitment; (B) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the New Debt Financing Commitment
(including the flex provisions) and (C) consummate the Alternate Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing.

 

(c) MCC shall keep DLJ and the Company fully informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the status of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the MCC Credit Agreement and the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment (or any
Alternate Debt Financing contemplated by any New Debt Financing Commitment)
and shall give DLJ and the Company prompt notice of any material change with
respect to such Debt Financing (or Alternate Debt Financing). Without limiting
the foregoing, MCC agrees to notify DLJ and the Company promptly, and in any
event within two Business Days, if at any time (i) the Debt
Financing available under the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit
Agreement Amendment (or any New Debt Financing Commitment) shall expire or be
terminated for any reason or any party thereto shall be in material breach
thereof, (ii) any financing source that is a party to the MCC Credit
Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment (or any New Debt Financing
Commitment) notifies MCC that such source no longer intends to provide
financing to MCC on the terms set forth therein, (iii) any material dispute
or disagreement arises among any of the parties to the MCC Credit Agreement or
the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment (or any New Debt Financing Commitment) or
(iv) for any reason MCC no longer believes in good faith that it will be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the MCC
Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment (or any Alternate Debt
Financing contemplated by any New Debt Financing Commitment) on the
terms described therein. MCC shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take or fail
to take any action or enter into any transaction, including any merger,
acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity
financing, that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent
consummation of the Debt Financing contemplated by the MCC Credit Agreement or
the 

 



65  MCC Credit Agreement Amendment (or any Alternate Debt Financing contemplated
by any New Debt Financing Commitment). MCC shall not amend, alter or waive any
of its rights under, or agree to amend, alter or waive any of its rights
under, the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment (or any
New Debt Financing Commitment) in any manner that would (A) reduce the amount
of Debt Financing (or Alternate Debt Financing) to an amount less than the
amount necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) impose new or additional conditions to such Debt Financing (or
Alternate Debt Financing) or (C) prevent, impair or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby without, in each case, the prior written
consent of the Company. MCC shall promptly deliver to the Company and DLJ
copies of any such amendment, alteration or waiver. Any material breach of
the MCC Credit Agreement, MCC Credit Agreement Amendment, new Debt Financing
Commitment or other definitive agreements with respect thereto (other than any
such breach that is validly waived by the applicable lenders in accordance
with the terms thereof) shall be deemed to be a material and willful breach
of this Agreement.

(d) MCC hereby acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned on or
contingent upon obtaining or closing the Debt Financing or any Alternate Debt
Financing. Any failure of MCC to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as a result of its failure to obtain or close the Debt
Financing or any Alternate Debt Financing, or the unavailability for any
reason (whether or not the fault of MCC) of the Debt Financing or
any Alternate Debt Financing, shall be deemed to be a material and willful
breach of this Agreement.

6.11 _Control Share Acquisition Statute_. If any Takeover Law shall become or
is deemed to be applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby after the date of this Agreement, then MCC, Newco and
members of their respective boards of directors and managers shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate
if possible, and otherwise to minimize, the effects of such Takeover Law on
the Merger, the other transactions contemplated hereby and this Agreement.

6.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. MCC shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause, prior to the Closing, the Merger Shares, and any other MCC Shares
issuable or deliverable hereunder to be approved for listing on The NASDAQ
Stock Market, subject to official notice of issuance. Subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 2.5, MCC agrees to convert, at the request of
the Stockholders Representative, any certificated MCC Shares issued
hereunder into book-entry shares eligible for delivery, clearance and
settlement through The Depository Trust Company.

 

6.13 _Prepayment of Indebtedness_. MCC shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates, to prepay and discharge the principal amount of, and any accrued
and unpaid interest on, the outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries set forth in _Section_

 



66   __ _6.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or that is otherwise required to
be repaid as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any fees or financial penalties (including breakage fees
and make-whole payments) due and payable by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection therewith, in each case concurrently with the
Closing.

 

6.14 _Officer and Director Resignations_. At or prior to Closing, the Company
and DLJ (with respect to the Chilean JV) shall use their reasonable best
efforts to deliver to MCC written resignations, effective as of the Closing
Date, of the directors and officers of the Company and of the Company
Subsidiaries identified by MCC prior to Closing.

 

6.15 _Procedures with Respect to Owned Site Environmental Matters_. Promptly
after the Closing, MCC and the Stockholders Representative will jointly
select an environmental consulting firm of national reputation reasonably
acceptable to each of them (the " _Environmental Engineer_ "). MCC and the
Stockholders Representative shall jointly retain the Environmental Engineer,
and shall instruct the Environmental Engineer to conduct a Phase II subsurface
investigation with respect to the Owned Site having a scope reasonably
acceptable to each of MCC and the Stockholders Representative (the " _Phase
II Subsurface Investigation_ "). MCC shall bear all fees and expenses of the
Environmental Engineer in preparing the Phase II Subsurface Investigation.
Upon the completion of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation, if the Phase II
Subsurface Investigation indicates contamination with Hazardous Substances
that exceed industrial cleanup standards in the state where the Owned Site is
located, additional investigation and remediation will be undertaken, as
appropriate, in, at, on or about the Owned Site to achieve the states
industrial cleanup standards and all reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
if any, shall be performed. If the Phase II Subsurface Investigation indicates
that any discovered matter is required to be reported to any Governmental
Authority, MCC and the Stockholders Representative or its designee shall
jointly discuss with the applicable Governmental Authority any contamination
issue identified in such Phase II Subsurface Investigation for which such
Governmental Authority requires remediation under applicable Environmental
Laws (any remediation obligations resulting from such discussions or arising
because discovered levels of Hazardous Substances exceed the states
industrial cleanup standards, the " _Remediation Obligations_ "). MCC and the
Stockholders Representative shall agree as promptly as practicable based on
estimates received from the Environmental Engineer (and, if requested by
either party, the estimate received from an additional nationally recognized
engineering firm selected by such party) on the estimated cost to complete any
such Remediation Obligations (the " _Estimated Remediation Expense_ "). MCC
and the Stockholders Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts
to direct the Environmental Engineer to achieve the Remediation Obligations
and, if required by any Environmental Law, to receive a closure or no further
action letter or similar documentation from the applicable Governmental
Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable. MCC and the Stockholders
Representative or its designee shall jointly control and guide the process
of fulfilling the Remediation Obligations, and no decisions shall be made
with respect to such matters, and no related communications with the
applicable Governmental Authority shall occur, without the participation and
agreement of each of them. If the Remediation Obligations have in the
reasonable judgment of the Stockholders Representative and MCC been
completed, they shall promptly send a joint notice

 



67  to the Escrow Agent specifying the actual Losses incurred by MCC in
connection with such remediation (the " _Completion Notice_ "). If the
Remediation Obligations have not been completed within 90 days prior to the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, MCC and the Stockholders
Representative shall promptly (and in any event prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date) agree (based on an estimate received from
the Environmental Engineer and, if requested by either party, the estimate
received from an additional nationally recognized engineering firm selected by
such party) on the estimated cost to complete such Remediation Obligations
(the " _Final Remediation Expense_ "). At all times in connection with the
obligations described in this Section 6.15, each of MCC and the Stockholders
Representative shall act reasonably and in good faith.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1 _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained
herein (or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto)
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect for a
period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3
(Capitalization), Section 4.19 (Tax Matters) and Section 5.3 (Capitalization)
shall survive for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date. The
covenants and agreements of the parties in this Agreement that by their terms

agreements of the parties in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are
to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing shall survive for the
period provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully
performed.

 

8.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnifying Company Stockholders and DLJ Indemnification_. Subject to
the provisions of this Section 8.2, the Indemnifying Company Stockholders and
DLJ, severally on the basis described below, shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless MCC, its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving
Company), and their respective Representatives (the " _MCC Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses, whether or not involving any
third party claims, arising out of, resulting from or relating to (i) any
breach, inaccuracy or failure to be true of any representation or warranty of
the Company or DLJ, as applicable, contained in  _Article IV_ , (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of DLJ contained herein (to the extent
required to be performed after the Closing), (iii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement of DLJ or the Company set forth in Section 6.9 (Intercompany
Accounts and Related Party Transactions) or Section 2.9 (Company Options and
Warrants), (iv) any of the Special Indemnification Matters, (v) any Special
Leased Site Environmental Liabilities or (vi) any Special Owned Site
Environmental Liabilities. Except with respect to (A) any Listing
Representations, (B) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.6(a), 

 



70  and (C) the definitions of Assets, Encumbrances, Leased Real Property and
Permitted Encumbrances as included in the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_ , for purposes of determining whether or not any
breaches of representations and warranties of the Company and DLJ contained in
Article IV shall have occurred, under this _Article VIII_ only, the
representations and warranties of such parties shall not be deemed qualified
by any reference to materiality, materially adverse, Material Adverse Effect
or Material Adverse Change or similar effect (which, in each case, instead
will be read as an adverse effect or change). The Indemnifying
Company Stockholders shall, subject to the limitations contained herein, be
solely responsible for Company Indemnifiable Losses, severally and not
jointly, based on their Pro Rata Share of such Losses. With respect to Chilean
JV Indemnifiable Losses, (i) DLJ shall, subject to the limitations contained
herein, be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of any such Losses and (ii) the
Indemnifying Company Stockholders shall, subject to the limitations contained
herein, be responsible for the other fifty percent (50%) of any such Losses,
severally and not jointly, based on their Pro Rata Share of such Losses. DLJ
Indemnifiable Losses shall, subject to the limitations contained herein, be
the sole responsibility of DLJ. Any indemnity claim that is the
responsibility of the Indemnifying Company Stockholders shall be satisfied
from the Company Indemnity Escrow Shares (and, in the case of any Claim with
respect to any Special Owned Site Environmental Liabilities, the Special
Environmental Escrow Shares) pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
any indemnity claim that is the responsibility of DLJ shall be satisfied from
the DLJ Indemnity Escrow Deposit pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. For purposes of determining the number of MCC Shares to be
transferred to MCC out of the General York Escrow Fund or the Special
Environmental Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
MCC Shares shall be valued at the MCC Stock Price as of the date provided for
in the Escrow Agreement.

(b) _MCC and Surviving Company Indemnification_. Subject to the provisions of
this Section 8.2, MCC and the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Company Stockholders, DLJ, their respective Affiliates
(other than, following the Closing, the Company), and their respective
Representatives (the _Stockholder Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
and all Losses, whether or not involving any third party claim, arising out
of, resulting from or relating to (i) any breach, inaccuracy or failure to be
true of any representation or warranty of MCC or Newco contained in Article V
or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of MCC or Newco contained
herein (to the extent required to be performed after the Closing) or any
breach of any covenant or agreement of MCC set forth in Section 2.3 (Actions
at the Closing of the Merger). Except with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.5(b) and the definitions of Encumbrances
and Permitted Encumbrances as included in the representations and warranties
set forth in Article V, for purposes of determining whether or not any
breaches of representations and warranties of MCC and Newco contained in
Article V shall have occurred, under this Article VIII only, the
representations and warranties of such parties shall not be deemed qualified
by any reference to materiality, materially adverse, MCC Material Adverse
Effect or MCC 

 



71  Material Adverse Change, or similar effect (which, in each case, instead
will be read as an adverse effect or change). Any payment by MCC hereunder
shall be paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(c) _Claim Procedure_. If a claim for Losses (a " _Claim_ ") is to be made by
an indemnified party, such indemnified party shall give written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") to (i) the Stockholders Representative and DLJ, in the case
of indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a), and (ii) MCC, in the case of
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (the recipient of such notice
referred to below as the "indemnifying party"), in either case promptly after
such indemnified party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which
may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought under this
Section 8.2, specifying with reasonable detail the amount of such Losses, a
description in reasonable detail of the facts giving raise to such Losses and
the basis of the indemnifying partys responsibility thereof (including the
particular representation, warranty, agreement or covenant in this Agreement
under which such indemnified party believes such liability arises). If
any lawsuit or other action is filed or instituted against any indemnified
party with respect to a matter subject to indemnity hereunder, notice thereof
(a " _Third Party Notice_ ") shall be given to the indemnifying party as
promptly as reasonably practicable. The failure of any indemnified party to
give timely notice hereunder shall not affect such indemnified partys rights
to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent such delay or failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying partys ability to defend such Claim
or mitigate any Losses resulting therefrom. After receipt of a Third Party
Notice, the indemnifying party shall have the right, by providing written
notice to the indemnified party, to (i) take control of the defense and
investigation of such lawsuit or action, (ii) employ and engage attorneys of
its own choice (subject to the approval of the indemnified party, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to handle and defend the same, at
the indemnifying partys sole cost, risk and expense, and (iii) compromise or
settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the
written consent of the indemnified party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld); _provided_ that such consent will not be required if such
settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party and
otherwise provides solely for payment of monetary damages for which the
indemnified party will be indemnified in full. The indemnified party shall,
at the expense of the indemnifying party, cooperate in all reasonable respects
with the indemnifying party and such attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom; and the
indemnified party may, at its own cost, further participate in the
investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal
arising therefrom. If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of
such claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Third Party Notice (or
such earlier date, if the failure to assume the defense on such earlier date
would materially impair the ability of such indemnified party to defend such
claim), the indemnified party against which such claim has been asserted will
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the
right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim and
the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate therein at its own
cost; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the time

 



72  that the indemnifying party assumes the defense hereunder, the indemnified
party may take such actions as are necessary so that its ability to defend
such claim is not materially impaired. The indemnified party shall not
compromise or settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification from
the indemnifying party or admit to any liability with respect to such claim or
demand without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VIII (including
Section 8.2), no indemnifying party shall have any liability under this
Article VIII for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any third
party claim that is settled or compromised by an indemnified party without
the consent of such indemnifying party. The parties agree and acknowledge that
the Stockholders Representatives shall exercise all the rights of the Company
Stockholders and DLJ as indemnifying parties or indemnified parties under
this Section 8.2(c).

(d) _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations of the Indemnifying Company
Stockholders and DLJ_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no MCC Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) with
respect to any claim unless such claim (or series of related claims arising
from the same or substantially similar and concurrent facts or circumstances)
involves a Qualifying Loss (nor shall any such claim that is not a Qualifying
Loss be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of the Losses for which any MCC Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under clause (ii) of this Section 8.2(d) below); (ii) no MCC
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) for any Losses unless and until the amount of all Qualifying Losses
for which all MCC Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a)(i) exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then only for the
aggregate amount of all Qualifying Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount;
(iii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the MCC
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(a) (excluding Section 8.2(a)(vi)) exceed the Indemnification Cap; (iv) in
no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the MCC Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vi)
exceed the lesser of (A) an amount equal to one hundred and fifty percent
(150%) of the Estimated Remediation Expense or (B) when taken together with
the aggregate amount of other Losses for which the MCC Indemnified Parties
are entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the Combined
Indemnification Cap; and (v) no MCC Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Special Leased Site Environmental Liabilities unless
and until the amount of all such Losses for which all MCC Indemnified Parties
are entitled to indemnification exceeds the Special Indemnity Threshold, and
then only for the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of the
Special Indemnity Threshold. The limitations set forth in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.2(d) shall not apply to Losses
attributable to any claim based on a breach, inaccuracy or failure to be true
of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.3 (Capitalization of
the Company).

 



73 (e) _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations of MCC and the
Surviving Company_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Stockholder
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(b)(i) with respect to any claim unless such claim (or series of related
claims arising from the same or substantially similar and concurrent facts or
circumstances) involves a Qualifying Loss (nor shall any such claim that is
not a Qualifying Loss be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating
the aggregate amount of the Losses for which any Stockholder Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification under clause (ii) of this Section
8.2(e) below); (ii) no Stockholder Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i) for any Losses unless and until
the amount of all Qualifying Losses for which all Stockholder Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i) exceeds
the Threshold Amount, and then only for the aggregate amount of all
Qualifying Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; and (iii) in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(b) exceed
the Indemnification Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply to any of MCCs or LabelCorp Holdings obligations
under _Article II_ and _Article III_ hereof to make the payments and take
the other actions required thereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
limitations set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
8.2(e) shall not apply to Losses attributable to any claim based on a
breach, inaccuracy or failure to be true of any representation or warranty
set forth in Section 5.3 (Capitalization of MCC).

(f) _Survival_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no Claim
may be asserted (i) for the breach of any representation, warranty covenant or
agreement contained herein after the expiration of the survival period
applicable to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as
specified in Section 8.1, (ii) with respect to any Special Indemnification
Matter after the eighteenth month anniversary of the Closing Date, or (iii)
with respect to any Special Leased Site Environmental Liabilities or Special
Owned Site Environmental Liabilities after the second anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ that neither Section 8.1 nor this Section 8.2(f)
shall limit the ability of any indemnified party to recover for any Claim
relating to the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
any Special Indemnification Matter, Special Leased Site
Environmental Liabilities or Special Owned Site Environmental Liabilities
asserted in writing prior to the expiration of the survival period applicable
to such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other Claim.

 

8.3 _Other Indemnification Limitations_.

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , the amount of such Losses will be
determined net of any amounts reflected or taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Company Closing Date Net Indebtedness or Final
Chilean JV Closing Date Net Indebtedness.

 



74 (b) In determining the amount of the payment necessary to indemnify any party
against, or reimburse any party for Losses, the amount of the Losses shall be
determined net of any Tax benefit derived (or reasonably expected to be
derived) by the indemnified party (or any Affiliate thereof) as the result of
sustaining or paying such Losses (including as the result of facts or
circumstances due to which the indemnified party sustained or paid such
Losses).

(c) In no event shall an Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified
Party for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive
damages, lost profits, diminution in value or similar items (except for
punitive damages in respect of the matters referred to in clause (i) of the
definition of Special Indemnification Matters).

(d) To the extent an indemnified party is entitled to recover any amounts from
an insurer or any third party with respect to any Losses, such indemnified
party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts to
effect such recovery. If at any time subsequent to receipt by an indemnified
party of an indemnity payment under this _Article VIII_ , such indemnified
party receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment with respect
to the Losses for which it received such indemnity payment, such indemnified
party shall reimburse to the indemnifying parties the net amount recovered. If
an indemnified party receives any payment from an indemnifying party in
respect of any Losses and the indemnified party could have recovered all or a
part of such Losses from a third party based on the underlying claim asserted
against the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall assign such of its
rights to proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit the
indemnifying party to recover from the third party the amount of such payment.

(e) Any indemnified party shall take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Losses incurred by such party upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
indemnification rights hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
extent that the Company or any Company Subsidiary fails to obtain, prior to
the Closing, any of the Licenses set forth on Section 6.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and required under applicable Environmental Law, MCC shall
make all commercially reasonable efforts to apply for and obtain each such
License promptly after the Closing Date.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Indemnifying Company Stockholders nor DLJ shall be required to indemnify or
hold harmless MCC Indemnified Parties with respect to any indemnification
matter arising under Environmental Laws to the extent (i) such matter arises
out of any invasive investigation of environmental conditions, including
testing or sampling, (collectively, " _Environmental Tests_ ") undertaken by
or on behalf of the Surviving Company, the MCC Indemnified Parties or their
Affiliates, unless (A) such Environmental Tests are required under applicable
Law or pursuant to the terms of any lease for the use of any Leased Real
Property or (B) such Environmental Tests are conducted with respect to the
Owned Site;

 



75  or (ii) the Surviving Company, the MCC Indemnified Parties or their
Affiliates (A) remediate environmental conditions in excess of industrial
standards, including standards based on land use restrictions and engineering
controls or (B) incur costs in excess of those reasonably necessary to bring a
condition into compliance with any Environmental Laws existing as of the
Closing Date. MCC and the Stockholders Representative or their designees
shall, with respect to any Special Leased Site Environmental Liabilities,
jointly (1) control any investigation, remediation or cleanup; (2) select
contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence; (3)
contact Governmental Authorities, make any reports to Governmental
Authorities, submit any remedial action or compliance plans to such
authorities, negotiate with such authorities, and otherwise deal with such
authorities; (4) prepare the work plan for any remedial action to be
submitted to a Governmental Authority; (5) approve any written submissions to
any Governmental Authorities; (6) approve the entry into any orders or other
legally binding agreements with any Governmental Authorities, any settlements
with any third parties or any voluntary cleanup program; and (7) diligently
and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. At all times in connection with
the Special Leased Site Environmental Liabilities, each of MCC and the
Stockholders Representative shall act reasonably and in good faith.

(g) To the extent that either party has Knowledge as of the date of this
Agreement based on information Previously Disclosed or contained in MCCs SEC
Reports, no party shall be liable for any Losses pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i) with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of a
representation or warranty in this Agreement with respect to such matter.

 

8.4 _Sole Remedy; Escrow_.

(a) Each party agrees that, from and after the Closing, the sole liability and
obligations of the other party and the sole right, remedy and entitlement of
each party for recovery of any monetary claim with respect to this Agreement
shall be limited to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , and all such
parties hereby waive any and all other statutory and common law rights and
remedies (including other rights of indemnification and contribution) which
the parties have or may hereafter have, _provided_ that such waiver shall in
no event be construed to prevent any party from seeking specific performance
or other equitable relief or remedies or from bringing an action for fraud;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the obligations of the parties under
Sections 6.8 and 8.5(c) shall be excepted from such limitation and waiver. The
parties hereto agree that their respective current, former and
prospective stockholders, investors or limited partners, other Affiliates and
their respective Representatives are not parties to this Agreement, and no
party shall have any right to pursue any claim or seek any legal or equitable
remedy in connection with this Agreement (including, for avoidance of doubt,
monetary damages and specific performance) against any current, former or
prospective stockholder, investor or limited partner, other Affiliate or the
respective Representatives of the other parties hereto, other than claims
brought against parties to this Agreement

 



76  and claims brought against the General York Escrow Fund, the Special
Environmental Escrow Fund or the DLJ Escrow Fund, in each case in accordance
with the terms hereof, and claims brought pursuant to Ancillary Agreements to
which the Company Stockholders are a party in accordance with the terms
thereof.

(b) The MCC Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the limitations contained in
this _Article VIII_ , be entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_
only to the extent of amounts available in the General York Escrow Fund, the
DLJ Escrow Fund and, with respect to Special Owned Site Environmental
Liabilities, the Special Environmental Escrow Fund; it being understood that
such General York Escrow Fund, Special Environmental Escrow Fund and DLJ
Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery and remedy of
any MCC Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ and, as such, the indemnification obligations set forth
in Section 8.2(a) are non-recourse to any Indemnifying Company Stockholder or
DLJ in all respects. Any Chilean JV Indemnifiable Loss shall be satisfied in
equal amounts out of the General York Escrow Fund and the DLJ Escrow Fund, it
being agreed that up to, but not more than, $2,500,000 of the General York
Escrow Fund may be applied to satisfy Chilean JV Indemnifiable Losses;
_provided_ that any Losses relating to the Special Owned Site Environmental
Liabilities shall first be satisfied out of the Special Environmental Escrow
Fund and thereafter shall be satisfied out of the General York Escrow Fund;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Special Environmental Escrow Fund shall only
be used to satisfy Losses relating to any Special Owned Site Environmental
Liabilities. Any DLJ Indemnifiable Loss shall be satisfied out of the DLJ
Escrow Fund. The amounts held in the General York Escrow Fund and the DLJ
Escrow Fund shall be applied in the order Claims related to the applicable
Losses are resolved (i.e., Losses related to Claims resolved at an earlier
date will be satisfied before Losses related to Claims resolved at a later
date).

8.5 _Stockholders  Representative_.

(a) Each of (i) the Company Stockholders, by the requisite approval and
adoption of this Agreement, and the Diamond Castle Entities exercise of the
drag along rights pursuant to the Stockholders Letter Agreement and (ii) DLJ,
irrevocably appoint the Stockholders Representative as their agent and
attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Company Stockholder and DLJ, in
connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Stockholders Representative is authorized: (i) to
take all action necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
or the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which MCC or any other MCC
Indemnified Party may seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII and the
Escrow Agreement, (ii) to prosecute on behalf of the Company Stockholders and
DLJ indemnification claims against MCC or the Surviving Company under this
Article VIII, (iii) to give and receive all notices required to be given
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (iv) to take any and all
additional action as is contemplated to be taken by the Stockholders
Representative or by or on behalf of the 

 



77  Company Stockholders and DLJ by the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the powers conferred above shall not
authorize or empower the Stockholders Representative to do or cause to be
done any of the foregoing in a manner that improperly discriminates between or
among the Company Stockholders and DLJ, and provided further that the
Stockholders Representative shall not be entitled to, and shall not, take
any action that would or could (y) result in the amounts payable hereunder to
any Company Stockholder or DLJ being distributed in any manner other than as
set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or (z) result in any
Company Stockholder or DLJ having any indemnity or other obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
adverse change to the nature of the indemnity obligations), in excess
of those set forth in this _Article VIII_ , without (in each case) such
Company Stockholders or DLJs prior written consent, as applicable.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all decisions and actions by the
Stockholders Representative, including, without limitation, any agreement
between the Stockholders Representative and MCC relating to (i) the defense
or settlement of any claims for which any indemnifying parties may be required
to indemnify any MCC Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement or (ii) the defense or settlement of any
claims for which any indemnifying parties may be required to indemnify any
Stockholder Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ,
shall be binding upon all of the applicable parties, and subject to 8.5(a),
neither any Company Stockholder nor DLJ shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) The Stockholders Representative shall not have any liability to the
Company Stockholders, DLJ, MCC, the Company or their respective Affiliates for
any act done or omitted hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement as
Stockholders Representative (except in the case of willful misconduct or
fraud). The Stockholders Representative shall be indemnified, held harmless
and defended by the Company Stockholders and DLJ from and against all Losses
arising out of or in connection with (i) the Stockholders Representatives
actions taken, or omissions to act, arising out of, in connection with, or
otherwise with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (ii)
actions taken with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement believed
by the Stockholders Representative to be within the scope of its authority;
_provided_ that such Losses do not arise out of the willful misconduct
or fraud of the Stockholders Representative. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Stockholders Representative is a party to this Agreement
solely for the convenience of the parties in connection with the performance
of the duties described in this Section 8.5 and for no other purpose.

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by Law and (i) with respect to the
Company Stockholders, as a result of exercise of the drag along rights under
the Investors Shareholders Agreement and the Management Shareholders
Agreement, and 

 



78  (ii) with respect to DLJ, as a result of this Agreement, the Stockholders
Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf of each Company
Stockholder and DLJ to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and
all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the
Company Stockholders and DLJ under this _Article VIII_ and the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(e) Each of DLJ, by its execution of this Agreement, and each Company
Stockholder, by his, her or its approval of the Merger and this Agreement,
and as a result of exercise of the drag along rights under the Management
Shareholders Agreement and the Investors Shareholders Agreement, in addition
to the foregoing, agrees and acknowledges that:

 

(1) MCC and any other MCC Indemnified Party shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Stockholders
Representative as to (A) the settlement of any claims for indemnification by
MCC or such MCC Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , (B) the
settlement of any claims for indemnification by any Stockholder Indemnified
Party or DLJ pursuant to this _Article VIII_ or (C) any other actions required
or permitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative hereunder or
under the Escrow Agreement, and neither DLJ nor any Company Stockholder or
Stockholder Indemnified Party shall have any cause of action against MCC or
such MCC Indemnified Party for any action taken by MCC or such MCC Indemnified
Party in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Stockholders
Representative;

(2) all actions, decisions and instructions of the
Stockholders Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon DLJ, all of
the Company Stockholders and the Stockholder Indemnified Parties and neither
DLJ nor any Company Stockholder or Stockholder Indemnified Party shall have
any cause of action against the Stockholders Representative for any action
taken, decision made or instruction given by the Stockholders Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except for fraud or willful
misconduct by the Stockholders Representative in connection with the matters
described in this Section 8.5;

(3) the provisions of this Section 8.5 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that DLJ or any Company Stockholder may
have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(4) remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of
this Section 8.5 are inadequate; therefore, MCC shall be entitled to seek
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
damages if MCC brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Section 8.5.

 



79 (f) The provisions of this Section 8.5 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees,
successors and Stockholder Indemnified Parties of DLJ and each Company
Stockholder, and any references in this Agreement to DLJ, a Company
Stockholder or the Company Stockholders shall mean and include the successors
to the rights of DLJ or the Company Stockholders hereunder (and, with respect
to this _Article VIII_ , their Stockholder Indemnified Parties), whether
pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise.

11.3 _Public Announcements_. The content and timing of any initial press
release with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether issued as a joint press release or as individual press releases by
each of the Company, DLJ and MCC) shall be agreed to by each of the Company,
DLJ and MCC and thereafter each of the Company, DLJ and MCC agree to consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except for any press releases and public announcements the making
of which may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation.

11.4  _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

11.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the essential economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Ancillary Agreements,
the Company Disclosure Letter, the MCC Disclosure Letter, and the other
Exhibits hereto) constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and except as otherwise expressly
provided herein.

 

11.7 _Assignment_. Neither the Company nor DLJ shall assign this Agreement
without the prior written consent of MCC, and MCC shall not assign this
Agreement without the prior written consent of DLJ and the Company (prior to
the Closing) or the Stockholders Representative (after the Closing);
_provided_ , _however_ , that without the consent of the Company (prior to
the Closing) or the Stockholders Representative (after the Closing), MCC may
assign

 



85  its rights hereunder in whole or in part to any Person providing financing
to MCC for the transactions contemplated hereby as security therefore. For the
avoidance of doubt, a change of control of MCC or any direct or indirect
parent of MCC shall not be deemed an assignment for purposes of this
Agreement. Any purported assignment or other transfer in violation of this
Agreement shall be void and unenforceable.

 

11.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto, the Company Stockholders (provided that only the
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to take action under this
Agreement on behalf of the Company Stockholders), the Indemnified DandO Parties,
the MCC Indemnified Parties, the Stockholder Indemnified Parties and their
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lenders, the
arrangers of the Debt Financing and their respective Affiliates, successors
and assigns are express third-party beneficiaries of the proviso in the last
sentence of Section 6.10(a), Section 10.2, Section 11.7, the last sentence of
Section 11.10, the last sentence of Section 11.11 and Section 11.12, and shall
be entitled to enforce the provisions of such sections to the
extent applicable to such persons.

11.9 _Waivers and Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and
the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument
signed by MCC and the Company (prior to Closing) or the Stockholders
Representative (from and after the Closing) or, in the case of a waiver, by
the party waiving compliance;  _provided_ that this Agreement may not be
amended in a manner that would, by its terms, have a disproportionate adverse
effect on the rights or obligations of DLJ compared to the rights and
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (excluding the
Chilean JV and its Subsidiaries) or the Company Stockholders, without the
consent of DLJ. No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege hereunder,
nor any single or partial exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

11.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled: (i)
without posting a bond or similar security, to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and (ii) to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, in either case, in any federal court located in
the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court or any other court having
jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
Company, DLJ or any of their respective Affiliates be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically against the Lenders, the arrangers of the Debt
Financing or any of their respective Affiliates MCCs obligations under
Section 6.10; provided that nothing contained herein shall limit the rights of
the parties to the MCC Credit Agreement or the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment
under the terms thereof.

 



86 11.11 _Governing Law; etc_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that state, without regard to the conflicts
of laws principles thereof to the extent the same would require the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction. The parties agree that any
Actions seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware
or the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such
court or that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 11.2 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim, third party claim or any claim or any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise against any of the Lenders or arrangers of the Debt Financing or
their respective Affiliates in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the MCC Credit Agreement or
the MCC Credit Agreement Amendment or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof).

 

11.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE MCC CREDIT AGREEMENT OR THE MCC
CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH
PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 11.12.

 



87 11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
