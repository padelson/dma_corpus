<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to
commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted
under this Agreement, the &#147;<B>Offer</B>&#148;)
to purchase all of the outstanding common shares, par value $0.10 per share, of
the Company (the &#147;<B>Company Common Stock</B>&#148;),

different amount per share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, the &#147;<B>Offer Price</B>&#148;), net to the seller in cash,
without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company with the Company surviving that merger as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;),

amended (the &#147;<B>BCL</B>&#148;), pursuant to
which each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than (i)
shares of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company and (ii) the Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the board of directors of the Company (the &#147;<B>Company

herein, (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer, and, if required, approval of
the Merger by the Company&#146;s shareholders; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Offer and
the Merger. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided
that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to <B>Article VIII</B>, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) use its reasonable best efforts to commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;<B>Exchange Act</B>&#148;)) the Offer within three (3)
Business Days (and shall commence such Offer in any event within ten (10)
Business Days) of the date of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to: (i) there being
validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior to any then
scheduled Expiration Time that number of shares of Company Common Stock which,
together with the shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any),
represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares as of immediately
prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended and re-extended in
accordance with this <B>Section 1.01</B>)
(the &#147;<B>Minimum Condition</B>&#148;); and
(ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other
conditions and requirements set forth in <B>Exhibit
A</B>, as such conditions may be modified in accordance with this
Agreement (together with the Minimum Condition, the &#147;<B>Offer Conditions</B>&#148;). For purposes of determining whether the
Minimum Condition has been satisfied, any shares tendered in the Offer pursuant
to guaranteed delivery procedures shall be included only if such shares have
been delivered pursuant to such procedures. Subject to the prior satisfaction
of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger
Sub, of the other Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, consummate the Offer in accordance with
its terms and accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock

Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the &#147;<B>Offer to Purchase</B>&#148;) that describes the
terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement, including the
Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (in their
sole discretion) to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition, to

anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been
