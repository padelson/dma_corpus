 (b) The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, together with the shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01) (the "Minimum Condition"); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Exhibit A, as such conditions may be modified in accordance with this Agreement (together with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, any shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures shall be included only if such shares have been delivered pursuant to such procedures. Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as 

   practicable after the Expiration Time. The Offer Price payable in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without
interest (subject to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 3.05), on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to any shareholders of the Company, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.01, extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer or (vi) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the other terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to any shareholder of the Company. 

  

 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "Initial Expiration Time") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this Agreement, is referred to as the "Expiration Time"). 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition) shall not be satisfied or waived, until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum number of days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to this clause (i) shall be twenty (20) Business Days, (ii) extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days each, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Time each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived, and the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum number of days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be twenty (20) Business Days, (iii) extend the 

   Offer, at the request of the Company, until the expiration of a twenty
(20)-day cure period after a breach of this Agreement by the Company, if on
any then-scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions (other than
the Minimum Condition) shall not be satisfied due to a breach of this
Agreement by the Company that is capable of being cured (it being understood
that a willful failure to comply with Section 6.04 in any material respect
shall be deemed incapable of being cured), and (iv) extend the Offer for the
minimum period required by applicable Law, any interpretation or position of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the staff thereof, the
NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") or the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. applicable
to the Offer, and until any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and any other
applicable foreign antitrust, competition or similar Law shall have expired
or been terminated; _provided, however,_ that in no event (A) shall Merger
Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond November 1, 2012 (the "Outside
Date") or (B) shall this Section 1.01(e) be construed or deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII. Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing,
make available one (1) or more "subsequent offering periods" in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents may, in
Merger Subs sole discretion, provide for such a reservation of right. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 1.01(e), the rights of Company
to cause an extension of the Offer are cumulative so that, if at any time any
of the foregoing is applicable, the Offer will be so extended further.

  

 (f) On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay the Offer Price (subject to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 3.05) pursuant to Section 1.01(b) for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions upon the Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date." 

  

 (g)  Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, prior to the acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock tendered in the 

   Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days), and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub
to promptly return, all tendered Company Common Stock to the registered
holders thereof.

  

 (h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that may be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, relating to the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments. 

  

 Section 1.02 Company Actions. 

  

 (a) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, contain and reflect the recommendation described in Section 4.03(d). The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent 

   required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to
the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that
may be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company
for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9,
and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, relating to the Schedule 14D-9. Unless the Company
Board has effected a change in the recommendation described in Section
4.03(d), prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments
or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the
shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation
contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

  

 (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub mailing labels, security position listings and any other available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of all record holders or beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such information and assistance (including lists of record holders or beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock, updated from time to time upon Parents, Merger Subs or either of their respective agents reasonable request, and the addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions of such record holders or beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Sub or either of their respective agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents and Representatives 

   to deliver) to the Company or destroy all copies and any extract or summaries
of such information then in their possession or control.

  

 Section 1.03 Directors.

  

 (a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.03(a)) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the number of directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee of the Company Board requested by Parent, and (B) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) as reasonably requested by Parent, in each case that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board. 

  

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions reasonably required to effect the appointment of Parents designees, including mailing to its shareholders information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03(b), which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under Section 1.03(a) hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such information. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent (the "Independent Directors") (or the approval of the sole Independent Director if there shall only be one Independent Director) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement (including any decrease or change in the form of the Offer Price), (iii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub and (iv) any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions 

   contained herein for the benefit of the Company; _provided_  that if there
shall be no Independent Directors as a result of such individuals deaths,
disabilities, resignations or refusals to serve, then such actions may be
effected by a majority vote of the Company Board. The Independent Directors
will have the authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company) and other advisors at the reasonable expense of the Company
as determined appropriate by the Independent Directors for the purpose of
fulfilling their obligations hereunder. Following the election or appointment
of Parents designees pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and until the
Effective Time, any action by the Company to enforce any obligation of Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement shall be effected only by the action of a
majority of the Independent Directors (or the approval of the sole
Independent Director if there shall only be one Independent Director);
_provided_  that if there shall be no Independent Directors as a result of
such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusals to serve,
then such actions may be effected by a majority vote of the Company Board.

  

 Section 1.04 Top-Up Option. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.04, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer, that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 80% of the Fully Diluted Shares immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (the "Short Form Threshold"); _provided_ , that the Top-Up Option will not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares); _provided, further_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued or held in the treasury of the Company at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares were outstanding) and (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by any Law or Order. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in part, at any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earliest to occur of (A) the close of business on the fifth Business Day following the Offer Closing, (B) the Effective Time and (C) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the 

   time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing) and (ii) a place and
a time for the closing of such purchase which shall, unless the Independent
Directors otherwise agree, be at the Companys principal offices not less
than one (1) Business Day after receipt of such notice. The Company shall,
promptly following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger
Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its
notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub. At the
closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the aggregate purchase price owed
by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up Shares (calculated by multiplying
the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer Price) shall be paid to
the Company at Parents election, either (i) entirely in cash, by wire
transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by issuing to the Company a promissory
note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant
to the Top-Up Option (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i) shall
bear simple interest at a rate of three percent (3.0%) per annum, (ii) shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution of the Promissory
Note, (iii) shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be
prepaid, at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and
(v) shall have no other material terms. The Company shall cause to be issued
to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company
does not then have certificated shares of Company Stock, the
applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry
Shares may include any legends that are required by federal or state
securities Laws.

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that any Top-Up Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") and that all such shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

  

 (d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or the payment by Merger Sub to the Company of consideration for the Top-Up Shares, will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Subchapter 15D of the BCL as contemplated by Section 3.03. 

  

 (e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 1.04(e) will be null and void. 

   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, at any time after the Offer Closing and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub, together with any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parents other Affiliates, equal or exceed the Short Form Threshold, then each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will take all actions necessary and appropriate to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer without a meeting of the Companys shareholders, in accordance with Section 1924(b) of the BCL.

ARTICLE III 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

 Section 3.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company: 

  

 (a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other 

   than (i) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section
3.01(a), and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to
receive, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price
(the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all shares of Company Common
Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to
Section 3.03, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such
shares (each, a "Certificate") will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.02 hereof.

  

 (c) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each common share, no par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable common share of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the Companys transfer agent (or such other financial institution to which the Company and Parent agree) (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i) the Certificates, and (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Book-Entry Shares"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Exchange Agent to be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (the "Payment Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated "A-1" or "P-1" or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to, or as directed by, Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares shall be entitled under Section 3.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable, but in event no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder 

   of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree and shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates, or Loss Documentation in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 3.06, or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration.

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and subject to the terms set forth in Section 3.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, each Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III. 

   (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 180 days after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any amounts that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 Section 3.03 Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.01, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by a Dissenting Shareholder ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each Dissenting Shareholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except that the Dissenting Shareholders shall have the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the BCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting Shareholder who, after the Effective Time, effectively withdraws or loses his or her dissenters rights pursuant to the BCL, shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(b), without any interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book Entry Share, as the case may be. As used in this Agreement, the term "Dissenting Shareholder" means any record holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock who is statutorily entitled to exercise appraisal rights and who duly complies with all provisions of the BCL concerning the right of holders of Company Common Stock to dissent from the Merger and seek appraisal of their shares. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to the applicable provisions of the BCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the BCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and, after the Offer Closing, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to dissenters rights under the 

   BCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

  

 Section 3.04 Adjustments.

 Section 3.05 Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and applicable Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 3.06 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent may reasonably direct (such affidavit and, if requested by Parent, posting of a bond, the "Loss Documentation"), as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article III.

In the event that the per share exercise price (with respect to stock options) or base amount (with respect to stock appreciation rights) of such Company Stock Right is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Right will be cancelled without consideration and have no further force or effect. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award, restricted stock award, performance share unit award and other right, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock held, awarded, outstanding, or payable under any Company Stock Plan, other than Company Stock Rights and options issued under the ESPP to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Award") immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Award or any other Person, cancelled and, except with respect to performance share unit awards that are forfeited at the Effective Time without payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreements on the date hereof, converted into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereof), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such Company Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.05, subject, however, with respect to holders of restricted stock awards, to any rights of such holder pursuant to Section 3.03. For purposes of this Section 3.07(b), the performance share unit awards that are forfeited at the Effective Time without payment shall include all performance share unit awards other than those performance share unit 

   awards that vest at target level in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable award agreements in effect on the date hereof.

  

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and amendments and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any employee consents that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 3.07.

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign 

   corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature or
conduct of its business makes such qualification or license necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

 Section 5.02 Capital Structure of Merger Sub. As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, no par value per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.03 Authority; Non-contravention; Governmental Consents. 

  

 (a) Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement and instrument required by this Agreement to be entered into and performed by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, with this Agreement, the "Parent Transaction Documents") and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each other Parent Transaction Document by Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by each Parent Transaction Document have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and each other Parent Transaction Document have been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable (or, in the case of any Parent Transaction Document to be executed and delivered hereafter, each such Parent Transaction Document will have been duly executed and delivered as of the Closing Date) and, assuming due execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement and each other Parent Transaction Document constitute (or, in the case of any Parent Transaction Document to be executed and delivered hereafter, each such Parent Transaction Document will constitute) the valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. 

   No vote of any of the holders of capital stock of Parent is required to
authorize or consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (b) Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Parent Transaction Documents by Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, do not and will not directly or indirectly (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or both): (i) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub or any effective resolutions of the board of directors of Parent or Merger Sub or any committee thereof; (ii) subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 5.03(c), conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of the respective properties or assets owned, used or purported to be owned or used by them; (iii) require any consent, approval or other action of any Person under, or conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become a breach or default) under, any Contract to which Parent or its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, are a party or otherwise bound; or (iv) result in the creation, imposition or modification of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on or with respect to any of the material properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of each of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for any contraventions, conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or Liens, or where the failure to obtain any Consents, in each case, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (c) Governmental Consents. No Consent of any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the other Parent Transaction Documents or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for: (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; (ii) such filings with the SEC as may be required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with the Exchange Act in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) such Consents as may be required under Antitrust Laws, in any case that are applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) such Consents as may be required under applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ; and (v) such other Consents which if not obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 5.04 Information in the Proxy Statement. None of the information with respect to Parent or Merger Sub that Parent or any of its Representatives supplies in writing to the Company for use in the Company Proxy Statement, if any (and any 

   amendment or supplement thereto), at the date such Company Proxy Statement is
first mailed to the Companys shareholders or at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  

 Section 5.05 Information in the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not, when filed with the SEC and at the time of distribution or dissemination thereof to the Companys shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made therein supplied by the Company or its Representatives expressly for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable federal securities Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

  

 Section 5.06 Financing. Parent has, or will have as of the Offer Closing, and will cause Merger Sub to have, at the Offer Closing and prior to the Effective Time, sufficient funds (including cash, cash equivalents, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds) to pay the aggregate Offer Price and the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement and to perform the other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The Commitment Letter, by its terms, shall remain in effect through at least November 1, 2012. The Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, the other parties thereto. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters and engagement letters, complete copies of which have been provided to the Company (in the case of such fee letters, with only the fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which concern or would adversely affect the amount, availability, timing or conditionality of (or contain any conditions precedent to) the Financing) redacted)) relating to the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements hereunder 

   in all material respects, as of the date of this Agreement neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has any reason to believe that Merger Sub would be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Commitment Letter
required to be satisfied by it. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, Parent
has no knowledge of any direct or indirect limitation or other restriction on
the ability of the lender parties to the Commitment Letter to provide
financing for other potential purchasers of the Company.

  

 Section 5.07 Legal Proceedings. There is no Legal Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or any of their respective assets, nor is there any Order imposed upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, which would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or materially and adversely affect Parent or Merger Subs ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by any Parent Transaction Document. 

  

 Section 5.08 Absence of Certain Agreements. Except as disclosed by Parent to the Company in writing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), (a) with any officer or director of the Company in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) pursuant to which (i) any shareholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration or any shareholder of the Company (A) agrees to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer or to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (B) agrees to vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any Superior Proposal or (ii) any third party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity capital to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in part the Offer or the Merger. Parent has, prior to the date of this Agreement, delivered or made available to the Company a complete and correct copy (or, in the case of any oral agreement or arrangement, a written summary) of any agreement or arrangement required to be disclosed by Parent to the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence. 

  

 Section 5.09 BCL Section 2553. Neither Parent or Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has either Parent or Merger Sub been, an "interested shareholder" of the Company as defined in Section 2553 of the BCL.

operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time, in each case, as reasonably requested by Parent.

possession or control of the Company or any of its Affiliates), regardless of
the limitations of the Confidentiality Agreement Addendum, and shall
cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in providing such notices or seeking
such Consents (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement Addendum)
thereunder as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in a timely manner.

offer or indication of interest that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Takeover Proposal,

provisions of any Takeover Statute (including any transaction under, or a
Person becoming an "interested shareholder" under, the BCL), or any
restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the
Companys Charter Documents, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by
a Takeover Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company
shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have
been previously granted to any Person other than Parent or any of its
Affiliates under any such provisions), or (vi) execute or enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other Contract relating to a Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in connection with the actions
contemplated by, and pursuant to, Section 6.04(b)) (any such Contract
referred to in this clause (vi), a "Company Acquisition Agreement") or
resolve, agree, approve, recommend or publicly propose to take such action.
Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 6.04, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) fail to make the Company
Board Recommendation, (B) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, endorse or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or enter into any
Company Acquisition Agreement or resolve, agree, approve, recommend or
publicly propose to take any such action, or (C) withdraw, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (any of the foregoing clauses (A), (B)
and (C) above, a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); it being
understood and agreed that any "stop-look-listen" communication by the
Company Board to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act (or any related communication to shareholders of the
Company) will not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct and use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or
knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue, any and all
existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall
request and use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such third party (or
its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to promptly return or destroy (and confirm

   destruction of) all such information to the extent the Company has the
contractual right to do so under the applicable confidentiality agreement.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to compliance with Sections 6.04(c) and 6.04(d), (i) (A) in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.04(a), (1) contact the Person making such Takeover Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material contingencies and the likelihood of consummation to make the determinations described in the definition of "Superior Proposal," (2) furnish non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (3) engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal, and (B) if requested by a third party that has entered into a confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement with the Company prior to the date hereof (including where such request is prohibited under the terms of the applicable confidentiality and standstill agreement), waive any prohibition with respect to the submission of a Takeover Proposal or amendment thereto in any such agreement, in any such case, if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a material event, development or change in circumstance (other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal) that is unknown by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company shall provide Parent with no fewer than four (4) days notice of any Company Adverse Recommendation Change prior to such change (and during such four (4) day period, the Company agrees that the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any such revisions to the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent), (iii) if the Company Board determines in response to a Takeover Proposal that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a) and/or make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in the case of a termination, the Company shall, substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, enter 

   into the Company Acquisition Agreement implementing such Superior Proposal (
_provided_ , that in the event of any such termination, the Company complies
with its obligations to pay the Termination Fee in Section 8.06(b))
and/or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
the Company to take (which order remains unstayed). Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to the Companys shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the shareholders of the Company with regard to a Takeover
Proposal, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to do so could
reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law or would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

 (c) The Company shall, as promptly as possible and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof, (i) notify Parent in writing of the receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of any Takeover Proposal or request for information or inquiry, in each case, from any third party, that expressly contemplates or that the Company believes would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any change to the financial terms, conditions or other material terms thereof and the terms of any and all agreements in connection therewith (including any financial arrangements)). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of any related material developments, discussions and negotiations related to any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and shall make available to Parent all material non-public information made available to any Person making any such Takeover Proposal at substantially the same time as it provides such information to such other Person. 

  

 (d) The Company may not enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, unless: (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least four (4) days (the "Notice Period") before entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt basis); (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision to price or form of consideration or any material change to other terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior to the Companys effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or 

   terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a), the Notice Period
shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business
Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies
Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be
multiple extensions)); and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consulting with its outside legal counsel and its Company Financial
Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the
Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

 Section 6.05 Shareholders Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Materials. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, if the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is required under applicable Law, the Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Offer Closing, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance of such meeting. The record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting shall be determined in prior consultation with and subject to the prior written approval of Parent (which prior written approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.04(b) hereof, the Company shall (i) solicit or cause to be solicited from its shareholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement, and (ii) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Requisite Vote (including, at the request of Parent, postponing or adjourning the Company Shareholders Meeting to obtain a quorum or solicit additional proxies). Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.04(b) hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries shall hold, in the aggregate, at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 1924(b)(1)(ii) of the BCL. If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is required by applicable Law, unless this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall be obligated to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting, and submit this Agreement to its shareholders for adoption, regardless of whether a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred. 

   (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall as soon as practicable prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered in good faith by the Company). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company shall consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC comments with respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement. 

  

 (c) Parent will cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting. Parent and Merger Sub will not, and they will cause their direct and indirect Subsidiaries not to, sell, transfer, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, if required. 

  

 Section 6.06 Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company, promptly of (a) any material notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including a copy of such notice or communication to the extent in writing), (b) any notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity in 

   connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including a
copy of such notice or communication to the extent in writing), (c) any Legal
Actions commenced, or to such partys knowledge, threatened, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, that are related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (d) any change that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable. In addition, the Company shall
notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the
Company, promptly after obtaining knowledge of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause any condition
(including any of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A) to the obligations of
the other party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of the other party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the delivery of any such notice shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to comply with any
covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  

 Section 6.07 Employees; Benefit Plans. 

  

 (a) Continuing Employees. This Section shall apply to each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is classified by the Company or such Subsidiary as a regular full-time employee, whose terms and conditions of employment are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement and who is employed in such capacity by the Company or such Subsidiary at the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Continuing Employees").

  

 (b) Comparability of Compensation and Benefits. For the period beginning at the Offer Closing and ending on a date not earlier than the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide to each Company Continuing Employee base salary, wages, bonus opportunities (but without regard to the timing of the payment of any bonus, performance goals or targets or duration of the performance period to which the bonus relates) and employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation arrangements), that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the pay, bonus opportunities and employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation arrangements) provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the employment of any Company Continuing Employee is terminated at or within one year of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide to such terminated employee severance benefits that are no less than the severance benefits that would have been provided to such employee upon such a termination of employment immediately 

   prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, all severance and
termination agreements with Company Continuing Employees listed on Section
6.07(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall remain in full force and
effect solely to the extent provided in such agreements and subject to the
terms and conditions of such agreements.

  

 (c) Service Credit and Paid Time Off. 

  

 (i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to give each Company Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of level of benefits (but not benefit accrual under any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) under the employee benefit plans and arrangements (including employee benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, vacation, paid time off and severance plans or arrangements) maintained or sponsored by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Company Continuing Employees participate after the Effective Time for services rendered by such Company Continuing Employees to Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time provided, however, that no such credit shall result in an unintended duplication of benefits or be required to be recognized under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation generally. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject only to any required approval of the applicable insurance provider: (a) each Company Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in any and all compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof providing benefits to the Company Continuing Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement without any waiting time to participate in any New Plan other than any New Plan that includes a cash or deferred feature intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "New 401(k) Plan"), and with a waiting period of up to the first payroll date following the first full month following the Effective Time for any New 401(k) Plan; and (b) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the Effective Time, to, by operation of law or otherwise, 

   assume, honor and be responsible for paying, providing and satisfying when
due, including payment in respect thereto upon any subsequent termination of
employment of such employees by Parent or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time, all vacation, personal days, sick pay and other paid time off
for Company Continuing Employees accrued, but unused, through the Effective
Time on terms and conditions not less favorable than the terms and conditions
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such
satisfaction would result in an unintended duplication of benefits.

  

 (d) Company 401(k) Plans. Unless otherwise notified by Parent in writing prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code ("Company 401(k) Plans"), effective immediately prior to the Offer Closing. If Parent provides notice to the Company not to terminate the Company 401(k) Plans pursuant to the foregoing sentence, then if requested by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company 401(k) Plans, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In either case, if the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence of such termination pursuant to resolution of the Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Offer Closing Date or the Effective Time, as applicable. In the event of any such termination, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any New 401(k) Plan to accept direct rollovers from such Company 401(k) Plan with respect to accounts of the Company Continuing Employees, which rollover may consist of cash, a promissory note (as described below) or any combination thereof from such Company 401(k) Plan. The Company shall ensure that the Company 401(k) Plan does not permit any new loans on or after the termination date and does not place any then existing loans of any Company Continuing Employees under the Company 401(k) Plan in default solely by reason of the termination of such plan so long as such participant continues to repay the loan and transfers such participants account balance under such terminated Company 401(k) Plan, together with the promissory note evidencing the plan loan and the applicable loan documentation, to the New 401(k) Plan through a direct rollover in accordance with procedures established by the New 401(k) Plan. 

  

 (e) Third Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding Section 9.09, the provisions of this Section 6.07 are intended to be for the sole benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the parties hereto, and nothing in this Section 6.07, whether express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any participant in any New Plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof. 

  

 (f) Limitations. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or 

   arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, so long as any
such amendment, modification or termination is consistent with the provisions
of this Section 6.07. If (A) a party other than the parties hereto makes a
claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to any New Plan, and (B) such provision is deemed to be an
amendment to such New Plan even though not explicitly designated as such in
this Agreement, then, solely with respect to such New Plan, such provision
shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with respect
thereto. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this Section 6.07 shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment with the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.

  

 Section 6.08 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or at any time is or has been serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, fiduciary or trustee of a Company Employee Plan (each an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and as provided or made available to Parent prior to the date hereof and disclosed on Section 6.08 of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such Indemnified Parties, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim. 

  

 (b)  For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the "Indemnifying Parties") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), obligations, judgments, fines and settlements (in the case of settlements, with the approval of an Indemnifying Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (collectively, "Losses") arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall promptly advance to each Indemnified Party any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such Losses as such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an 

   undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnifying Party shall be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant hereto if it shall be determined by
a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified
Party acted in bad faith and not in a manner such Indemnified Party believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company.

  

 (c) The Company shall purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than those of the directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium therefor is not in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which aggregate premiums with respect to 2011 are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be approximately $765,000). Such tail policy may not be amended, modified, cancelled or revoked after the Offer Closing by the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in any manner that is adverse to the beneficiaries. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.08 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.08 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.08, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.08). 

  

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.08. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 

  



   Section 6.09 Reasonable Best Efforts. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including those contained in this Section 6.09), each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary permits, waivers, consents, approvals and actions or nonactions from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the obtaining of all material consents or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably requested by the other party hereto or necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Each party hereto shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply the other with any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking of such actions. To the extent reasonably practicable, the parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. Each party hereto shall promptly inform and provide a copy to the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party hereto receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to any filing or submission or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Each party hereto shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication to, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filing or any such transaction. To the extent reasonably practicable, no party hereto shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the opportunity of the other party to attend or participate. To the extent 

   permitted by applicable Law, the parties to this Agreement will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearance,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in connection with
proceedings under or related to the HSR Act. Any action taken by the Company
that is permissible under Section 6.04 shall not be a violation of this
Section 6.09(a).

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section 6.09(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement ( _provided that_ in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such filing shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

  

 (c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates be obligated to sell, transfer or otherwise divest any of its assets, properties or businesses (including assets, properties or businesses that were assets, properties or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) or enter into any agreements providing for any such sale, transfer or other divesture or restricting or limiting in any way or to any extent the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from engaging in any business anywhere in the world, other than the sale, transfer or divestiture of no more than five (5) store locations of the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries that Parent, in its reasonable discretion, determines is _de minimis_ to the business or operations of the Company or Parent, as applicable, taken as a whole. 

  

 Section 6.10 Financing. 

   (a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not incur any liability to any Person under, nor (except as expressly set forth in Section 6.11 below) have any obligations with respect to, any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except that at the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries may become liable in respect of the debt financing documents contemplated by the executed commitment letter from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, including any related fee letter with only the fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which concern or would adversely affect the amount, availability, timing or conditionality of (or contain any conditions precedent to) the Financing) redacted (collectively, the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein on the terms set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Financing"). Further, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing, except to the extent arising from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, its Affiliates and/or any of its Representatives.

  

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (ii) satisfy, or cause their respective Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives that are within their respective control in such definitive agreements, and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, cause the lenders and any other Persons providing the Financing to fund the Financing at the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and the Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger).

  

 (c) Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to, or grant any waiver of, any condition or other provision under the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing such that Parent would not have sufficient funds (including cash, cash equivalents, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds) to pay the aggregate Offer Price and the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement and to perform the other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) impose new or additional 

   conditions that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay in any
material respect the ability of Parent to consummate the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under
the Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an
individual lender under the terms of or in connection with the syndication of
the Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the Commitment
Letter.

  

 (d) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, (i) Parent shall promptly so notify the Company upon obtaining knowledge thereof and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative financial institutions in an amount, together with other sources available to Parent, sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon conditions not materially less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company than those in the Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the Offer Closing Date or the Closing Date, as applicable). The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.10(d) are referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as the "Financing Agreements."

  

 (e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining or consummation of the Financing or any alternative financing, is a condition to the Offer Closing or the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the Offer Conditions and the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7.01, the breach of which obligation will give rise to the remedies set forth in Section 9.13.

  

 (f) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any material breach or material threatened breach by any party of any of the Commitment Letter, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof or refusal to provide in full, or stated intent to refuse to provide in full, in each case, to the extent required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the financing contemplated by the Financing Agreements, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing), provided that Parent shall be under no obligation to disclose any information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar privilege. 

   Section 6.11 Financing Cooperation. Subject to Section 6.10(a), the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole expense, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or alternative financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or utilize an undue amount of the Companys or Subsidiaries personnel time). Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, such cooperation by the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (a) participating in a reasonable number of meetings and presentations with prospective lenders (including using reasonable best efforts to make available the Companys senior management for participation in such meetings), (b) using reasonable best efforts to provide information (including any information necessary to facilitate preparation of projections and the pro forma financial statements required pursuant to the Securities Act (including Article XI of Regulation S-X) in connection with the Merger), documents, authorization letters, opinions and certificates, enter into agreements and take other actions that are customary in connection with the Financing or alternative financing or necessary or desirable to permit Parent to fulfill conditions or obligations under the definitive documentation for the Financing or the alternative financing, (c) furnishing the report of the Companys auditor on the most recently available audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of such report in accordance with normal custom and practice, (d) using reasonable best efforts to assist in the preparation of one or more confidential information memoranda and other marketing and syndication materials reasonably requested by Parent and (e) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist in procuring any necessary rating agency ratings or approvals. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logos in connection with the Financing or any alternative Financing, provided that such use is disclosed to the Company in writing prior to the time that it is so used, such logos are used in a manner that could not reasonably be expected to harm or disparage the Company, its Subsidiaries or their marks and on such other customary terms and conditions as the Company or applicable Subsidiary shall reasonably impose. Parent shall, promptly upon termination of this Agreement, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in connection with the Companys or its Affiliates obligations under this Section 6.11. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing) prior to the Effective Time. All material non-public information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to the lenders in respect of the Commitment Letter and other potential sources of capital, rating agencies and prospective lenders and 

   investors during syndication of the Financing or any alternative Financing
subject to the lenders, potential sources of capital, ratings agencies and
prospective lenders and investors entering into customary confidentiality
undertakings with respect to such information (including through a notice and
undertaking in a form customarily used in confidential information memoranda
for senior credit facilities).

  

 Section 6.12 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with and obtain the approval of each other before issuing any press release or other public announcements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or public announcement prior to such consultation and approval, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the trading of the shares of either party on any securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which case, the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement; _provided_ that neither consultation nor approval shall be required with respect to any release or announcement permitted by Section 6.04. 

  

 Section 6.13 Takeover Statutes. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Offer, the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing. Neither Parent nor the Company will take any action that would cause this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to requirements imposed by any such Laws. 

  

 Section 6.14 Merger Sub. Parent shall (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness.

The Company Board has determined that Companys compensation committee is composed solely of "independent directors" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto. 

  

 Section 6.18 Convertible Notes.

The Company shall not make an irrevocable Physical Settlement Election (as such term is defined in the Indenture).

   doubt, any notices or opinions of counsel and other actions necessary to
allow Parent to execute a supplemental indenture and become the Companys
successor under the Indenture in accordance with its terms. The Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on all such notices and other communications to holders of
the Convertible Notes, the Trustee or any depository, prior to their
delivery, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company
shall provide Parent with copies of all such notices and other
communications. The Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with advance
notice of any election proposed to be made by the Company under the
Indenture, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel regarding any
such election. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts not to cause
or permit a Default (as such term is defined in the Indenture) or Event of
Default (as such term is defined in the Indenture) to occur prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel with (i) any written communications that the Company or its
counsel may receive from any holder of the Convertible Notes, the Trustee or
any depository promptly after receipt of those communications, and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate with the Company or its counsel in any
material discussions or meetings with any holder of the Convertible Notes,

 Section 9.08 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits to this Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Company Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement, the statements in the body of this Agreement will control. 

  

 Section 9.09 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and respective successors and, except as provided in Section 6.08 hereof (which shall be to the benefit of the parties referred to in such section), nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have the right to pursue damages on behalf of its shareholders in the event of Parents or Merger Subs breach or wrongful termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding sentence to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the financing sources, including the financial institutions party to the Commitment Letter, shall be express third-party beneficiaries of Section 9.05(b) and Section 9.06. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.08 without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

  

 Section 9.10 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination 

   that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

 Section 9.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any attempt at assignment not in compliance with this Section 9.11 shall be null and void and without legal effect. 

  

 Section 9.12 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at Law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. 

  

 Section 9.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania or any Pennsylvania state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. None of the parties shall oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief sought in accordance with this Section 9.13 on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions in accordance with this Agreement to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction or order. 

  

 Section 9.14 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which will be one and the same agreement. This Agreement will become effective when each party to this Agreement will have received counterparts signed by all of the other parties.

 (e) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (without giving effect to any materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications therein), other than the representations and warranties in Section 4.02 (Capital Structure) or Section 4.20 (Information in the Offer Documents and
the Schedule 14D-9), shall not be true and correct, as of the Offer Closing

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions, and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Condition). The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
