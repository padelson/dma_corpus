permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement, waiver) of the conditions set
forth in _Article_ __ _ 6_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement, waiver of those
conditions) or at such other time or on such other date as may be mutually
agreed upon by the Parties (the date on which the Closing actually occurs, the
"Closing Date"). All transactions which are to take place at Closing shall be
considered to have taken place simultaneously, and no delivery or payment
shall be considered to have been made until all the transactions have been
completed. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing the Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Illinois in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Illinois Law (the time of such filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State
of the State of Illinois shall be referred to herein as the "Effective
Time").

(b) _Payment of Preliminary Purchase Price_. At the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall pay the Preliminary Purchase Price, by wire transfer or delivery of
other immediately available United States funds and in accordance with payment
delivery or wire instructions delivered by Lattner to Purchaser not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, as follows:

fully pay-off and discharge the Companies Indebtedness described in the
Payoff Letter delivered by Lattner to Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.7_ in accordance with the terms of the Payoff Letter;

(ii) Purchaser shall pay, on behalf of the Companies, any unpaid Transaction
Expenses to the applicable payees;

 

(iii) Purchaser shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent; and

 

(iv) Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Seller an amount equal
to (A) the Preliminary Purchase Price multiplied by (B) the Pro Rata Share
set forth opposite such Sellers name on the Disbursement Schedule (each such
amount, a "Unit Distribution Amount").

 

(c) _Deliveries at Closing_. At Closing, (i) Lattner shall deliver the various
certificates, documents or items referred to in this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_, and (ii) Purchaser shall deliver the various
certificates, instruments, documents or items, and the payments referred to in
this Agreement, including  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_.

1.5 Tax Treatment of the Merger; Allocation. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes,
the Merger shall be treated as a transaction described in Situation 2 of
Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432.

 



5  Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide the
Representative with a schedule allocating the aggregate consideration paid
pursuant to this Agreement (as adjusted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement), together with all other capitalized costs, among the Purchased
Assets (the "Allocation"). The Allocation shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Within fifteen (15) days of the Representatives receipt of the
Allocation, the Representative shall respond to the Allocation in writing,
noting with specificity any allocations with which the
Representative disagrees, and Purchaser and the Representative shall
negotiate in good faith for a period of fifteen (15) days to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the Allocation. In the event the Parties cannot
agree on the Allocation within such fifteen (15) day period, the dispute
shall be resolved by the Auditor. The Parties further acknowledge and agree
that any subsequent payments that may be made to the Sellers pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement will have the effect of increasing the amount that
will be allocated among the Purchased Assets and that such increase will be
taken into account in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth above.
Purchaser, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax
Returns (including any IRS Form 8594) consistent with the final Allocation and
shall take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith (including
in any audits or examinations by any Authority or any other proceeding
relating to Taxes), unless otherwise required by applicable Law or unless the
other Party consents thereto in writing, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall prevent Purchaser, the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither Purchaser
nor the Sellers (or their respective Affiliates) shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Authority challenging such Allocation. In addition, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent more likely than not deductible in such period for U.S.
Federal Income Tax purposes, the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

1.6 Tax Withholding. Each of Purchaser, the Surviving Company and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price and
other amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld under the Code, or any provision of
applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment; provided, however,
that neither Purchaser, the Surviving Company nor the Escrow Agent shall
withhold any Tax pursuant to Sections 1445 or 1446 of the Code from any Seller
that has delivered a statement conforming to the requirements set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(m)_. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to the applicable Taxing Authority, such payments shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such amounts were deducted or withheld.

ARTICLE 2.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF THE COMPANIES

Subject to the disclosures, matters and information set forth in the
disclosure schedules attached to this Agreement (each a "Schedule" and
collectively, the "Disclosure Schedules"), the Companies, jointly and
severally, represent and warrant to Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date:

 



6 2.1 Capitalization.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Units consist of 1,054 Units,
consisting of 975 Class A Units and 79 Class B Units. The rights and
privileges of the Units are set forth in the Lattners operating agreement and
Articles of Formation, as amended. No Units are held by Lattner as treasury
unit or are held by any subsidiary of Lattner. The Sellers listed on
the Disbursement Schedule own, of record and beneficially, all of the issued
and outstanding Units, and such Units represent the only outstanding
securities of Lattner. All of such issued and outstanding Units are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and such Units have
not been issued in violation of any preemptive rights or applicable Law. A
true, correct and complete list of record holders of the issued and
outstanding Units as of the date of this Agreement is set forth in _Schedule
2.1(a)_. Neither Lattner nor Rock Solid has any subsidiaries or owns any
capital stock or other equity interests in any Person, including joint
ventures, minority interests and publicly traded securities, except that as of
the Closing, Lattner shall own, of record and beneficially, all of the issued
and outstanding securities of Rock Solid.

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.1(a)_ , there is no existing option,
restricted unit, unit appreciation right, performance unit, "phantom" unit,
warrant, call, right or contract to which either Company is a party requiring,
and there are no securities of the Company outstanding which upon conversion
or exchange would require, the issuance, sale or transfer of any additional
Units or other equity securities of the Companies or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable or evidencing the right to subscribe for or
purchase Units or other equity securities of the Companies. Neither Company is
a party to any unitholder agreement, investors rights agreement, voting

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PURCHASER AND MERGER SUB

 

Purchaser and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
Lattner that the statements contained in this _Article 3_ are true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date:

3.1 Organization and Good Standing. Purchaser is a corporation duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Nevada.
Merger Sub is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Illinois.

 

3.2 Authority and Enforceability. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub has full
power and authority, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and any
Ancillary Document delivered or to be delivered pursuant to the Transaction,

Ancillary Document by each of Purchaser and Merger Sub, has been
duly authorized by all necessary action on its part. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by each of Purchaser and Merger Sub and (assuming
due execution and delivery by the Companies and Representative) constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of it, enforceable in accordance
with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Except for filing
the Certificate of Merger and providing notice of the Transaction to the IGB
and pursuant to the HSR Act, Purchaser is not required to give any notice to,
make any filing with or obtain any authorization, consent or approval of any
Authority or Person in order for Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the
Transaction.

 

3.3 Noncontravention. The Transaction will not: (a) violate any Law or other
restriction of any Authority to which each of Purchaser or Merger Sub is
subject; (b) violate any provision of each of Purchaser or Merger Subs

resolution adopted by the directors, managers or members of each of Purchaser
or Merger Sub; or (c) in any material respect, conflict with, result in a

portions of the Disclosure Schedules) are the only representations and
warranties made by the Companies; and (b) none of the Companies, any Seller
Party or any other Person has made any representation or warranty as to the
Companies, the Business, the Purchased Assets or this Agreement, except as
expressly set forth in _Article 2_ of this Agreement (including the related

(a) The Parties will each use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate
with each other: (i) to make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any

required under the HSR Act; provided that the Parties shall cooperate with

within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and will
cooperate with the other Party regarding any filings required of the Parties
or their Affiliates pursuant to the HSR Act and any other comparable
premerger filing statutes, if applicable, in any other jurisdiction that may
be necessary, proper or advisable in order to consummate the Transaction,
which filings shall include a request for early termination of any waiting
period, if available. In the event, after filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act, the Parties receive a Second Request in
connection with the Transactions the Parties shall comply with such Second
Request as provided by Section 7A(e) of the HSR Act expeditiously. If the
Parties receive a subpoena or civil investigative demand requesting materials
and information similar to that usually demanded in a Second Request, the
Parties shall comply with such subpoena or civil investigative demand
expeditiously. If the Authority disputes the adequacy of compliance by
Purchaser with respect to a Second Request, subpoena or civil investigative
demand, Purchaser shall endeavor to satisfy the Authority so as to minimize
any delay in the conduct or resolution of the investigation. Purchaser shall

23 4.4 Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Closing Date and the termination of the Agreement, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Lattner shall, and shall cause Rock Solid to,
furnish to Purchaser all documents, records and information concerning the
Companies, the affairs of the Business and the Purchased Assets as Purchaser
may reasonably request and provide access to the Companies premises,
personnel, representatives (including accountants and counsel) and properties
(including books and records) as Purchaser may reasonably request, provided,
that Lattner may withhold information to the extent required under any
confidentiality obligation owed to a third party on the date hereof in the
event that the Companies are unable to obtain the consent of the third party
to disclose such information to Purchaser (in which case, Lattner shall notify
Purchaser in writing that it is unable to deliver certain information due to
confidentiality requirements and generally identify such information to
Purchaser). 

4.5 Supplements to Schedules; Notice of Developments. If necessary, on a
periodic basis, Lattner shall supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule and
deliver it to Purchaser, with respect to any matter that is or would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule or that is
necessary to correct any information in the Disclosure Schedule which has
been rendered inaccurate thereby promptly following discovery thereof,
provided that (i) the matter or circumstance underlying such change was not in
existence prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) neither of the
Companies had any knowledge of such matter or circumstance prior to the date
of this Agreement (each, a "Schedule Update"). If any such Schedule Update
would result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.1(a)_ to be satisfied and Purchaser would as a result have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ and Purchaser
does not elect to so terminate this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt of such Schedule Update, the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
have been supplemented or amended as of the date hereof with respect to the
matters contained in such Schedule Update. If any such Schedule Update does
not provide Purchaser with the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, no such Schedule Update shall (i) be effective or
constitute an exception to the representations and warranties of the Companies
or limit in any way Purchasers rights or remedies in respect of any breach
of such representations and warranties, (ii) have any effect for purposes of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ or (iii)

Affiliates, members, directors, officers, Employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or agents
(collectively, "Representatives") retained by, or acting with the authority of
the Companies not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), induce, endorse or enter into
any agreement with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may be reasonably
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. If Lattner or any of its
Representatives receives an unsolicited written inquiry or offer, or is
approached in any manner by a Person, relating to an Acquisition Proposal, it
will promptly and in any event within 24 hours, notify Purchaser of the same
and provide to Purchaser a copy of any written inquiry or offer and all
correspondence related thereto; provided that neither Lattner nor its
Representatives shall have any obligation to disclose the details of any
Acquisition Proposal (or provide any related documents or correspondence) if
such action would cause Lattner or any of its Representatives to breach any
confidentiality or similar agreement in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

payoff letter reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser from each holder of the

or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document delivered or to be delivered pursuant to the Transaction, each of the
Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery
of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably
may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party with
respect to reasonable out of pocket costs (unless the requesting Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article_ __ _ 7_). Sellers and

Representative and Purchaser shall cooperate fully with each other after
Closing so that each Party has access to the business records, contracts and
other information existing as of Closing and relating in any manner to the
Purchased Assets or the conduct of the Business (whether in the possession
of Sellers, the Companies, Representative or Purchaser). No files, books or
records existing as of Closing and relating in any manner to the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the conduct of the Business shall be
destroyed by any Party in a manner inconsistent with such Partys record
retention policies or practices, after the Closing Date without giving the
other Parties at least 30 days prior written notice, during which time such
other Parties shall have the right (subject to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 5.2(b)_) to examine any such files, books and records prior to their
destruction in accordance with and under the terms of an appropriate and
customary nondisclosure undertaking by the examining Party. The Parties agree
that upon reasonable request of the other Parties such Party shall provide a
copy or summary of such Partys record retention policy or practices.
Purchaser, the Representative and the Sellers shall provide each other with
such assistance as may reasonably be required in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return and the conduct of any audit or other
examination by any taxing Authority or in connection with judicial or
administrative proceedings relating to any Liability for Taxes; provided,
however, that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, Purchaser
shall not be required to disclose to the Representative or the Sellers any
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which includes
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any information or materials related
thereto.

 



25 (b) The access to files, books and records contemplated by  _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ shall be during normal business hours and upon not less than two (2)
days prior written request, shall be subject to such reasonable limitations
as the party having custody or control thereof may impose to preserve the
confidentiality of information contained therein as contemplated in _Section_
__ _ 9.1_, and shall not extend to material subject to a claim of privilege
unless expressly waived by the party entitled to claim the same. The Parties
agree that upon the reasonable request of a Party, the other Party shall, in a
timely manner, provide copies of all such files, books and records
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_, the cost to be borne by the
requesting Party.

5.3 Employee Matters.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Lattner shall have delivered to Purchaser evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that each employment (or similar)
agreement of any Employee identified by Purchaser at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Identified Employees") with either of the
Companies has been terminated and is of no further force or effect as of the
Closing. The Companies will provide to all such terminated Employees a final
paycheck in accordance with their normal payroll practices and applicable Law.
All accrued benefits, vacations, or wages owing to all Employees up until
11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on the day prior to the Closing Date, and all
Liabilities associated with the termination of the Identified Employees or
their employment (or similar) agreements (including any severance or other
payment that is triggered by such termination or the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions, which shall constitute Transaction
Expenses), shall be Liabilities of the Companies and shall be paid by the
Companies prior to or simultaneously with the Closing.

 

(b) At any time prior to the Closing, Purchaser will have the right, but not
the obligation, to interview or otherwise meet and/or have discussions with
the Employees during normal business hours and as otherwise requested by
Purchaser. In connection therewith, the Companies will reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser to facilitate any such interviews, meetings or
discussions. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, offer employment to such number of
Employees so as not to trigger any notification requirements under the Worker
Adjustment Retraining Notification Act, as amended (the "WARN Act") or any
comparable state law applicable to such Employees. Purchaser or Purchasers
Affiliate will pay all benefits, vacation/sick pay and wages accruing from and
after 12:01 a.m. (Central Time) on the Closing Date for all Employees.

(c) Purchaser shall be responsible for complying with the WARN Act or any
similar Law or any and all Liabilities, resulting from Purchasers actions on
or after the Closing Date, for failure to comply with the WARN Act or any
similar Law.

arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code ("Company DC Plans"). Lattner
shall provide Purchaser with evidence that each Company DC Plan has been
terminated effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date pursuant
to resolutions duly adopted by the board of managers of the Companies or such
other applicable governing body or committee thereof.

 



26 (e) During the period from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall have access to, and the right to engage in discussions and conduct
meetings with, the Employees regarding the terms of potential post-Closing
employment or engagement of such Employees, provided that such discussions and
meetings are not reasonably expected to materially interfere with the
Employees work performance for Lattner. Within 7 days of the date of this
Agreement, Lattner shall provide Purchaser with access to all required
compensation and benefits information that is reasonably necessary for, or
reasonably requested by, Purchaser to provide medical, dental, vision and any
other applicable health and welfare benefits and 401(k) plan participation to
any continuing Employees.

receiving such statement from Purchaser, Representative may deliver a notice
to Purchaser disputing any calculation in the Closing Statement. Each of
Purchaser and Representative agrees to cooperate in good faith to resolve any
such dispute, and if, after ten (10) days of good faith negotiation, the
Parties are unable to resolve such dispute then the dispute shall be finally
resolved by the Auditor. The cost of such accounting firm shall be split
evenly between Purchaser and Representative.

(c) To the extent Sellers owe to Purchaser a sum of money based on the Final
Sellers Allocable Liabilities exceeding the Estimated Sellers Allocable
Liabilities, such amount shall be paid from the Escrow Amount to Purchaser
within five (5) Business Days after final determination of the Final Sellers
Allocable Liabilities, and to the extent Purchaser owes to Sellers a sum of
money based on the Final Sellers Allocable Liabilities being less than the
Estimated Sellers Allocable Liabilities, Purchaser shall pay such amount to

within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Sellers
Allocable Liabilities. To the extent Sellers owe to Purchaser a sum of money
based on the Final Companies Indebtedness exceeding the Estimated Companies
Indebtedness, such amount shall be paid from the Escrow Amount to Purchaser

Companies Indebtedness, and to the extent Purchaser owes to Sellers a sum of
money based on the Final Companies Indebtedness being less than the

Purchaser evidence of the same as soon as possible after the Closing (and
in any event within ten Business Days after the Closing Date).

5.7 Restrictive Covenants.

 

(a) The Restricted Parties agreement to be bound by the restrictive covenants
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ is in partial consideration of
Purchasers payment of the Purchase Price to the Restricted Parties and the
consummation of the Transaction. The Restricted Parties acknowledge that the
restrictive covenants set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are necessary,
fundamental and required for the protection of Purchaser, the Companies
(including the Surviving Entity) and the goodwill of the Business and
Purchased Assets and relate to matters which are of a special, unique and
extraordinary character that gives each of the restrictive covenants a
special, unique and extraordinary value. The Restricted Parties also
acknowledge that a breach of any of the restrictive covenants set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ may result in irreparable harm and damage to
Purchaser and the Surviving Entity. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or
threat of a breach of any provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ by
the Restricted Parties, Purchasers and the Surviving Entitys remedies at
law against the Restricted Parties may be inadequate and, in each such event,
Purchaser and the Surviving Entity will be entitled to seek an injunction or
other similar relief to prevent any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ by
the Restricted Parties and to enforce specifically the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ against the Restricted Parties, in addition to
money damages sustained by Purchaser and the Surviving Entity resulting from
the Restricted Parties breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, and in addition
to any other remedy to which Purchaser or the Surviving Entity may be
entitled at law or in equity. The duration of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall be extended by a period of time equal to the
number of days, if any, during which any Seller, successor thereof or any of
their Affiliates is in breach hereof. During the Restrictive Period, Sellers,
their Affiliates and their agents (collectively, the "Restricted Parties")
shall not, directly or indirectly: 

(i) Engage in, participate, sponsor, invest in or be employed or engaged by
any Person engaged in, competition with any aspect of the Business, including
activities related or ancillary thereto and reasonable extensions thereof,
within the State of Illinois or own or acquire an interest or an option to
acquire such interest in any Person engaged in competition with the Business
within the State of Illinois;

(ii) Solicit, induce, employ, retain as a consultant, interfere with or
attempt to entice, any contractor, vendor, service provider, strategic
partner or actual or prospective customer of the Business or Employees
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") away from Purchaser or the Surviving
Entity or to terminate such status or advise any Person against entering into
such status except, solely in the case of Employees, pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such Employees;
provided, that nothing in this clause (A) shall prevent the Restricted
Parties or any of their Affiliates from hiring any Employee whose employment
has been terminated by Purchaser or the Surviving Entity or (B) after 180 days
from the date of termination of employment, any Employee whose employment
has been terminated by the Employee;

 



29 (iii) Hire or attempt to hire, or solicit business from or provide services
to, any Person who was a Covered Person within the twelve (12) months
preceding the date thereof;

(iv) Otherwise intentionally disrupt or interfere with, or attempt to disrupt
or interfere with, the relations of the Purchaser or the Surviving Entity or
any of their Affiliates with any Covered Person; or

 

(v) Disparage or make any false or inaccurate statements to any media source,
industry member-company or group, financial institution or Covered Person
regarding the Purchaser or the Surviving Entity or their Affiliates.

(b) If any provision or portion thereof contained in  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_
is expressly determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such determination shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or
covenants, or rights or remedies, which shall be given full effect without
regard to the invalid portion or portions. If the courts of any one or more
jurisdictions shall hold all or any part of such provisions wholly
unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the
intention of the Parties that such determination shall not bar or in any way
affect Purchasers and the Surviving Entitys right to relief in the court of
any other jurisdiction as to failures to observe such provisions in such other
jurisdictions, the above provisions as they relate to each jurisdiction,
being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent provisions. If
any of the provisions contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ are held to be
unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered
thereby, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have
the power to reduce the duration or area of such provision and in its reduced
form said provision shall then be enforceable.

5.8 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. The
Party required by applicable Law shall, at its own expense, timely file any
Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and the other
Parties shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

 

5.9 Pass-Through Tax Returns. The Representative shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, all Pass-Through Tax Returns, regardless of
when such Pass-Through Tax Returns are due. The Representative shall permit
Purchaser to review and comment on each such Pass-Through Tax Return prior to
filing such Pass-Through Tax Return and shall consider in good faith
any revisions to such Pass-Through Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by
Purchaser that relate to an item or position on, or omitted from, a Pass-
Through Tax Return that could have the effect of increasing the Tax liability
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies after the
Closing Date) for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date or for which any of them might have any liability for Taxes not
fully indemnified pursuant to _Article 7_.

Seller shall, in accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata Share, indemnify and
defend and hold Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and their
Affiliates and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against the following and against any and all
Adverse Consequences arising out of, resulting from, relating to, in the
nature of or caused by:

(i) Any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Companies in
this Agreement.

(ii) Any breach of any covenant made by the Companies in this Agreement;

(vi) Any amounts payable pursuant to adjustments contemplated by _Section_ __
_ 1.3(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_; and

(vii) any Companies Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses unpaid as at the
Closing, in each case that are not taken into account in the calculation of
the Purchase Price.

For the avoidance of doubt, no items included in  _Section_ __ _
7.1(a)(i)-(vii)_ shall be double counted for purposes of calculating the
amount of Adverse Consequences or Sellers indemnity obligations under this
Agreement. In addition, none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover for Adverse Consequences pursuant to this _Article 7_ to
the extent that the amount of any Adverse Consequences was taken into account
pursuant to the adjustments contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_, or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of
Purchase Price.

 



33 (b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article 7_ , Purchaser
shall indemnify and defend Sellers and their Affiliates and agents
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against the

Sub in this Agreement; and

 

(ii) Any breach of any covenant made by Purchaser or Merger Sub in this
Agreement.

 

7.2 Indemnification Procedures and Limitations.

 

(a) _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, all representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Document delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement
or pursuant to the Transaction shall survive Closing for 15 months, except
that the Fundamental Representations shall survive for any applicable statute
of limitations plus ninety (90) days. Any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement shall survive Closing in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) _Notice_. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of
a claim for indemnification under this Agreement (a "Claim"), a Party seeking
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ (an "Indemnified Party") shall
give written notice of such Claim (a "Claim Notice") to the Party from whom
such indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), but failure to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
hereunder (except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered
actual prejudice thereby). Any Claim against an Indemnified Party by a third
party (who is not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a Party to this
Agreement), whether or not involving a proceeding, is referred to in this
Agreement as a "Third Party Claim", and any other Claim against an
Indemnified Party which does not result from a Third Party Claim is referred
to in this Agreement as a "Direct Claim". Any survival period time limitation
specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ shall not apply to a Claim which has
been the subject of notice from the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party given in good faith prior to the expiration of such period. The Claim
Notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the existence, the specific
facts and circumstances, and (to the extent alleged or otherwise
determinable) the amount of any such Third Party Claim.

(c) _Third Party Claims_.

(i) An Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (A) the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party, in writing within forty-five (45) days after
the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim, that the
Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party
Claim, and (B) the Third Party Claim does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief and involves predominantly monetary damages which, if
the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, would not reasonably
be expected to exceed the Escrow Amount.

 



34 (ii) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)(i)_, (A) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld or delayed
unreasonably) and (C) with respect to a Third Party claim involving the IGB
or any settlement involving any remedy other than the payment of monetary
damages, the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld or
delayed unreasonably); provided, however, in the event that the Indemnified
Party fails to grant such written consent and the Third Party has agreed to
settle the Third Party Claim in the amount proposed by the Indemnifying Party
(the "Proposed Settlement Amount"), the aggregate Liability of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim shall in no event
exceed the Proposed Settlement Amount.

(iii) In the event any of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)(i)_ is or becomes unsatisfied:

(A) the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim; and

(B) (x) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld or delayed
unreasonably), (y) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party
promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and (z) the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Adverse Consequences the
Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to,
in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim.

(iv) In the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim, the Parties
shall cooperate with one another (and with each others counsel) in all
commercially reasonable respects, including furnishing any documentation or
other information reasonably requested by a Party or such Partys counsel that
is within the other Partys or such other Partys counsels possession or
control.

(d) _Direct Claims_. Except for  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ which applies only
to Third Party Claims, all provisions of this _Article 7_ shall apply to
Direct Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall satisfy any Direct Claim within
forty-five (45) days after receipt of notice of such Direct Claim pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_. If the Direct Claim is not satisfied by the
Indemnifying Party within such 15-day period, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to pursue any or all remedies as may be available to the Indemnified
Party under this _Article 7_ or otherwise.

(e)  _Limitations_.

(i) _Threshold_. An Indemnified Party may not make a Claim for indemnification
under  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(i)_, as
applicable, until the aggregate amount of all Adverse Consequences in respect
of such Claims exceeds $300,000.00 (the "Basket"), and in such event, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for all Adverse
Consequences in excess of the amount of the Basket; provided, however, the
Basket shall not apply to Claims under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ arising out of or
relating to any breach of a Fundamental Representation.

 



35 (ii) _Indemnification Cap_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iv)_ and other
than claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the maximum aggregate
amount that the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser on the other hand,
shall, as Indemnifying Parties be required to pay to an Indemnified Party
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, shall not exceed an amount equal to
$6,500,000 (the "Indemnity Cap"); provided, however, the Indemnity Cap shall
not apply to Claims under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ arising out of or relating to
any breach of a Fundamental Representation.

(iii) _Maximum Aggregate Liability_. Other than claims for fraud
or intentional misrepresentation, with respect to all claims made by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to any breach of a
Fundamental Representation, the maximum aggregate amount that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover with respect to all such
claims collectively shall not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

(iv) _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Fund shall be the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties primary source of recovery for any indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, and shall be the Purchaser Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive
remedy for claims pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)(i)_. To the extent that
the Escrow Fund has been exhausted or is unavailable, subject to the other
limitations contained in this Agreement (including this _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)_), any Adverse Consequences payable to a Purchaser Indemnified Party
by a Seller pursuant to _Sections 7.1(a)(ii) through (vii)_ shall be paid by
such Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party. Upon the
termination of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the Escrow Account to
Representative (for the account of, and further distribution, the Sellers) on
the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

(f) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party recovers Adverse
Consequences in respect of a Claim under this Agreement, no other Indemnified
Party, as applicable, may recover the same Adverse Consequences in respect of
a Claim under this Agreement.

 

(g) _Offsets_. All Adverse Consequences for which any Indemnified Party would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this  _Article 7_ shall be
reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and
other third-party recoveries that the Indemnified Party has actually received
in respect of any Adverse Consequences incurred by such Indemnified Party,
net of reasonable costs of collecting same (including increases in premiums);
and each applicable Indemnified Party shall have an obligation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds,
payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are realized by an
Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any
indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries relate,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant Indemnified Party
of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification payment.

  



36 (h) _Mitigation of Adverse Consequences_. An Indemnified Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Adverse Consequences upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_.

(i) _Materiality Disregarded_. For purposes of Claims pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 7.1(a)(i)_, any references to a "Material Adverse Effect" or "material"
limitations, while being taken into account for purposes of determining
whether a Claim by Purchaser for Adverse Consequences exists, shall be
disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount of said Claim.

7.3 Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Indemnification pursuant to
this _Article 7_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties and any
third parties claiming by or through any Party for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
(other than any breach of any covenant in this Agreement that, by its terms,
provides for performance following the Closing or other than claims arising
from fraud or intentional misrepresentation, on the part of a Party in
connection with the Transaction), and the Parties shall not be entitled to
rescission of this Agreement or to any further contract, tort or

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Confidentiality. All information, materials, data and documents in all
forms (whether written or otherwise) relating to the Transaction, Business,
Purchased Assets, any Party, or the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents (collectively, the "Confidential Information") shall
be treated and held as confidential by any Party receiving Confidential
Information ("Receiving Party") from a Party revealing Confidential
Information ("Disclosing Party"). The Receiving Party shall refrain from
using any such Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose not
in connection with the Transaction or in any manner or for any purpose
detrimental to the Business or the Purchased Assets or the Disclosing Partys
interest, and shall upon the failure to consummate the Transaction, deliver
promptly to the Disclosing Party or destroy, at the request and option of the
Disclosing Party, all tangible embodiments or electronic forms of such
Confidential Information which are in its possession. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, only representatives of the Receiving Party who have a
commercially reasonable need to know may receive or have access to
Confidential Information, and then only if all necessary and appropriate
measures are taken to protect such Confidential Information. The Receiving
Party shall also take all necessary and appropriate measures to assure that
its representatives who receive or have access to Confidential Information of
the Disclosing Party observe and comply with the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 9.1_. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required
(by oral question or request for information for documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatories, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall

 



38  notify the Disclosing Party promptly of the request or requirement so that
the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver under this _Section_
__ _ 9.1_, the Receiving Party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any Authority or else stand liable
for contempt, the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information to
the Authority; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of the Disclosing
Party, an order or such assurance that confidential treatment be accorded to
such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the
Disclosing Party shall designate. The foregoing provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 9.1_ notwithstanding, (a) after the Closing the restrictions imposed on
Confidential Information regarding the Purchased Assets shall not apply to
Purchaser or its Affiliates, (b) the Parties acknowledge and agree that this
Agreement will be submitted to the IGB for review and each Party consents to
the disclosure of this Agreement (and any Confidential Information requested
by the IGB in connection with its review of this Agreement) to the IGB,
and (c) the Parties acknowledge and agree that Purchaser or its Affiliates
may disclose Confidential Information (including by publicly filing this
Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission) to the extent required
by applicable Law or regulation (including, without limitation, any rule,
regulation or policy statement of NYSE or any other listing authority, stock
exchange or other such body) or order of any court or other Authority.

 

9.2 Publicity. Prior to the Closing, no publicity release, announcement or
other disclosure to Persons other than the Parties or their respective
representatives shall be issued by any Party (or its/their agents or
Affiliates) without prior consent to the form and substance thereof by
Purchaser (in the case of any proposed release or announcement by Sellers, the
Companies or Representative or their agents or Affiliates) or Lattner (in the
case of any proposed release, announcement or other disclosure by Purchaser or
its agents or Affiliates). In the event any such publicity release
announcement is required by Law to be made by the Party proposing to issue
the same, such Party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in good faith
with the other Party prior to the issuance of any such publicity release or
announcement.

 

9.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, the Companies, Sellers and Representative shall pay all costs and
expenses incurred or to be incurred by Sellers and Representative in
connection with the terms of this Agreement or the Transaction, including all
Transaction Expenses, attorneys fees, accountants fees, the broker fee to
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and related costs and expenses. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, Purchaser
shall pay all costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by Purchaser and
Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction, including
all attorneys fees, accountants fees and related costs and expenses.

9.4 Costs. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, if any legal action or any arbitration or other proceeding is
commenced for the enforcement of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, or
in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, prevailing Party or Parties shall be entitled to recover attorneys
fees and other costs incurred in such action, arbitration or proceeding, in
addition to any other relief to which it or they may be entitled.

 



39 9.5 Other Prospective Purchasers. Purchaser shall not incur any Liability in
connection with the Transaction to any other Person with whom the Companies,
Sellers, or their brokers, agents or representatives, have had negotiations or
discussions regarding any potential merger, sale or exchange of ownership,
equity or capital interest or other business combination involving the
Companies or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner a substantial
equity interest in the Companies or all or a substantial portion of the assets
of the Companies, including any of the Purchased Assets.

9.6 Specific Performance.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
the Companies, Sellers or Representative, on the one hand, or Purchaser or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Companies, Sellers and
Representative, on the one hand, and Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy
of legal remedy and without bond or other security being required. The
pursuit of specific enforcement by any Party will not be deemed an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether
at law or in equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time.

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.

 

(c) The Companies, Sellers and Representative, on the one hand, and Purchaser
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections
to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Companies, Sellers and Representative, on the
one hand, or Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the other hand, as applicable, under
this Agreement. The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, a Party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be
available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, nor shall the commencement of
any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ or anything set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ restrict or limit any Partys right to
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

9.7 Notices. All notices, Claims, consents, requests, instructions,
approvals, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in
writing and deemed duly given, if delivered: (a) personally by hand or by a
nationally recognized overnight courier service, when delivered at the address
specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_; (b) by United States certified or
registered first class mail when delivered at the address specified in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.7_,

 



40  on the date appearing on the return receipt therefor; or (c) by electronic
mail when such electronic mail is transmitted to the electronic mail address
specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_. In the event that a Party is unable
to deliver a notice, claim, consent, request, instruction, approval, demand,
or other communication due to the inaccuracy of the address or electronic mail
address provided by the other Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, or
the other Partys failure to notify the Party of a change of its address or
electronic mail address as specified pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_,
such notice, claim, consent, request, instruction, approval, demand, or other
communication shall be deemed to be effective upon confirmation by a
nationally recognized overnight courier service of its failure to complete
delivery to the other Partys address as set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.7_ (or other address duly given to the Party by the other Party in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_).

provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver

9.9 Rights of Parties.

 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to
confer any benefit, right or remedy under or by reason of this Agreement on
any Persons other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, nor is anything in this Agreement intended to relieve or
discharge the obligation or Liability of any other Person to any Party, nor
shall any provision give any other Person any right of subrogation or action
over or against any Party.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, including in  _Article 7_ , in any way
modifies or otherwise limits the rights or remedies available to any of the

matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules. Such
additional information is set forth for informational purposes and does not
