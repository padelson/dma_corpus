notice to Champion, elect to remove any Executory Contract, Real Property
Lease or Other Contract from _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , and, unless later re-

such Executory Contract or Real Property Lease shall be a Non-  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Assumed Contract and all Liabilities thereunder shall,
except to the extent otherwise expressly included among the
Assumed Liabilities, be Excluded Liabilities.

       | iii.  |   | At the Sale Hearing, the Sellers shall seek the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court to the assumption and assignment, effective
as of Closing, of all the Executory Contracts and Real Property Leases
listed on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ on the Contract Designation Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | iv.  |   | On or before February 13, 2010, the Sellers shall

    | v.  |   | Counterparties must serve any objection to the
assumption and/or assignment of any Executory Contract or Real Property Lease
that is an Assigned Contract by the date that is fifteen (15) days after
service of the Cure Notice or such other date approved by the Bankruptcy
Court in the Bidding Procedures Order.  
      
    | vi.  |   | The Purchaser may exclude from the Contract List and
_Schedule 1.1(a)_, by the date that is ten days after service of the
counterpartys objection and notification of such objection to
the Purchaser, any Executory Contract or Real Property Lease to which an
objection from a contract counterparty has been received. In addition, at any
time prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may exclude any Executory Contract
or Real Property Lease in the event that the cure amount submitted by the
Sellers in relation to such Contract is adjusted upward by the Bankruptcy
Court. If the cure amount is not finally determined by the Bankruptcy Court
prior to the Closing Date, the assumption and assignment of such Executory
Contract or Real Property Lease to the Purchaser shall be deferred until such
final determination is made, and (i) at Purchasers discretion, Sellers shall
continue to honor the Contract and make benefits available to
Purchaser, with all costs and obligations in connection therewith to
be borne by Purchaser until ten days following the later to occur of any
decision by the Purchaser to defer or exclude such Contract, and (ii) within
10 calendar days after the Bankruptcy Courts final determination, Purchaser
may exclude such Executory Contract or Real Property Lease from the Contract
List and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ if the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Bankruptcy Court adjusts upward the cure amount;
provided, however, Purchaser shall bear and be responsible for all costs and
obligations associated with such Executory Contract until the date which is
the first to occur of (ww) the assumption and assignment thereof by Sellers
to Purchaser, (xx) Sellers successfully rejecting the applicable
Contract in accordance with Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and (yy) 15
days following Purchasers written election to exclude such Contract and
treat it as a Non-Assumed Contract. Any Executory Contracts and Real Property
Leases excluded from _Schedule 1.1(a)_ pursuant to this _sub-clause (vi)_
shall be Non-Assumed Contracts, and all Liabilities thereunder shall, except
to the extent otherwise expressly included among the Assumed Liabilities, be
Excluded Liabilities. Purchasers right to exclude Contracts pursuant to
this sub-clause (vi) shall be its sole remedy to a counterparty objection to
assumption and assignment of an Executory Contract or adjustment of a cure
amount by the Bankruptcy Court.

       | vii.  |   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 1.7_, from the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to
the Contract Designation Date, if the Sellers identify any
Executory Contract, Real Property Lease or Other Contract entered into by
one or more Sellers prior to the Closing that was not previously provided to
the Purchaser, Champion shall provide a copy of such Executory Contract, Real
Property Lease or Other Contract to the Purchaser within two (2) Business
Days of such identification, along with whatever other information about
such Executory Contract, Real Property Lease or Other Contract that the
Purchaser reasonably requests. The Purchaser may include the
applicable Executory Contract, Real Property Lease or Other Contract on 
_Schedule 1.1(a)_ as an Assigned Contract at any time within five (5)
Business Days from receipt thereof, and, subject to following sentence
(including the right to exclude the Contract following receipt of objection
to assumption and assignment from the contract counterparty) and _sub-clause
(ix)_ , shall be an Assigned Contract for all purposes of this Agreement. To
the extent required under applicable law, Sellers shall, subject to
Purchasers obligation to bear and pay in accordance with
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ and out of the Wind-Down Facility all costs and
obligations in connection with such Contract until the first to occur of (ww)
the assumption and assignment thereof by Sellers to Purchaser, (xx) Sellers
successfully rejecting the applicable Contract in accordance with  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and (yy) 15 days
following Purchasers written election to exclude such Contract and treat it
as a Non-Assumed Contract, thereafter seek the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court to the assumption and assignment, effective as of the Closing, of such
Executory Contract or Real Property Lease, subject to the requirement to
deliver Cure Notices set forth in sub-clause (iv) above, the right of the
contract counterparties to object set forth in sub-clause (v) above and the
right of the Purchaser to exclude the applicable Contract or Contracts in
accordance with sub-clause (vi) above; _provided_ that the deadlines set
forth in each of sub-clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) shall run from the date that
Purchaser includes the applicable Executory Contract or Real Property Lease
on  _Schedule 1.1(a)_ as an Assigned Contract.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | viii.  |   | Subsequent to the Contract Designation Date
and except as set forth in this  _Section 1.7_, the Purchaser shall not have
the right to make or change any designation of Executory Contracts or Real
Property Leases without the prior written consent of Champion, which shall

Purchaser as Purchased Assets, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and at
any time prior to the Closing Date, exclude any such Contracts from the
Contract List and _Schedule 1.1(a)_. In addition, at any time prior to the

days following Purchasers written election to exclude such Contract and
treat it as a Non-Assumed Contract. Any Executory Contracts and Real Property

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser may (i) include in the definition of Purchased Assets and exclude from the definition of Excluded Assets, any Contract and any asset of a type described in _Sections 1.1(o) or 1.1(p)_ (so long as the Asset Purchaser also assumes, as applicable, the Liabilities underlying the applicable insurance policies acquired pursuant to _Section 1.1(o)_ or the Liabilities underlying the applicable assets acquired pursuant to _Section 1.1(p)_) of any Seller and (ii) exclude from the definition of Purchased Assets and include in the definition of Excluded Assets, any Contract or asset of a type described in _Section 1.1(o) or 1.1(p)_, in the case of Contracts in the manner set forth in _Section 1.7_ above and in the case of assets of a type described in  _Sections 1.1(o) or 1.1(p)_ on or prior to the Interim Deadline.

The Purchaser may also assume any other Liability of any Seller previously included in the Excluded Liabilities at any time on or prior to the Interim Deadline, by revising the applicable Schedules to this Agreement; _provided_ that no such change to the Schedules, the definition of the Excluded Liabilities or the definition of the Assumed Liabilities shall result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

      ##### 

  

    

the Purchaser and elected prior to Closing, the intercompany loan in the
amount of approximately $646,000 from SRI Homes ULC (Canada) to CHBC will be
left in place and the Purchaser will agree that from and after the Closing

In furtherance of the foregoing, unless otherwise determined or elected by the Purchaser as contemplated by clauses (a), (b) and (c) above: (i) the approximately $117.1 million of loans receivable that CHBC holds from CHB International will be transferred to the New Holdco at Closing as contemplated by _Section 1.2(b)_ ; the approximately $4.3 million loan owed by Moduline Industries ULC (Canada) to CHBC as well as the $4.0 million loan owed by Caledonian Building Systems Ltd (UK) to CHBC would be contributed by CHBC to the capital of CHB International prior to the sale of the stock of CHB International to the New Holdco

contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal of
the Sale Order, Sellers shall continue to use reasonable efforts to defend
such appeal,  _provided_ , _however_ , such undertaking shall be contingent
upon Purchasers agreement to reimburse Sellers, on terms and conditions

such efforts, in amounts to be mutually agreed by Champion and the
Purchaser.
