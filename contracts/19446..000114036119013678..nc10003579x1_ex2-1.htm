be released to the Seller pursuant to joint written instructions delivered by
the Purchaser and the Seller to the Escrow Agent and (ii) all of the Escrowed
Cash with  respect to the Adjustment Escrow Account (other than any amounts

(c) The parties hereto agree that, for Tax reporting  purposes, the Seller
shall be treated as the owner of the Escrowed Cash, and that all interest on
or other taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of the Escrowed
Cash pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as  earned
by the Seller until the Escrowed Cash is distributed in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The parties hereto agree that any and all
interest, gains and other distributions and income earned on the Escrow
Accounts  shall be solely for the account of the Seller (and all such amounts
shall be distributed to the Seller from the Escrow Accounts in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement).

shall  prepare and deliver to the Seller a statement setting forth (i) the
Working Capital of the Company Group as of the Adjustment Time (the " _Final

the Final Working Capital determination and/or all or a part of the Final Net
Indebtedness determination and/or all or a part of the Final Acquisition
Expenses,  specifying in reasonable detail those items that the Seller
disputes (an " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Seller does not provide an
Objection Notice with respect to the Final Working Capital determination
within such forty-five (45)-day  period, such amount shall be final and
binding on the parties. If the Seller does not provide an Objection Notice
with respect to the Final Net Indebtedness determination within such forty-
five (45)-day period, such amount shall be final and  binding on the parties.
If the Seller does not provide an Objection Notice with respect to the Final

be final and binding on the parties.

 


 

 

(c) If the Seller delivers an Objection Notice to the Purchaser, then the
Seller  and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
disputed items for thirty (30) days following the Purchaser's receipt of the
Objection Notice. If, during such period, the Seller and the Purchaser are
able to resolve such dispute  and agree on the amount of Working Capital as

Acquisition Expenses, such amount shall become final and binding on the
parties.

 


 

 

(d) If the Purchaser and the Seller do not agree on a final resolution with 
respect to any disputed items within such period, then the remaining items in

declines to act, another nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed
upon by  Purchaser and the Seller (the " _Independent Auditor_ "). The
parties agree to instruct the Independent Auditor to render a determination of
the applicable dispute within forty-five (45) days after referral of the
matter to such Independent  Auditor, which determination must be in writing
and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The Independent
Auditor shall be bound by this _Section 2.8(d)_ and shall determine only those
issues still in dispute, and the  Independent Auditor may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
the Purchaser or the Seller or less than the least value for such item claimed
by either the Purchaser or the Seller. The  Independent Auditor shall make
its determination (i) based solely on the documentation submitted by, and
presentations made by, the parties (any such documentation or presentation
must be provided to the other parties prior to its submission or 
presentation to the Independent Auditor) and (ii) in a manner consistent with
the Transaction Accounting Principles and Section 1.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and the definitions of Net Indebtedness, Working Capital and
Acquisition  Expenses (and each of the defined terms used in each of those
terms or in which those terms are used and the related provisions of this
Agreement). The determination of the Independent Auditor pursuant to this
Section 2.8(d) shall be final and  binding on the parties. The fees of the
Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Seller and the Purchaser in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent Auditor.

 

 

23  

(e) The final and binding amount of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness as
of  the Adjustment Time and the final and binding amount of Acquisition
Expenses, in each case, as finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.8, shall be the " _Actual Working Capital_ ," the " _Actual Net
Indebtedness_ " and the " _Actual     Acquisition Expenses_ ,"
respectively.

 


 

 

(f) The Seller and the Purchaser will, and will cause their respective 
accountants and Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist in resolving any
disputes under this Section 2.8, including by making available, to the extent
necessary, books, records, work papers and personnel, subject to Section 6.3.

 


 

 

(g) If the Actual Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital,  then promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
after the date on which such amount is finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.8), the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller
an amount in cash equal to  such excess, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Seller. If the
Actual Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, then
promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business  Days after the date on
which such amount is finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.8),
the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow  Account
an amount in cash equal to such shortfall in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

 


 

 

(h) If the Actual Net Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Net 
Indebtedness, then promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
after the date on which such amount is finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.8), the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver joint written
instructions to  the Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser from the

than the Estimated Net  Indebtedness, then promptly (but in any event within
three (3) Business Days after the date on which such amount is finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.8), the Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Seller an amount in  cash equal to such excess, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Seller.

 


 

 

(i) If the Actual Acquisition Expenses are greater than the Estimated
Acquisition  Expenses, then promptly (but in any event within three (3)
Business Days after the date on which such amount is finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.8), the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver
joint written instructions to the  Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser
from the Adjustment Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to such excess in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Actual Acquisition
Expenses are less than the Estimated Acquisition  Expenses, then promptly

amount is finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.8), the
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an amount in cash 
equal to such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Seller.

 

 

24  

(j) Any obligations of the Seller to make any payments to the Purchaser
pursuant  to Sections 2.8(g), (h) or (i) may be satisfied in whole or in part
by the release to the Purchaser of the applicable amount from the Adjustment
Escrow Account pursuant to joint written instructions delivered by the
Purchaser and the Seller to  the Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither party shall be obligated to make any
payment to the other party pursuant to this Section 2.8 (net of any payments
received by such party pursuant to this  Section 2.8) in an aggregate amount
in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 


 

 

(k) Promptly following completion of each of the payments (if any) pursuant
to  Sections 2.8(g), (h) and (i), the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release any remaining amount
in the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Seller.

 


 

 

Section 2.9 _ Withholding_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
Earnout Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted  and withheld
with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws. If Purchaser
determines that any deduction or withholding is required in respect of a
payment pursuant to this Agreement or the Earnout Agreement, Purchaser shall
provide  written notice to Seller no less than five (5) days prior to the
date on which such deduction or withholding is to be made, and the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to mitigate any such
requirement to the maximum  extent permitted by Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall
be (a) treated for all purposes of this Agreement or the Earnout Agreement, as
applicable, as having been paid to the Person  in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made and (b) paid over to the proper
Governmental Authority.

distribute the Consideration to the Owners in accordance with applicable Law

Letter (which Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter may be amended upon
written  agreement among the Owners and written notice to the Purchaser). The
Seller agrees that (a) the Closing Stock Consideration that does not
constitute Excess Shares shall not directly or indirectly be distributed or
otherwise transferred by the  Seller to any Person other than to Owners that
are Permitted Transferees and (b) any Closing Stock Consideration that
constitutes Excess Shares shall not directly or indirectly be distributed or
otherwise transferred by the Seller to any Person  (other than in accordance
with the Registration Rights Agreement) but shall instead be retained by the
Seller to be sold pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Following the
completion of any such sale, the Seller shall distribute to the  Owners the
proceeds in respect of such sale of such Excess Shares and any payment made to
the Seller pursuant to Section 2.11 in accordance with applicable Law and the
New Seller LLC Agreement and Section 2.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(which  Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter may be amended upon written
agreement among the Owners and written notice to the Purchaser).

 

 

25  

Section 2.11 _ Post-Closing Payment in Respect of Offering Proceeds_.

 


 

 

(a) If, following the Closing, a Post-Closing Offering is completed pursuant
to  the Registration Rights Agreement and the aggregate net proceeds received
by the Seller in the Post-Closing Offering (the " _Aggregate Post-Closing
Offering Proceeds_ ") are greater than the product of the Purchaser Share
Price _multiplied  by_ the number of Excess Shares sold in the Post-Closing
Offering (such product, the " _Excess Share Value_ "), then promptly (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) following the consummation of the
Post-Closing Offering, the  Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Purchaser, an amount in cash equal to the
Aggregate Post-Closing Offering Proceeds _minus_ the  Excess Share Value. If,
following the Closing, a Post-Closing Offering is completed pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Excess Share Value exceeds the Aggregate
Post-Closing Offering Proceeds, then promptly (and in any event  within five
(5) Business Days) following the consummation of the Post-Closing Offering,
the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Seller,  an amount in cash equal to the Excess Share Value _minus_ the
Aggregate Post-Closing Offering Proceeds.

 


 

 

(b) If the Post-Closing Offering is consummated on or prior to the first
year  anniversary of the Closing , then promptly (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days) following the consummation of the Post-Closing
Offering, Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount in cash equal to:

 


 

 

(i) if the Excess Capital Loss is not greater than zero, (A)  the Short-Term
Capital Gain _multiplied by_ fifty-two percent (52%) _multiplied by_ the
Incremental Capital Gains Rate, _divided by_ (B) an amount equal to one
_minus_ the Long-Term Capital Gains Rate; or

 


 

 

(ii) if the Excess Capital Loss is greater than zero: (A) the  Excess Capital
Loss _multiplied by_ fifty-two percent (52%) _multiplied by_ the Long-Term
Capital Gains Rate, _divided by_ (B) an amount equal to one _minus_ the Long-
Term Capital Gains Rate.

 


 

 

By way of example, Exhibit E sets forth certain illustrative calculations of
the payments required to be made pursuant to this  Section 2.11(b) and
certain inputs thereof.

 


 

 

(c) If (i) the Post-Closing Offering occurs in the taxable year following
the  taxable year which includes the Closing Date and (ii) Purchaser paid any
amount to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_ , then promptly following the
end of each taxable year in which any payment relevant to the definition of
"Other  Payments" is made, the amount set forth in the relevant subsection of
_Section 2.11(b)_ shall be recalculated. If such recalculation results in an
amount that is less than the amount previously paid by Purchaser pursuant to
_Section  2.11(b)_ (net of any amounts previously returned by Seller under
this _Section 2.11(c)_ ), Seller shall promptly return such excess to
Purchaser.

 

 

26  

Section 2.12 _ Adjustment_. In the event that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, any change in the outstanding Purchaser Shares
shall occur as a result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock 
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of Capital Stock convertible
into or exchangeable for Purchaser Shares), recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar event, the
Closing Stock Consideration  shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
event and to provide to holders of Seller and the Permitted Transferees the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

or  effective control" or (ii) "in the ownership of a substantial portion of

"disqualified individual"  or failing to be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code or subject to an excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of the occurrence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

purposes. No member of the Company Group has  any liability by reason of an
individual who performs or performed services in the United States for any
member of the Company Group in any capacity being improperly excluded from
participating in a Benefit Plan. Each Person who performs or  performed
services as an independent contractor outside of the United States has been
properly classified as a contractor under local law, except where any such
failure would not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to
any  member of the Company Group. Each employee of each member of the Company

requirement of any applicable  Laws in respect of employment and employment
practices and terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except

comply, individually or in the aggregate,  would not be material to the
Company Group, taken as a whole.

Code), in a distribution intended  to qualify under Section 355(a) of the
Code.

 


 

 

(i) Each member of the Company Group is resident for Tax purposes only in
the  jurisdiction in which it is incorporated. No member of the Company Group

(j) During the last five (5) years, no jurisdiction in which any member of

that would be reasonably expected to affect any member of the Company Group
after the Closing.

 


 

 

(l) No member of the Company Group has any requests (or is the subject of
any  requests) for rulings or special Tax incentives pending with any
Governmental Authority relating to Taxes. Each member of the Company Group is

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser has 
delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of an executed debt
commitment letter dated as of the date hereof and a corresponding fee letter
dated as of the date hereof (with only the fee amounts, interest rates and
other "flex"  terms redacted (none of which redacted provisions would be
reasonably expected to adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing (as defined below)) from the financial institution identified
therein (together with all exhibits,  annexes and schedules thereto,
collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ ") to provide, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, debt financing to the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ").     As of the
date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified and the
commitments contained in such Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. The Purchaser has fully paid or caused
to be  fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be

date hereof. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letter, the net  proceeds committed to be delivered pursuant to
the Commitment Letter, together with the Purchaser's and its Subsidiaries'
available and committed credit facilities and cash on hand, will provide all
the funds necessary for the Purchaser, on and  as of the Closing Date, to (a)
pay the amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i) and (ii) and (b) pay any
fees and expenses of or payable by the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date  hereof, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the parties thereto (other than
the Purchaser), the Commitment Letter is a valid and binding obligation of the
Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, each of the other  parties
thereto and is in full force and effect, in each case, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, (x) there is no default or
breach under the Commitment Letter by the Purchaser, or, to the knowledge of
the Purchaser,  any other parties thereto, and (y) no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach (I) on the part of the Purchaser or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, any other parties thereto,  under the Commitment Letter or (II) of
the types described under Sections 9.01(a), 9.01(f) (with respect to the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, other than Immaterial Subsidiaries) or 9.01(g)
(with respect to the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,  other than Immaterial
Subsidiaries) of the Purchaser Credit Agreement). As of the date hereof, the
Purchaser has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances or any reason to
believe that any facts or circumstances exist that, assuming the 
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 and
the occurrence of the Closing Date, would be reasonably likely to result in
any of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied
or the funding  contemplated in the Commitment Letter not being made
available on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is
not subject to any conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties
thereunder (including pursuant to any  flex provisions in the related fee
letter or otherwise) to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available
at the Closing, or any contingencies that would permit the parties thereto to
reduce the amount of the Financing, other than as  expressly set forth
therein. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters, arrangements or
other Contracts to which the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of 
the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter
(and the related fee letter).

 

 

49  

(b) The Purchaser has, and will continue to have through the Closing,
sufficient  authorized but unissued or treasury Purchaser Shares for the
Purchaser to meet its obligation to deliver the Closing Stock Consideration
under this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 5.7 _No Shareholder Approval_. The issuance and delivery by the
Purchaser of the Closing Stock Consideration to the Seller does not require
any vote  or other approval or authorization of any holder of any Capital
Stock of the Purchaser.

 


 

 

Section 5.8 _Brokers_. Except for Perella Weinberg Partners, L.P., whose fees
and expenses shall be borne solely by the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(other  than any member of the Company Group), no broker, finder or
investment banker is or shall be entitled to any brokerage, finder's,
financial advisor's or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions as a result of any action,  agreement, commitment or arrangement
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 

 

50  

Section 5.9 _Purchaser SEC Reports_.

 


 

 

(a) The Purchaser has filed with or furnished to the SEC (including following
any  extensions of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) all reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses,
registration statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished,
as the case may be,  by the Purchaser since December 31, 2016 (collectively,
together with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other information
incorporated therein, the " _Purchaser SEC Documents_ ").

 


 

 

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the  most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Purchaser SEC Document complied in all material respects with

any of its accounting  policies or practices are the subject of any review,
inquiry, investigation or challenge by the SEC or other Governmental Authority
specifically targeted at the Purchaser. Since December 31, 2016, the
Purchaser's independent public accounting  firm has not informed the
Purchaser that it has any material questions, challenges or disagreements
regarding or pertaining to the Purchaser's accounting policies or practices.

 


 

 

(d) The Purchaser has established and maintains disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Purchaser, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known  to the Purchaser's principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and such  disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure all such information is
communicated in a timely fashion to the Purchaser's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
the  disclosure of such information in the Purchaser's periodic and current
reports required under the Exchange Act.

 


 

 

(e) The Purchaser and its subsidiaries have established and maintained a
system  of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of the Purchaser's financial reporting and the
preparation of the Purchaser  financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Purchaser has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Purchaser's auditors and audit committee (i)  any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Purchaser's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii)  any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls.

 

 

51  

(f) The Purchaser is in compliance, and has complied since December 31, 2016,
in  each case, in all material respects, with (i) the applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 


 

 

Section 5.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2018, there has
not been any Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

Section 5.11 _Compliance with Law; Actions and Litigation_. Except as set
forth in the Purchaser SEC Documents or as would not reasonably be expected, 
individually or in the aggregate to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are, and for the last three (3)
years have been, in compliance with all applicable Laws. Except as disclosed
in the Purchaser SEC  Documents, there are no Actions pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened, or, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser,
any material investigations pending or threatened, against or relating to the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,  any of such Person's respective assets
or properties or any present or former officer or director of such Person in
his or her capacity as such, in each case except as would not reasonably be
expected individually or in the aggregate to have a  Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

Section 5.12 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. The Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agree that the representations and  warranties made by the
Seller and the Company in Article III and Article IV (as modified by the

Letter and the  Company Disclosure Letter, respectively) of this Agreement,
subject to the limitations and restrictions specified herein, shall have any
legal effect. Any and all statements or information communicated by the

hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand in connection with any
filings or  submissions made pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) and if
requested, accept reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the
other party in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
correspondence or  communications provided to the other party pursuant to
this sentence, may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Purchaser, Seller or the Company Group, (B) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, and  (C) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any applicable Law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each of the Purchaser, the  Seller and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
7.1(b) as "Outside Counsel Only Material" which such material and the 
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,

in advance from  the source of the materials (the Purchaser on the one hand
or the Seller or the Company on the other) or its legal counsel.

(c) None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in or
attend  any meeting, (whether in person, via telephone or otherwise) or
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of the Transactions,
Action (including the settlement of any Action) or other inquiry unless it
offers, in the case of the  Purchaser, the Sellers and the Company, and in
the case of the Sellers and the Company, the Purchaser, in advance and subject

delayed). Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to each
other all information required for any filing, form, declaration,

contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, in connection with
proceedings under or relating to  any applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_
, that each of the Purchaser, the Seller and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this  Section 7.1(b) as "Outside Counsel

disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or  directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (the Purchaser on the one hand or the Seller or the Company on
the other) or its legal counsel.

 

 

59  

In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser shall
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to effect the Transactions
prior to the Outside Date, including  taking all such action as may be
necessary to resolve any objections asserted with respect to the Transactions
under any Law or by any Governmental Authority and resolve or eliminate all
such objections, including (i) using reasonable best efforts  to contest any
Action that may be instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Transactions, unless, by mutual agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser
mutually decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests;
and  (ii) to the extent necessary to obtain the waiver or consent from any
Governmental Authority required to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section
8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b), (A) proffering and consenting and agreeing to an
Order or other agreement  providing for the sale, licensing or other
disposition, or the holding separate of, or other limitations or restrictions
on, particular assets, categories of assets or lines of business of the
Company Group or the Purchaser or any of its  Subsidiaries, and (B) otherwise
offering to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of
taking and, if the offer is accepted, promptly taking or committing to take
such action as may be necessary to permit the lawful  consummation of the
Transactions prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , (X) the
Purchaser shall not be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect or
agree to any action that individually or in the aggregate would have  a
Company Material Adverse Effect; and (Y) the Purchaser shall not be required
to take any actions unless the effectiveness thereof is conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing. The Purchaser and the Company shall not (x) extend
any waiting  period or agree to re-file under the HSR Act (except with the
prior written consent of the other party hereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (y) enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority  agreeing not to consummate the Transactions.

 


 

 

(e) Neither the Company nor Purchaser shall take any action, including
acquiring  any asset, property, business or Person (by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, investment, other business combination, asset,
stock or equity purchase, or otherwise) that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect obtaining or  making any authorizations, exemptions,
certificates, registrations, clearances, consents, Orders, approvals, permits
or licenses contemplated by this Section 7.1 or the timely receipt thereof.

 


 

 

Section 7.2 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period,
the Seller and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Purchaser upon 
becoming aware of (i) any notices, complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any
Governmental Authorities with respect to the Transactions, (ii) any written
notices or other written  communications from any third Persons alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required with respect to the
Transactions, (iii) the institution of any material Action involving any
member of the Company Group relating to the  Transactions, (iv) any material
confidential information becoming compromised or (v) any breach or inaccuracy
of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the

or inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 on the Closing Date.

 

 

60  

Section 7.3 _Public Announcements_. Any public announcement or communication
pertaining to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be issued in such
form  as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser, and
no party hereto shall issue or otherwise make any public announcement or
communication pertaining to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior written consent of the  Seller and the Purchaser; _provided_ , that if
any such public announcement or communication is required by applicable Law,
GAAP or the rules and regulations of a stock exchange or trading system to be
made by any party hereto, then such party  shall be permitted to make such
public announcement or communication so long as, prior to issuing such public
announcement or communication, such party shall (a) use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the Seller and the Purchaser  regarding
the contents of such public announcement or communication, (b) deliver a draft
of such public announcement or communication to the Seller and the Purchaser,
(c) give the Seller and the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon  and (d) use commercially reasonable efforts to incorporate such
comments therein.

the Company shall not, and shall cause the Owners and the Affiliates and 
Representatives of the Seller, the Company and the Owners not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (b) enter into discussions or negotiations
with, or  provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible
Acquisition Proposal; or (c) enter into any agreements or other instruments

Company shall immediately cease  and cause to be terminated, and shall cause
the Owners and the Affiliates and Representatives of the Seller, the Company
and the Owners to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons  conducted heretofore with
respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Seller and the
Company will promptly notify the Purchaser in the event that the Seller or the
Company or the Owners or any of the Affiliates or  Representatives of the
Seller, the Company and the Owners receive any request for information or
proposal relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal.

 


 

 

Section 7.5 _Employee Matters._

 


 

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will, and will cause its 
Subsidiaries (and will cause any other Person providing compensation and
benefits on their behalf), for a period of no less than one (1) year following
the Closing Date, to provide individuals who are employed by any member of the
Company Group  immediately prior to the Closing Date and who remain employed
by the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (the " _Employees_ ") with (i) salaries
and wages that are no less favorable than those provided to each Employee
immediately prior to the  Closing Date and (ii) bonus, commission and
incentive opportunities and employee benefits that are comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to the Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date, subject to the exceptions set forth in  Section 7.5(a)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of this
Section 7.5(a) shall be construed as a limitation on the right of Purchaser to
amend or terminate in accordance with its terms any Benefit Plan  which any
member of the Company Group would otherwise have under the terms of such
Benefit Plan, and no provision of this _Section 7.5(a)_ shall be construed to
create a right in any employee or beneficiary of such employee under a
Benefit  Plan that such employee or beneficiary would not otherwise have
under the terms of such plan.

 

 

61  

(b) The Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates shall cause all of their
benefit  plans, policies or arrangements under which Employees participate to
recognize service with the Company Group (including predecessors) prior to the
Closing Date, for all purposes to the same extent recognized by the Company
Group under a  corresponding Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date,
_provided_ , that such service recognition shall not be required for purposes
of retiree medical programs, for purposes of benefit accrual under defined
benefit pension or retirement  plans, or where such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits (or where similar credit is not given to other
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser).

 


 

 

(c) With respect to all welfare benefit plans maintained by the Purchaser or
its  Affiliates for the benefit of the Employees on and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable member of the Company Group
or such plan to, make commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all
limitations as to  pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
applicable to the Employees (and their covered dependents), and (ii) in
determining any deductible, out-of-pocket limitations, co-payments or similar
requirements under health care plans,  give full credit towards satisfying
any applicable deductible or similar requirements for the applicable plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs with respect to an amount equal to the excess
of the total expenses paid by any Employee during  the portion of the
applicable plan year prior to the Closing Date pursuant to all Benefit Plans
that are health care plans.

 


 

 

(d) The Employee List shall be updated by the Company as of three (3)
Business  Days prior to the Closing Date (and shall include years of service
credit (recognizing any cumulative service) and status (active or on statutory
or employer approved leave and full-time or part-time)) and provided to the
Purchaser no later than  the Closing Date.

 


 

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.5, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon  any Person (including any current or former director, officer or
employee of, or consultant or independent contractor to, the Purchaser, any
member of the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates) any third
party beneficiary or other  rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period or continued
participation in any benefit plan, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 7.5. No provision of this  Section 7.5 is intended
to and such provisions do not modify, amend or create any employee benefit
plan of the Purchaser, any member of the Company Group or any of their
respective Affiliates.

Section 7.6 _[Reserved]_

 


 

 

Section 7.7 _Financing._

 


 

 

(a) (1) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to  be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including any flex provisions) described in the Commitment Letter, including
using reasonable best  efforts to (w) maintain in effect the Commitment
Letter and any Definitive Documents, (x) negotiate, enter into and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive
Documents_ ") on the terms and conditions  (including any flex provisions)
contained in the Commitment Letter (or on terms and conditions, taken as a
whole, no less favorable to the Purchaser than the terms and conditions
(including any flex provisions) in the Commitment Letter and that  would not
adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (y) comply with its obligations under the
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Documents, and (z) satisfy (or, if
reasonably  required to obtain the Debt Financing, obtain the waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter and such
Definitive Documents applicable to the Purchaser that are within its control.

 


 

 

(ii) In the event that all conditions set forth in Section 8.1  and Section
8.2 (except those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing;
provided that such conditions would be so satisfied as of such date) have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived, the
Purchaser  shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing
Sources to fund the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, to the extent the
proceeds thereof are required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall  enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter
(including in the event of any breach or purported breach thereof).

 


 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, 
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Documents, or substitute other debt
financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same or
alternative financing sources,  including to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, amend titles, allocations
and the fee arrangements with respect to the existing  and additional
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities and
implement or exercise any flex provisions set forth in the Commitment Letter
on the date hereof; provided that no such amendment, replacement,
supplement,  modification or waiver shall, without the prior written consent
of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid  or original issue discount in respect of the Debt
Financing (except as set forth in, or as a result of the exercise of, any flex
provisions set forth in the Commitment Letter on the date hereof)) to an
amount that, together with the Purchaser's  and its Subsidiaries' cash on
hand or available committed credit facilities, would on the Closing Date be
less than the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of  the
Commitment Letter in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be
expected to (A) prevent or materially delay the funding of the Debt Financing
on the Closing Date or (B) materially adversely impact the ability of the
Purchaser or its  Affiliates to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing
Sources under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Documents relative to
its ability to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof. The Purchaser shall  promptly following execution thereof deliver to
the Company copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or
waiver of the Commitment Letter (with only the fee amounts, interest rates and
other "flex" terms redacted (none of  which redacted provisions would be
reasonably expected to adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing)) or the Definitive Documents.

 

 

63  

(c) The Purchaser shall give the Company prompt written notice if (i) the 
Purchaser obtains knowledge of any material breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without due notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to the  Commitment Letter or the Definitive Documents, (ii) the
Purchaser receives any written notice or other written communication
(including email), in each case, from any Person providing the Debt Financing
with respect to any actual or threatened  breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Document,
in each case, with respect to any material provision thereof or (iii) the
Purchaser no longer believes in good faith that it will be  able to obtain
all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated by any of the Commitment Letter
or the Definitive Documents; provided that, notwithstanding any other
provision  hereof, in no event shall the Purchaser be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client privilege. If any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, the Purchaser shall (x)
promptly notify the  Company of such unavailability and (y) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing sufficient to enable
the Purchaser to consummate the Transactions on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to  the Purchaser than the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Documents, as applicable. For purposes of this
Agreement, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the  financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified by this Section 7.7 (and any alternate
financing obtained in accordance with this Section 7.7), and "Commitment
Letter" and  "Definitive Documents" shall include, respectively, such
documents as permitted to be amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified by this Section 7.7 (and such documents related to such alternative
debt financing entered into in  accordance with this Section 7.7).

 


 

 

(d) From the date hereof until the Closing (or the earlier termination of
this  Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1), subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 7.7, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives  to, in each case at the Purchaser's sole expense,
use reasonable best efforts to provide customary and reasonable cooperation to
the Purchaser in connection with the arrangement, marketing, underwriting,
syndication and consummation of any debt  or equity financing deemed
reasonably necessary or advisable by the Purchaser in connection with the
Transactions, including the Debt Financing (the " _Financing_ "), including
using reasonable best efforts to:

 


 

 

(i) assist with the preparation of Offering Documents,  including furnishing
reasonable and customary representation and authorization letters in
connection therewith as they apply to information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including customary representations regarding the accuracy
of  the information provided by the Company contained therein);

 

 

64  

(ii) participate (and using reasonable best efforts to cause  members of
senior management of the Company to participate) in customary marketing
efforts, including a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows,
sessions with rating agencies and drafting sessions with financing sources 
(including the Debt Financing Sources) and actual and prospective
underwriters, lenders and investors in the Financing;

 


 

 

(iii) execute and deliver, subject to the occurrence of the  Closing Date,
certificates and definitive documents related to the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser and, in connection with the Debt Financing,
facilitating the pledging of, and granting, recording and perfection of
security  interests in and Liens on, share certificates, securities and other
collateral, subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date;

 


 

 

(iv) provide at least three Business Days (as defined in the  Commitment
Letter) prior to the Closing Date all documentation and other information
required by U.S. regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the Uniting and 
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 to the extent requested at least eight Business
Days (as defined in the Commitment Letter) prior to the anticipated Closing
Date;

 


 

 

(v) to assist the Purchaser in satisfying the conditions  precedent set forth
in the Commitment Letter to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the
cooperation of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives;

 


 

 

(vi) periodically update or supplement any information  required pursuant to
clause (b) of Section 4 of the Commitment Letter or Section 4 of Exhibit B to
the Commitment Letter (" _Required Information_ ") provided to the Purchaser
or financing sources (including the Debt Financing Sources) to the  extent
that any such Required Information is not Compliant;

 


 

 

(vii) furnish all financial information related to the Company  and its
Subsidiaries that is reasonably requested by the Purchaser, and using
reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accountants to assist in
furnishing such information, in connection with the Purchaser's preparation of
pro forma  financial information and financial statements to be included in
any Offering Documents (provided, however, that the Purchaser acknowledges
that the preparation of such pro forma financial information and financial
statements is the  responsibility of the Purchaser, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have no responsibility (except as set forth herein) for, and make
no representation regarding, the resultant pro forma information);

 


 

 

(viii) subject to customary confidentiality agreements,  reasonably cooperate
with financing sources' (including the Debt Financing Sources') customary due
diligence efforts, including access to documentation and "factual backup"
support reasonably and customarily requested by such financing sources 
(including the Debt Financing Sources) and their counsel; and

 

 

65  

(ix) cause their independent auditors to provide, consistent  with customary
practice, consents to the use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing or Current Reports on Form 8-K and other documents to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to deliver customary comfort 
letters (including customary negative assurance and change period comfort) to
the financing sources (including the Debt Financing Sources).

 


 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement 
(including this Section 7.7): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including this
Section 7.7) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it would
(1) interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries,  (2) encumber any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to Closing, (3) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other fee, make any other payment,
reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur  any liabilities or give any
indemnities prior to the Closing (unless contingent upon the Closing or paid
directly in full by the Purchaser on behalf of the Company or any such
Subsidiary prior to the effectiveness thereof), (4) require the  Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to authorize any corporate action that would become
effective and operative prior to Closing or (5) require the Company and/or any
Subsidiary to make any representation, warranty or certification that, in
the  good faith determination of the Company, is not true and (ii) no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement,
certificate, document, instrument, consent or opinion executed pursuant to the
foregoing shall be effective  until the Closing (provided, however, that the
Company shall provide, prior to Closing to the extent reasonably requested by
the Purchaser, reasonable and customary representation and authorization
letters with respect to any Offering Documents  as they apply to information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries). The Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to Closing.

 


 

 

(f) The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its 
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a
result of the Financing (including any alternative financing) (including any
information  utilized in connection therewith, other than any information
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries provided by or on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith), in
each case other than to the extent  any of the foregoing arises from the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of
Section 7.7(d) of this Agreement by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives. The Purchaser shall,  promptly upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
and accountants' fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in 
connection with or as a result of the Financing (including any alternative
financing) (including with respect to the financial information delivered
under this Section 7.7 and under Section 7.13 and any information utilized in
connection  therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall bear
all such costs related to its obligations with respect to the preparation,
review, delivery and audit of historical information relating to the Company
or its Subsidiaries  substantially in the form and substance that the Company
customarily produces). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing; provided, however, that
such logos are used solely in a  manner that is not intended, or reasonably
likely, to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

66  

Section 7.8 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access and
Confidentiality._

 


 

 

(a) The Purchaser shall preserve and keep, and cause the Company Group to 
preserve and keep, information and books and records held by any member of the
Company Group relating to the Seller in accordance with Purchaser's regular
bona fide document retention policies, during  which time the Purchaser shall
make such information and books and records available to the Seller as the
Seller may reasonably require in connection with any audit, investigation,
dispute or litigation with a third party, _provided_ , that  the Seller shall
reimburse the Purchaser for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in connection with any such request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) any such access rights shall be exercised in such manner  as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
Group or the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) the Purchaser may
withhold any document (or portions thereof) or information to the extent that
(x) it may not  be disclosed pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure
agreement with a third party; _provided,_ that the Purchaser shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of such restriction or otherwise seek to
provide access to such information  in a manner that does not violate such
restriction, or (y) the disclosure would cause the Purchaser or any member of
the Company Group to waive its attorney-client privilege with respect to such
information; _provided,_ that the Purchaser  shall use reasonable efforts to
provide access to such information in a manner that does not violate such
privilege.

 


 

 

(b) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing, the Seller shall, and 
shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, keep all
documents, materials, records and other information that it has or has
obtained prior to or after the Closing regarding the Purchaser or any member
of the Company Group  strictly confidential and will not disclose such
information without the Purchaser's prior written consent; _provided_ , that
the foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply to any information generally
available to, or known by, the public  (other than as a result of disclosure
in violation of this Section 7.8(b)), or (ii) prohibit any disclosure (A)
required by Law so long as, to the extent legally permissible and feasible,
Seller or such Affiliate or Representative provides  Purchaser with
reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to
contest such disclosure or (B) made in connection with the enforcement of any
right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction 
Documents.

 


 

 

(c) Effective as of the Closing, all of the restrictions on and obligations
of  the Purchaser in the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically
terminate in their entirety (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such
provisions that purport to survive termination of the Confidentiality
Agreement).

 

 

67  

Section 7.9 _NYSE Listing_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall prepare
and file with the NYSE a supplemental listing application with respect to
the  Closing Stock Consideration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, approval of the
listing of the Purchaser Shares constituting the Closing Stock Consideration,
subject only to  official notice to the NYSE of issuance.

 


 

 

Section 7.10 _Lock-Up of Certain Purchaser Shares_. With respect to the
number of Purchaser Shares constituting a portion of the Closing Stock
Consideration  equal to the quotient of $25,000,000 _divided by_ the
Purchaser Share Price (the " _Locked-Up Purchaser Shares_ "), for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Seller shall  not (other
than pursuant to Section 2.10), and shall cause the Permitted Transferees not
to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, offer, sell, contract to sell, transfer, pledge, grant any option
to purchase,  make any short sale or otherwise dispose of (each such
transaction, a " _Transfer_ ") any Locked-Up Purchaser Shares or any options
or warrants to purchase any Locked-Up Purchaser Shares, or any Securities
convertible into, exchangeable for or  that represent the right to receive
shares of the Locked-Up Purchaser Shares, or engage in any hedging or other
transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead
to or result in a sale or disposition of the Locked-Up  Purchaser Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.10 shall prevent or
restrict the Permitted Transferees from pledging any of the Purchaser Shares
to any bona fide third party  lender or Transferring any of the Purchaser
Shares (a) in connection with a sale of the Purchaser approved by the Board of
Directors of the Purchaser (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of shares
of capital stock, other business combination  transaction, sale of all or

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER  JURISDICTION. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH
ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OR
AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH  REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND SUCH LAWS. THE ISSUER

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights
Agreement,  upon either the sale of the Purchaser Shares constituting Closing

efforts to cooperate with the Seller to exchange the Seller's certificates for
such relevant Purchaser Shares for new certificates not bearing a legend
restricting transfer under the Securities  Act, and shall provide such
certificates, documents and/or legal opinions as the Purchaser and the
Purchaser's registrar and transfer agent may reasonably request in connection
therewith.

(ii) solely in the event that the Closing  shall not have occurred on or
before March 1, 2020, the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Seller and
its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and audited consolidated statements
of income and cash flows of the Seller and its Subsidiaries  for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2019, in each case, that are Compliant and in a form
substantially similar to the audited financial statements delivered by the
Seller prior to the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the 
Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to the Seller
and the Company Group in connection with the preparation and delivery of such
financial statements in substantially the same manner that the Purchaser has
provided such  cooperation and assistance prior to the date of this Agreement
in connection with the preparation of such financial statements. The Seller
agrees as requested by the Purchaser from time to time to use reasonable best
efforts to assist the  Purchaser in obtaining the consent of the Seller's
independent auditor consistent with customary practice, to include the

Policy to expressly exclude rights of subrogation against the Seller and its
Affiliates other than solely against a  Seller with respect to actual fraud
by such Seller in connection with this Agreement. Purchaser covenants and
agrees that it will not execute or deliver any amendment to the RandW Insurance
Policy in any manner that is adverse to the Seller or  any of its Affiliates
without the Seller's prior express written consent.

 


 

 

Section 7.15 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation._

 


 

 

(a) Each Designated Shareholder agrees that, from the Closing Date until the
four  (4) year anniversary of the Closing Date, such Designated Shareholder
shall not, and shall each cause its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, whether as employer, employee, proprietor, owner, shareholder,
partner, consultant,  agent, lender, guarantor, member, trustee or otherwise
(but in each case other than in the proper performance of such Designated
Shareholder's duties to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates at any time
during which such Designated Shareholder  is an employee of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates), engage in a Competing Business, own, manage, have
control of or participate or invest in, by itself or in combination with other

attempt to interfere in a manner adverse to Purchaser and or any of its
Affiliates with the business relationships within the scope of the Competing
Business of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the members of the  Company Group) with such clients or potential clients. As
used in this Agreement, " _Competing Business_ " shall mean the manufacture,
marketing, or sale of dental products of the nature sold or offered for sale
by the Company Group or in  development by the Company Group during the two-
year period prior to the Closing Date anywhere in the continent of North
America.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 7.15(a)_ , each Designated Shareholder and its 
controlled Affiliates may acquire and hold, as a passive investment,
securities of (i) the Purchaser or (ii) any other Person that to the extent
that such investment does not directly or indirectly confer upon such
Designated Shareholder or any  of its controlled Affiliates, alone or
collectively, more than 5% of the voting power with respect to, or interests
in the profits of, such Person. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, at any time after the  two (2) year anniversary
of the Closing Date that a Designated Shareholder is no longer an employee of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, such Designated Shareholder may become employed
by, otherwise become actively involved with, or have a passive  financing
interest in, one or more private equity or other investment funds, advisers or
managers that directly or indirectly own, advise, operate or manage a
Competing Business so long as such Designated Shareholder does not directly
or  indirectly render services to, or become involved in, or otherwise engage
in, the Competing Business owned, operated or managed by such Person.

 

 

70  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the time, scope, geographic
area  and other provisions of this Section 7.15 have been specifically
negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and agree that all such
provisions are reasonable under the circumstances of the purchase and sale of
the Membership Interests and of  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Designated Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the terms
of this Section 7.15 (i) are reasonable in light of all of the circumstances,
(ii) are sufficiently limited to protect the  legitimate interests of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, (iii) impose no undue hardship on any Designated
Shareholder and (iv) are not injurious to the public. Each Designated
Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants  and other
agreements contained in this Section 7.15 are an essential part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, constitute a material
inducement to the Purchaser's entering into and performing its obligations
under this  Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, are an essential
part of the Purchaser's willingness to pay the Consideration. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained in this Section 7.15 is held  to cover a geographic area or to be
for a length of time that is not permitted by Law, or is in any way construed
to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be
construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent  such
provision would then be valid or enforceable under Law, such provision shall
be construed and interpreted or reformed to provide for a restriction or
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions  as shall be valid and enforceable under Law.

 


 

 

Section 7.16 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party to this Agreement agrees to execute such documents
and  other papers and use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to
be taken all action and to perform or cause to be performed all things and
acts reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and to  consummate the Transactions. No document executed
pursuant to this Section 7.16 shall be deemed to expand or limit the rights
and obligations of the parties hereto beyond those provided in this Agreement
or provide for any additional rights or  obligations of the parties hereto
that are not provided for in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of any such documents and this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control.

 


 

 

Section 7.17 _Indemnification and Insurance._

 


 

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Purchaser agrees
that  it shall cause the Company to indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former director, officer and employee of the Company Group against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages  or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to,  at or after the Closing Date, to
the same extent such Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement
of expenses as of the date hereof by the applicable member of the Company
Group pursuant to and subject to the limitations of, the  Company Group
member's Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in
effect as of the date hereof and made available to the Purchaser prior to the
date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser shall cause the 
Company Group, for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing
Date, (i) to maintain provisions in its Organizational Documents concerning
the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of  the Company Group member's former and current officers,
directors and employees that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company Group member, as
applicable, in each case, as of the  date of this Agreement, (ii) not to
amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except
as required by Law, and (iii) to maintain and not amend,  repeal or otherwise
modify any indemnification agreements with any director, officer or employee
of any member of the Company Group in effect as of the date hereof and made
available to the Purchaser prior to the date hereof.

 

 

71  

(b) The Company shall cause coverage to be extended under its current
directors'  and officers' liability insurance policies by obtaining, at or
prior to the Closing, a prepaid, non‑cancelable six‑year "tail" policy
(containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage) with respect to matters  existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date ( _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, the Company shall not pay an amount for such "tail" policy in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the  Company prior to the
date hereof) and if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period,
any insurance required to be maintained under this Section 7.17 shall be
continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.  Each
of Purchaser and the Company shall bear one-half (1/2) of the cost of such
tail policy paid by the Company in accordance with this Section 7.17(b).

Section 9.2 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 


 

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant  to this Article IX (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of the
commencement of any Action involving a third party (such Action, a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto
is to be made  against any party or parties obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party Claim (i)
describing in reasonable detail in light of  the circumstances then known to
such Indemnified Party the nature of such Action, (ii) including a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Action (to the extent in the possession of
the Indemnified Party) and (iii) specifying the estimated  amount of the
Losses, if known (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "); provided that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
(x)  such failure to give notice shall prejudice any defense or claim
available to the Indemnifying Party or (y) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim in accordance with
this Section 9.2(a) prior to the  expiration of the applicable survival
period (if any) set forth in Section 9.4(a).

 


 

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party may undertake and assume the defense of such
Third  Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense within
sixty (60) days of receiving such Third Party Claim Notice with
representatives chosen by it. During such sixty (60)-day period, the
Indemnified Party may make such filings,  including motions for continuance
(and answers if a motion for continuance has not been granted), as may be
necessary to preserve the parties' positions and rights with respect to such
Third Party Claim, and shall reasonably cooperate with the  Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, then (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel and one
appropriate local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction of the Indemnified 
Party's choosing and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim. The
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, including if in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified
Party's  counsel, representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests of or defenses available to such parties, and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall keep the  Indemnified Party advised of the status of the Third
Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall reasonably consider
recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. In
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the  Indemnifying Party may
reserve its rights to claim that indemnification is not required if, for
example, new or subsequently developed information demonstrates that the
Indemnifying Party is not required to indemnify the Indemnified Party.

 

 

76  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party, within sixty (60) days after written notice of
any  such Third Party Claim does not assume control of the defense or
thereafter fails or ceases to defend such Third Party Claim, then (i) the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense of such Third
Party Claim and (ii) the  reasonable and documented fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party in connection therewith shall be considered
"Losses" for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the fees and expenses  of more than one counsel and any one
appropriate local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction for the Indemnified
Party with respect to a single Third Party Claim or a series of related Third
Party Claims be considered "Losses" for purposes of  this Agreement.

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.2 to the contrary, (i) the 
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment  which (A) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party
of an unconditional release from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (B) would impose a judgment that  provides for anything other than
monetary damages, or (C) would impose a judgment of monetary damages in excess
of the remaining amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent  of the
Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgement.

 


 

 

(e) The parties hereto shall act in good faith in responding to, defending 
against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all information
relevant thereto  subject to Section 6.3. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other party, upon request,
copies of all correspondence,  pleadings, motions, briefs, appeals or other
written statements relating to or submitted in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Claim, and timely notices of, and the right to participate (as
an observer) in any hearing or other court  proceeding, meeting or
negotiation relating to the Third Party Claim.

 


 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing provisions
of  this Section 9.2 shall not apply with respect to Taxes or any Tax
Proceeding.

 


 

 

Section 9.3 _Procedure for Claims Not Involving Third Parties_.

 


 

 

(a) An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under
this  Article IX that does not involve a Third Party Claim shall deliver a
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), promptly upon becoming aware of such
claim, to the Indemnifying Party, which shall (i) state in reasonable detail
the circumstances  giving rise to the Losses and the basis for such claim
under this Agreement, (ii) specify the estimated amount of the Losses, if
known, and (iii) make a request for any payment then believed due. The failure
of an Indemnified Party to provide a  Claim Notice in accordance with this
Section 9.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations to
provide indemnification hereunder except (x) to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby or (y) if the Indemnified  Party
fails to notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim in accordance
with this Section 9.3(a) prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period (if any) set forth in Section 9.4(a). The Indemnifying Party may,
within  forty-five (45) days after receipt by such Indemnifying Party of a
Claim Notice, deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response disputing
such claim.

 

 

77  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing provisions
of  this Section 9.3 shall not apply with respect to Taxes and any Tax
Proceedings.

(a) _Survival_.

the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of this
Agreement until the Release Date, at which time they shall expire, except for
the Seller Fundamental Representations, the Company Fundamental 
Representations and the Purchaser Fundamental Representations, which shall
survive the Closing until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, at which time they shall expire. The right
to indemnification  for Excluded Taxes shall survive the Closing of this
Agreement until the Release Date, at which time it shall expire. The right to
indemnification for Excluded Taxes and any inaccuracy or breach (or claim of
such) of any representation or  warranty set forth in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted, or knowledge acquired, with
respect to the accuracy of such representation or warranty (it being
understood that the foregoing shall not limit the lead-in  paragraph to
_Article III,_ _Article IV_ or _Article V_ ).

 


 

 

(ii) All covenants and agreements of the parties hereto set  forth in this
Agreement that require performance prior to the Closing shall survive the
Closing until the Release Date, at which time they shall expire. All covenants
and other agreements of the parties hereto set forth in this Agreement that 
require performance from and after the Closing shall survive the Closing and
shall continue in accordance with their terms until such covenant or agreement
is performed.

 


 

 

(iii) If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in  writing pursuant
to Section 9.2 or 9.3 or in respect of Taxes, in each case, prior to the
expiration, as provided in this Section 9.4(a), of the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is the basis for such claim, then such 
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and the Indemnifying Party's
indemnification obligations with respect thereto shall survive past the date
on which they would otherwise expire until, but only for the purpose of, the
resolution of  such claim.

 

 

78  

(b) _Deductible_.

 


 

 

(i) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to  indemnification
under Section 9.1(a)(i) with respect to any claim for indemnification unless

that are the subject of such claim exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per-Claim Basket_
"),     and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification for Losses claimed under Section 9.1(a)(i) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in respect of such claims,  taken together (excluding amounts below
the Per-Claim Basket), exceeds $2,718,750 (the " _Deductible_ "), at which
time all Losses incurred in excess of the Deductible, subject to the Per-Claim
Basket, shall be indemnifiable claims hereunder  (subject to all the other
terms and conditions set forth herein); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Deductible and the Per-Claim Basket shall not apply to (A) claims with respect
to actual fraud (B) claims with respect to any breaches  of any Seller
Fundamental Representation or Company Fundamental Representation and (C) any
representations or warranties with respect to Taxes.

Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for Losses
claimed under Section 9.1(b)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of such claims,
taken  together (excluding amounts below the Per-Claim Basket), exceeds the
Deductible, at which time all Losses incurred in excess of the Deductible
shall be indemnifiable claims hereunder (subject to all the other terms and
conditions set forth  herein); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible
and the Per-Claim Basket shall not apply to (A) claims with respect to actual
fraud and (B) claims with respect to any breaches of any Purchaser Fundamental
Representation.

 


 

 

(c) _Cap_.

 


 

 

(i) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses  payable by the
Seller under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(a)(iii) in respect of all claims
made thereunder shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to  claims with respect
to (A) actual fraud and (B) claims with respect to any breaches of any Seller
Fundamental Representation or Company Fundamental Representation. The maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses payable by the Seller under  (x)
Section 9.1(a)(i) in respect of all claims with respect to breaches of any
Seller Fundamental Representation or Company Fundamental Representation and
(y) Section 9.1(a)(ii) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Closing
Cash  Consideration plus the Closing Stock Consideration Amount, in each
case, other than claims with respect to actual fraud.

 


 

 

(ii) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses  payable by the
Purchaser under Section 9.1(b)(i) in respect of all claims made thereunder

exceed the aggregate amount of the Closing Cash Consideration plus the Closing

79  

(d) _Amounts Reflected as Purchase Price Adjustments_. No Purchaser 
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) in respect of any amount to the extent that such amount was
included in the Actual Working Capital, the Actual Net Indebtedness or the
Actual Acquisition  Expenses and, in each case, actually reduced the
Consideration otherwise payable by the Purchaser. No Seller Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(b) in
respect of any amount to the extent that  such amount was included in the
Actual Working Capital, the Actual Net Indebtedness or the Actual Acquisition
Expenses and, in each case, actually increased the Consideration otherwise
payable by the Purchaser.

 


 

 

(e) _Satisfaction of Seller Indemnity Claims_. Except  with respect to claims
for actual fraud, the Purchaser (on behalf of itself and the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties) and the Seller hereby agree that (i) indemnification
claims made by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to  Section
9.1(a)(i) or 9.1(a)(iii) shall be satisfied solely from the Indemnity Escrow
Account ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
claims with respect to any breaches of any Seller Fundamental Representation
or  Company Fundamental Representation); (ii) indemnification claims made by
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (A) pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) in
the case of claims with respect to any breaches of any Seller Fundamental
Representation or  Company Fundamental Representation or (B) pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)(ii) shall in the case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) be
satisfied, first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account (if any funds remain at
such time), then from the RandW  Insurance Policy (to the extent recourse in
respect of the applicable Loss is available under the RandW Insurance Policy)
and to the extent recourse in respect of the applicable Loss is not available
under the RandW Insurance Policy, at the  option of the Purchaser, by (I)
indemnification by the Seller pursuant to this Article IX or (II) a
withholding from and an offset against any Earnout Amounts that would
otherwise be due to the Seller under the Earnout Agreement (to the extent 
such indemnification claims have been finally determined to be due and payable
to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Parties at or prior to the time such
Earnout Amount would otherwise be required to be paid in accordance with the
Earnout  Agreement). In the case of the foregoing clause (II), if the
applicable Earnout Payment in respect of which such withholding and offset is
to be made is payable in cash and in Purchaser Shares, such withholding and
offset shall be made pro rata in cash and in Purchaser Shares (for this
purpose ascribing a value to each such Purchaser Share of the "Purchaser Share
Price" as defined in the Earnout Agreement as of the date of such
withholding  and offset).

 


 

 

(f) _Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other  Third-Party Recoveries_. In
the event any Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) is entitled to any
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in
respect of any Losses for which such Indemnified Party has received 
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, such Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds,
payments or recoveries to the extent it would use such efforts if it were not
entitled to  indemnification hereunder; provided that the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates shall not be required to threaten or initiate any legal
proceedings against any customer, client, supplier or vendor of such
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates or  any Governmental Authority. In the
event that any such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-
party recoveries are realized by an Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates)
subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any  indemnification
payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries relate, the Indemnifying
Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the excess, if 
any, of (i) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under this
Article IX, plus the amount of such insurance payments or other recoveries
actually received by such Indemnified Party (less any increase in insurance
premiums arising  therefrom or related thereto and any Taxes resulting from
any such payments or other recoveries), over (ii) the amount of Losses with
respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has become entitled to
receive under this Article IX. In  cases where the Seller is the Indemnifying
Party, if such a refund is required and the applicable indemnification
payments were paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account, (i) if prior to or on
the Release Date, such amount will be deposited with the  Escrow Agent to be
held with the remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount and (ii) if after the Release
Date, such amount will be paid to the Seller.

 

 

80  

(g) _Punitive Damages_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to 
indemnification for any special, punitive, or exemplary damages except, in
each case, to the extent such damages are finally awarded and actually paid by
the Indemnified Party to an unaffiliated third party in connection with an
Action against  the Indemnified Party.

 


 

 

(h) _Tax Benefits or_ _Costs_. Each party hereto acknowledges and  agrees
that, for purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be (x) calculated based on
the amount of Losses that remain after deducting therefrom any cash Tax
benefits (net of any expenses incurred in obtaining the cash Tax benefits,
including any  Taxes imposed or payable in respect of the receipt or accrual
thereof) attributable to such Losses actually realized by the Indemnified
Party in the taxable year of such Loss and the subsequent taxable year (for
the avoidance of doubt,  determined taking into account the overall change,
if any, to Tax Purchase Price and the corresponding effect on the U.S. federal
(and applicable state and local) tax basis of the assets of the Company) and
(y) increased by any cash Tax cost of  the Indemnified Party attributable to
such Losses or the indemnification actually realized by the Indemnified Party
in the taxable year of such Loss and the subsequent taxable year.

 


 

 

(i) _No Duplicate Claims_. To the extent an Indemnified Party recovers 
Losses in respect of an indemnification claim under this Article IX, no other
Indemnified Party may recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement.

 


 

 

(j) _Exclusivity of Indemnity_. After the Closing, the rights of an 
Indemnified Party under this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of such Indemnified Party with respect to all contract claims under this
Agreement for breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements  contained herein or any right, claim or action arising from the
Transactions, except in the case of actual fraud or claims for specific
performance of covenants. All representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement are contractual in  nature only and subject to the sole and
exclusive remedies set forth in this Article IX. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser expressly waives, releases and agrees not to make any claim against
the other, or any of their respective Affiliates,  except for indemnification
claims made pursuant to this Article IX, or for any equitable relief pursuant
to Section 12.10; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall in no way
limit Purchaser's rights with respect to or under the  RandW Insurance Policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article IX shall limit the
operation of Section 2.8. Furthermore, the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
except in the case of actual fraud:

 

 

81  

(i) the Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their  rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the Transactions exclusively in contract pursuant
to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and hereby waive any
statutory and common law remedies, including remedies that may be  available
under Environmental Laws, with respect to matters relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to any environmental,
health or safety matters);

 


 

 

(ii) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the  terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement) or any Action otherwise arising out of or related to the 
Transactions shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach
of contract only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or
excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement);

 


 

 

(iii) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in  this Article IX
were specifically bargained for among the parties and were taken into account
by the parties in arriving at the Consideration; and

 


 

 

(iv) after the Closing, no Party or its Affiliates may seek  the rescission
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

ARTICLE X

 


 

 

PROCEDURES RELATING TO TAXES

 


 

 

Section 10.1 _Tax Returns._

 


 

 

(a) The Seller shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared
and  filed, all Pre-Closing Taxable Period Returns that are due (taking into
account any applicable extensions) on or before the Closing Date. The Sellers
shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due in respect of any Tax Return it
is responsible  for filing pursuant to this Section 10.1(a) to the applicable
Governmental Authority prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall timely
prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Pre-Closing
Taxable Period Returns that are  due (taking into account any applicable
extensions) after the Closing Date and any Straddle Period Return. All
reasonable and documented third-party costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and filing of (i) any Pre-Closing  Taxable
Period Return shall be borne and paid by the Seller and (ii) any Straddle
Period Return shall be equitably allocated between Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Seller, on the other hand, _provided_ , that such third-party costs
and  expenses do not exceed the third-party costs typically paid by Seller
for the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns for prior taxable years
(subject to reasonable adjustments to appropriately reflect any additional
complexity or any unique  issues (unrelated to Purchaser's acquisition of the
Company Group) arising on such Tax Returns). Subject to Seller's
indemnification obligations pursuant to Article IX, the Purchaser shall pay,
or cause the Company Group to pay, all Taxes due in  respect of any Tax
Return it is responsible for filing pursuant to this Section 10.1(a) to the
applicable Governmental Authority.

 

 

82  

(b) All Pre-Closing Taxable Period Returns and all Straddle Period Returns 
prepared and filed pursuant to Section 10.1(a) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Purchaser shall deliver any Tax Return for which it is responsible for
filing  pursuant to Section 10.1(a) with respect to which Purchaser is
seeking or may seek indemnification (or which may affect any Purchaser claim
for indemnification) pursuant to Article IX to the Seller for its review and
comment at least (x) in the  case of any such Tax Return that is required to
be filed within one (1) month following the Closing Date or that is a non-
income Tax Return, ten (10) days or such later time as reasonably practicable
or (y) in the case of any other such Tax  Return, twenty (20) days, in each
case prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed with
the relevant Tax authority (taking into account any applicable extensions). If
the Seller disputes any item on any such Tax Return,  then it shall notify
the Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection
no later than (A) in the case of a Tax Return described in clause (x) of the
preceding sentence, five (5) days or such later time as reasonably 
practicable or (B) in all other cases, ten (10) days, in each case, following
delivery of such Tax Return by the Purchaser. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which
the relevant  Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Purchaser and the
Seller cannot resolve any disputed item, then the item in question shall be
resolved by the Independent Auditor. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Auditor shall be borne  equally by the Seller, on the one hand,
and the Purchaser, on the other hand. If the Purchaser and Seller or the
Independent Auditor, as applicable, are unable to resolve all disputed items
prior to the due date (taking into account any  applicable extensions) for
the relevant Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be timely filed as prepared by
Purchaser (and reflecting any comments received from Seller that are not in
dispute), and following the resolution of all disputed items in  accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.1(b), Purchaser shall file or
cause to be filed an amended Tax Return reflecting such resolution.

 


 

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of any member of
the  Company Group that are payable with respect to any taxable period that
begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other similar Taxes
levied on a per  diem basis of any Person for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
Straddle Period that are in the  Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Tax Period and (ii) any
other Taxes of any Person for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as
if such Tax period ended on the Closing Date.   All determinations necessary
to give effect to the allocation set forth in the previous sentence shall be
made in a manner consistent with the prior practice the Company Group.

 

 

83  

(d) _CFC Taxes_. CFC Taxes shall be determined in accordance with the 
following assumptions and conventions: (i) the CFC Members shall be deemed to
have been owned by a "domestic corporation" (as defined in Section 7701 of the
Code) during the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date,
(ii) such  domestic corporation shall be deemed not to have generated any
item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or owned any assets other than
the stock of the CFC Members during such period, (iii) such domestic
corporation shall be deemed not to  have any other Tax attributes or
carryforwards, (iv) the Tax years of each CFC Member shall be deemed to have
ended on the Closing Date with all items of income, gain, deduction or loss
determined on a "closing of the books" basis and (v) each  CFC Member shall
be deemed to have made Tax elections in a manner consistent with past
practices of such CFC Member. In addition, the amount required to be included
by such domestic corporation under Sections 951 or 951A of the Code (and any 
deemed dividend pursuant to Sections 78 and 960(a)(1) attributable to such
amount) shall be reduced by the amount of gain of Seller attributable to the
sale of the CFC Members which will be recharacterized as a dividend pursuant
to Section 1248  of the Code (assuming that no dividends are paid by the CFC
Members to Purchaser or its Affiliates prior to the end of the Straddle
Period) but only to the extent provided for under Section 951(a)(2) of the
Code and the applicable Treasury  Regulations under Sections 951 and 951A of
the Code (taking into account the actual results of the CFC Member for the
Straddle Period and the Purchaser's actual holding period of the CFC Member
during the Straddle Period). For the avoidance of  doubt, the CFC Taxes of
Seller shall not be a negative number.

 


 

 

Section 10.2 _Contest Provisions._

 


 

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, except as provided in Sections 10.2(b) or
10.2(c)  below, the Purchaser shall control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding
of any member of the Company Group (any such Tax Proceeding a " _Tax Contest_
").

 


 

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller in
writing  within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates of written notice of the commencement of any Tax Contest
that relates to Taxes for which the Purchaser may seek indemnification under
Article IX; _provided_   that the failure of the Purchaser to provide such
notice shall not relieve the Seller of its obligations hereunder, except to
the extent that such failure to give notice shall actually prejudice any
defense or claim available to the Seller. The  Purchaser shall have the
exclusive right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period at its own expense (subject to Seller's
indemnification obligations under Article IX); _provided_ , that, if 
Purchaser would reasonably be expected to recover any Losses from such Tax
Contest pursuant to Article IX (for the avoidance of doubt, after taking into
account the limitations set forth in Section 9.4) (x) the Seller shall have
the right to  fully participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense and
(y) the Purchaser shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of
such Tax Contest to the extent that it affects the liability of the Seller
under Article IX without the  prior written consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have the exclusive right to 
control, settle, compromise and/or concede any Tax Proceeding of Seller or its
direct or indirect owners or with respect to any Tax Return of Seller or its
direct or indirect owners.

 

 

84  

Section 10.3 _Assistance and Cooperation_.

 


 

 

(a) The Seller and the Purchaser agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to  each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
(including access to books and records) and assistance as is reasonably
requested for the filing of any Tax Returns, the determination of any payment
obligations under Section  2.11(b), and the preparation, prosecution, defense
or conduct of any Tax Contest or any Tax Proceeding involving the Seller or
any of its direct or indirect owners.

 


 

 

(b) The Seller and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with each other
in  the conduct of any Tax Proceeding involving or otherwise relating to the
Company Group (or their income or assets). Any information obtained under this
Section 10.3(b) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in  connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of
any Tax Proceeding.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall
any  Person be entitled to review, inspect or receive originals or copies of
any Tax Returns of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than members
of the Company Group) and (ii) Purchaser shall have the sole and exclusive
right to control any  Tax Proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (other than any Tax Contest solely involving the members
of the Company Group).

 


 

 

Section 10.4 _Refunds._

 


 

 

(a) The Seller will be entitled to any credits arising from an overpayment by
a  member of the Company Group of Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, which
credit is in lieu of a cash refund, or refunds (including interest received
thereon) of Tax of a member of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, in each case, only  to the extent that such Tax being refunded, if it
were instead a deficiency, would otherwise be an Excluded Tax. In each case,
Seller shall be entitled to such credit or refund only to the extent that it
is actually realized by any member of the  Company Group (either as a cash
refund received or as a reduction of Taxes otherwise payable in lieu of a cash
refund), reduced by any reasonable, out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes)
incurred by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including  the Company
Group) in connection with the receipt or accrual of such credit or refund;
_provided_ , that the Seller shall not be entitled to any credits or refunds
(i) attributable to a carryback (or use) of any loss, deduction or other 
similar tax item arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) reflected in
Actual Working Capital, the Actual Net Indebtedness or the Actual Acquisition
Expenses and specifically identified as such or (iii) arising after the later
of (x) the  Release Date or (y) the date on which all claims for
indemnification by Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Taxes under Section
9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(a)(iii) are settled or otherwise resolved (the " _Tax
Release Date_ "). The Purchaser shall  cause the amount of any refund (or
portion thereof) or the amount of any credit (or portion thereof) to which the
Seller is entitled hereunder to either be paid to the Indemnity Escrow
Account, or allowed or applied against any Tax liability or  any Taxes for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are indemnified pursuant to Article
IX; _provided_ , that any such refund or credit received after the Release
Date and prior to the Tax Release Date may also be applied against (or 
reduced by) any Tax liability or any Tax that is an Excluded Tax but for which
Purchaser is no longer able to make a claim for indemnification under Section
9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(a)(iii) due to such Loss arising after the Release
Date.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
the Tax Release Date, Seller shall, upon Purchaser's request, promptly repay
to Purchaser any such amount Seller received under this Section 10.4(a) in the
event that Purchaser  or any member of the Company Group is required to repay
such refund or credit (including interest received thereon) to such
Governmental Authority.

 

 

85  

(b) Except as provided in Section 10.4(a), the Purchaser and its Affiliates
will  be entitled to any credits and refunds (including any interest received
thereon) of any member of the Company Group.

 


 

 

Section 10.5 _Conveyance Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the
other  hand, shall each be responsible for and shall pay one half of any
sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, excise,
real property transfer, or similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transfer
of the Membership Interests  to the Purchaser or its designated Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries hereunder (collectively, " _Conveyance Taxes_ "). The Purchaser
and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation and execution of
any Tax Returns required to be filed in  respect of any Conveyance Taxes.

 


 

 

Section 10.6 _Negative Covenants_. None of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Group) shall (i) except
as  provided in Section 10.1, amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify (or
cause to be amended, refiled, revoked or otherwise modified) any Tax Return of
the Company Group relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  nothing in this clause (i) shall prevent Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the foregoing (or file any
amended Tax Return required in  connection therewith), and neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority in connection
therewith, in each case subject to Section 10.2,  (ii) make or change (or
cause to be made or changed) any Tax election that has retroactive effect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any election under Section 338(g) of the
Code), (iii) file (or cause to be filed) a ruling request with any  Tax
authority that relates to the Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company Group for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) initiate (or cause to be initiated) any
voluntary disclosure or similar proceedings with any Tax authority regarding
any Tax or Tax  Return of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iv), if such action would have
more than a minimal adverse effect on the Tax liability of Seller, its direct
or indirect owners or any of their  Affiliates (affiliation being measured
following Closing), including any indemnification obligation of Seller under
Article IX, without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

Section 10.7 _Tax Treatment and Purchase Price Allocation_ _._

 


 

 

(a) The parties agree that for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) 
income Tax purposes, (a) the acquisition of the Membership Interests pursuant
to this Agreement shall be treated as a purchase and sale of all of the assets
of the Company (and of any other member of the Company Group that is
disregarded as  separate from the Company for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) that constitutes an "applicable asset acquisition" within the
meaning of Section 1060 of the Code, (b) any indemnification payments made
pursuant to Article IX, any Earnout Amounts  payable pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement and the Earnout Agreement and any payment made
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.11, in each case, shall be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price (except to the extent  of any
amounts in respect of imputed interest). None of the parties shall (and each
shall cause its Affiliates not to), take any position inconsistent with the
foregoing on any Tax Return or in connection with any Tax Proceeding,
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that this Section 10.7(a) shall not prevent
Purchaser, Seller or their Affiliates from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the
foregoing, and neither Purchaser,  Seller nor any of their Affiliates shall
be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment
by any Governmental Authority in connection therewith.

 

 

86  

(b) The methodology for the allocation of the of the Consideration (as
finally  determined pursuant to Section 2.8) and any other items that are
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date
(together with the Consideration, the " _Tax Purchase Price_ ") is set forth
on Schedule 10.7(b). No  later than sixty (60) days after the date on which
the Consideration is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.8, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Tax Purchase Price among the
assets of the Company (and of any  other member of the Company Group that is
disregarded as separate from the Company for U.S. federal income tax
purposes), including an allocation among the assets by jurisdiction determined
in a manner consistent with Section 1060 and, if  applicable, Section 338 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and in accordance
with Schedule 10.7(b) (the " _Seller 's Allocation_"); _provided_ , that the
parties agree the allocation need not follow the same  methodology as the
transfer pricing past practices of the Company Group. If Purchaser disagrees
with Seller's Allocation, Purchaser may, within twenty (20) days after
delivery of Seller's Allocation, deliver a written notice (the " _Purchaser
's  Allocation Notice_") to Seller to such effect, specifying those items as
to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchaser's proposed
allocation. If the Purchaser's Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Seller and
Purchaser shall,  during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Tax Purchase Price. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to  reach such agreement, they shall promptly
thereafter cause the Independent Auditor to resolve any remaining disputes.
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Auditor in connection with this Section  10.7(b) shall be borne
equally by Seller and Purchaser. Any allocation of the Tax Purchase Price
determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent Auditor shall
incorporate, reflect and be consistent with this Section 10.7(b) and the 
methodology described on Schedule 10.7(b). The allocation, as prepared by
Seller if no Purchaser's Allocation Notice has been given, as adjusted
pursuant to any agreement between Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the
Independent Auditor  in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence
(the " _Allocation_ ") shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. The
Allocation shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect
any payments made under this  Agreement or the Earnout Agreement for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall (and each
shall cause its respective Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent
with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in  connection with any Tax
Proceeding, _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 10.7(b) shall not
prevent Purchaser, Seller or their Affiliates from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon  or arising
out of the foregoing, and neither Purchaser, Seller nor any of their
Affiliates shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority in connection
therewith.

 

 

87  

Section 10.8 _Tax Sharing Agreement_. Any and all Tax Sharing Agreements to
which any member of the Company Group is a party shall be terminated as of
the  Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, no member of the
Company Group shall have any liability to make any payment pursuant to any
such agreement for any past or future period.

Affiliates' respective Representatives, shareholders, managers or partners and
all rights  and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except that any
such termination shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for any
and all Losses suffered by the other party hereto as a result of fraud or any
willful or intentional  breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions
of this Section 11.2 and Article XII shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement

intent of the parties as closely as  possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

and Schedules hereto and the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Company
Disclosure  Letter and the Purchaser Disclosure Letter) and the other

Section 12.5 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or 
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any

any liability or obligation  hereunder and (b) any of its Debt Financing
Sources as collateral security for the Purchaser's and its Affiliates'
obligations to such Debt Financing Sources (and such Debt Financing Sources
may exercise their rights and remedies with respect to  such security
interest); _provided_ , _further_ , that without written consent of any party
hereto, the Seller may assign its rights hereunder (a) to receive the Closing

other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of  this Agreement.

Document, and (c) waive  compliance with any of the agreements or conditions

94  

Section 12.18 _Legal Representation; Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 


 

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP (" _Prior Company 
Counsel_ ") has, on or prior to the Closing Date, represented the Seller, the
Company, and their respective Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and their
respective officers, employees and directors (each such Person, other than the
member of  the Company Group, a " _Designated Person_ ") in one or more
matters relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related an Action
arising under or related to this  Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
Transactions) (each, an " _Existing Representation_ "), and that, in the event
of any post-Closing matters (x) relating to this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the Transactions (including any  matter that may be related to
an Action related to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
Transactions) and (y) in which the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company Group), on the one hand, and one or more Designated 
Persons, on the other hand, are or may be adverse to each other (each, a "
_Post-Closing Matters_ "), the Designated Persons reasonably anticipate that
Prior Company Counsel will represent them in connection with such matters.
Accordingly,  each of the Purchaser and the Company hereby (i) waives and
shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause its Affiliates to
waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating
to the representation by one or  more Prior Company Counsel of one or more
Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-Closing Matters (the "
_Post-Closing Representations_ "), and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a 
Post-Closing Matter arises, Prior Company Counsel may represent one or more
Designated Persons in Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the  Company Group), and even though Prior Company Counsel may
have represented the Company Group in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Purchaser and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its  Subsidiaries) consents to the disclosure by
Prior Company Counsel, in connection with one or more Post-Closing
Representations, to the Designated Persons of any information learned by Prior
Company Counsel in the course of one or more Existing  Representations,
whether or not such information is subject to the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Prior Company Counsel's duty of
confidentiality as to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and whether or 
not such disclosure is made before or after the Closing.

 


 

 

(b) Each of the Purchaser and the Company (on behalf of itself and its 
Subsidiaries) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to
cause its Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any  communication between any Prior Company
Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Designated Persons_ "), or
any advice given to any Pre-Closing Designated  Person by any Prior Company
Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing Representations (collectively,
" _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute between any 
Designated Person and one or more of the Purchaser, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all
rights to such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all rights to waiver or otherwise
control such  Pre-Closing Privilege, shall be retained by the Seller, and
shall not pass to or be claimed or used by the Purchaser or the Company,
except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 12.18(b)_.
Furthermore, each of the Purchaser and  the Company (on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries) acknowledges and agrees that any advice given to or
communication with any of the Designated Persons shall not be subject to any
joint privilege (whether or not the Company or one more of its  Subsidiaries
also received such advice or communication) and shall be owned solely by such
Designated Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser or any member of the Company Group, on the one 
hand, and a third party other than a Designated Person, on the other hand, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) assert the Pre-Closing
Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to prevent disclosure of
privileged materials  to such third party; provided, however, that such
privilege may be waived only with the prior written consent of the Seller. In
addition, Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing Date, it would be
impractical to remove all attorney-client  communications created prior to
the Closing Date from the records (including e-mails and other electronic
files) of the Company Group. Accordingly, following the Closing, Purchaser
will use commercially reasonable efforts not to and will use  commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each of its Affiliates (including the Company
Group) not to, access or use such attorney-client communication remaining in
the records of the Company Group after the Closing in a manner that would be 
adverse to the Seller or its Affiliates or which would waive attorney-client
privilege.

the Adjustment Factor by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one
or more bank accounts designated in writing by the Seller (which for avoidance
of doubt, may  include payment of a portion of such amount to certain
employees of the Company Group through the Purchaser's payroll system) no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the applicable payment date, and
(ii) subject to Section 2.5(b), issue  to the Seller a number of Purchaser
Shares (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the product of (1) $1,750,000 and (2) the Adjustment Factor by
(B) the  Purchaser Share Price (clause (i) and (ii), collectively, the "
_Prorated Earnout B Amount_ "), minus any amounts offset against payment
obligations of the Seller pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, Section 9.4(e) of the  Purchase and Sale Agreement, on the date that is
five (5) Business Days following the date that the Prorated Earnout B Amount
has become final and binding in accordance with Section 2.3. As used in this
Agreement, the " _Adjustment Factor_ "  shall mean the quotient, rounded to
the nearest whole percentage point, of the Qualifying Growth Amount divided by
$12,400,000 (and, for avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Adjustment
Factor be  equal to or greater than one (1)). For avoidance of doubt, the
Prorated Earnout B Milestone, the Earnout B Milestone or neither (but not
both) may be achieved, the Prorated Earnout B Milestone cannot be achieved
more than once and if the  Prorated Earnout B Milestone would otherwise be
achieved in respect of more than one consecutive twelve (12) calendar month
period in the Earnout B Earnout Period, the Prorated Earnout B Milestone shall
be achieved in respect of such period  that results in the highest Prorated
Earnout B Amount. By way of example, Annex A sets forth certain illustrative
Qualifying Prorated Sales Amounts and, for each Qualifying Prorated Sales
Amount, the Qualifying Growth Amount, Adjustment Factor  and Prorated Earnout
B Amount resulting therefrom.

Section 2.3 _Earnout Statement Dispute Resolution_

 

_ 
  _

 

(a) If the party receiving an Earnout Statement (the " _Receiving Party_ ")
has any objections to any Earnout Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.2,
the Receiving Party shall deliver to the party  that delivered the Earnout
Statement (the " _Delivering Party_ ") a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail each item in dispute, the amount thereof in dispute and the basis for
its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ ").       If (i) the
Receiving Party notifies the Delivering Party in writing of its acceptance of
the Earnout Statement or (ii) an Objections Statement is not delivered to
Delivering Party within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Earnout 
Statement (the " _Objection Period_ "), then the Earnout Statement shall be
final and binding and, if applicable, the Purchaser shall, subject to Section
2.5(b), within five (5) Business Days thereafter, pay the Earnout Amount
identified as  payable (if any) in the applicable Earnout Statement pursuant
to Section 2.1. During the Objection Period, the Receiving Party and its
representatives will have reasonable access during normal business hours to
books and records of the Company  Group and the Purchaser, as applicable, to
the extent relating to the calculation of Company Product Net Sales or Gross
Margin during the relevant period necessary for purposes of their review of
the Earnout Statement. If an Objections  Statement is delivered, then the
Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed
items for thirty (30) days following the Delivering Party's receipt of the
Objections Statement. If, during such period, the Seller  and the Purchaser
are able to resolve such dispute and agree on the Earnout Amount payable
pursuant to the Earnout Statement, such Earnout Amount shall become final and
binding on the parties.

 


 

 

(b) If the Purchaser and the Seller do not reach a final resolution within
thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, either the
Purchaser or the Seller may elect to submit such  dispute to Ernst and Young
LLP or, if Ernst and Young LLP declines to act, another nationally recognized
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Seller (the "
_Independent Accountant_ ") for resolution in accordance  with this Section
2.3(b). The parties agree to instruct the Independent Accountant to render a
determination of the applicable dispute within forty-five (45) days after
referral of the matter to such Independent Accountant, which determination 
must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
therefor. The Independent Accountant shall be bound by this Section 2.3(b) and
shall determine only those issues still in dispute, and the Independent
Accountant may not  assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either the Purchaser or the Seller or less than
the least value for such item claimed by either the Purchaser or the Seller.
The Independent Accountant shall  make its determination (i) based solely on
the documentation submitted by, and presentations made by, the parties (any
such documentation or presentation must be provided to the other parties prior
to its submission or presentation to the  Independent Accountant) and (ii) in
a manner consistent with this Agreement (including the definitions herein).
Absent manifest error, the determination of the Independent Accountant
pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be final and binding  on the parties.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne 50% by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and 50% by the Seller, on the other hand.

this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(iv)

clause (i), not later than the closing date of such transaction, and (y) in
the case of the foregoing clause (iv), on the date of the termination of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay the Liquidated Earnout  Amount in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more bank accounts
designated by the Seller (which for avoidance of doubt, may include payment of
a portion of such amount to certain employees of the Company Group  through
the Purchaser's payroll system), whereupon this Agreement (and all rights and
obligations of the parties hereto) shall terminate (and, for avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay any other Liquidated
Earnout  Amount following such termination).

 


 

 

(b) As used in this Agreement:

 


 

 

(i) " _Company Sale_ " means any transaction or series of transactions
pursuant to which any Person(s), other than the Purchaser or a direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Purchaser, individually or  collectively, acquires
(A) 50% or more of the outstanding equity or voting securities of the Company
or of any of its Subsidiaries representing indirect ownership of more than 50%
of the consolidated assets of the Company Group (whether by  merger,
consolidation, reorganization, combination, sale, transfer or otherwise) or

basis.

 


 

 

(ii) "" _Liquidated Earnout Amount_ " shall mean an amount in cash equal to:

Event occurs on or prior to the Earnout B End Date and neither the Earnout B
Amount nor the Prorated Earnout B  Amount has been paid, $25,000,000 in cash,

110  


 

 

(C) in respect of the Earnout B Milestone, if the applicable Accelerating
Event occurs after the Earnout B End Date and neither the Earnout B Amount nor
the Prorated Earnout B Amount has  been paid, (1) and it has been finally

nor the Prorated Earnout B Milestone has been achieved, then zero ($0) or (2)
and it has not been finally determined in  accordance with Section 2.3 that
the Earnout B Milestone or the Prorated Earnout B Milestone has not been
achieved, then any amounts (if any) payable to the Seller in respect of the
Earnout B Milestone or the Prorated Earnout B Milestone  pursuant to Sections
2.1(b) or 2.1(c), as applicable, in either case, upon final determination in
accordance with Section 2.3, net of any amounts previously offset against any
payment obligations of the Seller pursuant to, and subject to the  terms and
conditions of, Section 9.4(e) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement (without
duplication));

 


 

 

_provided_ that, for avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the sum of the
Liquidated Earnout Amount and the aggregate Earnout Amounts (if any)
previously paid (or previously offset against any payment obligations of the
Seller pursuant  to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section
9.4(e) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement) exceed $50,000,000 (valuing any
Purchaser Shares issued in connection with the satisfaction of the Earnout B
Milestone at $1,750,000 and any  Purchaser Shares issued in connection with
the satisfaction of the Prorated Earnout B Milestone at an amount equal to the
product of $1,750,000 and the Adjustment Factor).

_ 
  _

 

(a) Following the receipt of any Earnout Amount or Liquidated Earnout Amount
pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller shall distribute such amount to the

as a portion of the Earnout B Amount or the Prorated Earnout B Amount shall

Seller to any Person other than to Ken Serota or his designated Affiliate (the

(b) If the Earnout B Milestone or the Prorated Earnout B Milestone is
achieved, then as a condition to the issuance to the Seller of the Purchaser
Shares comprising a portion of the Earnout B Amount or  the Prorated Earnout
B Amount, the Seller and the Earnout B Share Recipient shall execute and
deliver to the Purchaser a representation letter in the form attached hereto
as Annex B (the " _Earnout B Representation Letter_ ").

 


 

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives, successors and assigns from and against any  damages,
losses, liabilities, fines, fees, taxes, costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses related thereto, incurred by any of
them arising out of, relating to or resulting from any distribution or other
transfer  of any portion of any Earnout Amount or Liquidated Earnout Amount
that was not distributed or transferred by the Seller in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

 

111  

Section 2.6 _Certain Seller Acknowledgements_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser each hereby
acknowledge and agree that none of the Purchaser's  covenants and agreements
pursuant to this Article II shall have any force or effect prior to the
Closing and, if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing for any
reason, the Purchaser shall have no obligations hereunder. For avoidance  of
doubt, in no event shall the aggregate amount paid under this Agreement exceed
$50,000,000 (valuing any Purchaser Shares issued in connection with the
satisfaction of the Earnout B Milestone at $1,750,000 and any Purchaser Shares
issued in  connection with the satisfaction of the Prorated Earnout B
Milestone at an amount equal to the product of $1,750,000 and the Adjustment
Factor), net of any amounts previously offset against any payment obligations
of the Seller pursuant to, and  subject to the terms and conditions of,
Section 9.4(e) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

acknowledges and agrees that  (a) the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) act in good faith to cause the business of the Company
Group to be funded and capitalized in a manner materially consistent with, or
more favorable to the Company Group than, the  ordinary course of the Company
Group's business (provided that this clause (i) shall not require the
Purchaser to take any action that is inconsistent with the consolidation and
integration plans of the Purchaser and the Company Group), except  as would
not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of
the Earnout A Milestone or the Earnout B Milestone to be achieved and (ii) not
take any action the primary intent of which is to reduce the Company Product 
Net Sales or Gross Margin and (b) the Purchaser shall maintain (or cause the
Company Group to maintain) financial statements, financial ledgers or other
books and records of the Company Group or otherwise reflecting Company Product
Net Sales,  Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin in the ordinary course and a
manner necessary to calculate Company Product Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold
and Gross Margin in accordance with this Agreement. The Seller hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the  Purchaser shall have no obligation to with
respect to the satisfaction of the Earnout A Milestone, the Earnout B
Milestone or the Prorated Earnout B Milestone except as set forth in this
Section 2.7.

contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation  of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 4.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and  provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon  such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as 
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 


 

 

Section 4.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes
hereto), the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
including the Confidentiality Agreement,  constitute the entire agreement of
the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties or between any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 


 

 

Section 4.6 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation  of Law or otherwise by either
of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other party,
and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and
void; _provided_ , that without written consent of the  Seller, the Purchaser
may assign its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any
of its Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of any
liability or obligation hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ ,  that without
written consent of any party hereto, the Seller may assign its rights
hereunder to receive any portion of any Earnout Amounts payable pursuant to
and in accordance with this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of the
Owners, to  the extent consistent with Section 2.10 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties  hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 


 

 

Section 4.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or  shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

Section 4.9 _Withholding_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and  withheld with respect to such
payment under all applicable Tax Laws. If the Purchaser determines that any
deduction or withholding is required in respect of a payment pursuant to this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall provide written notice to  the Seller no less
than five (5) days prior to the date on which such deduction or withholding is
to be made, and the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate to mitigate any such requirement to the maximum extent  permitted
by Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be (a) treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and 
withholding was made and (b) paid over to the proper Governmental Authority.

 


 

 

Section 4.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the Purchaser and the  Seller.

 


 

 

Section 4.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time, any party hereto entitled to
the benefits thereof, may, to the extent permitted by Law (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations  or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall  be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby. Such extension or waiver shall not be
deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty, or  noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case
may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall  not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 


 

 

Section 4.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the  other parties for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party's  obligations and
to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder.

 


 

 

Section 4.13 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be  construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. The  terms and
conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by the party or parties
entitled to the benefits thereof. Except as otherwise explicitly provided for
elsewhere herein, all rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are 
cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

 


 

 

Section 4.14 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY  CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICTING

expenses of any such arbitration (other than attorneys' fees) shall be borne
50% by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and 50% by the Seller, on the other

Earnout B Representation Letter with Respect to Shares of Common Stock of
Cantel Medical Corp.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

Mr. Serota:

 


 

 

Reference is made to that certain Earnout Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2019
(the " _Earnout_ ___Agreement_ "), by and between Cantel Medical Corp., a 
Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "), and Dental Holding, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used
and not otherwise defined in this letter agreement shall have the meanings set
forth in  the Earnout Agreement. In connection with the achievement of the
Earnout B Milestone or the Prorated B Earnout Milestone, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Earnout Agreement, among other
things, the Purchaser agreed  to issue to the Seller, and the Seller agreed
to distribute to Mr. Ken Serota (the " _Earnout B Share Recipient_ "), certain
shares of the Purchaser's common stock, par value $0.10 per share ("
_Purchaser Shares_ ").

 


 

 

As a condition to your receipt of the applicable number of Purchaser Shares
payable pursuant to the Earnout Agreement as a result of the achievement of
the Earnout B Milestone or the Prorated Earnout B Milestone,  as applicable
(the " _Earnout B Purchaser Shares_ "), and as required by Section 2.5(b) of
the Earnout Agreement, you hereby represent, warrant and agree as follows:

 


 

 

1. You have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that you are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the receipt of the Earnout B Purchaser Shares and of protecting your  interests in connection therewith. You have the ability to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Earnout B Purchaser Shares and can afford to sustain a total loss of that investment.

 


 

 

2. You are acquiring the Earnout B Purchaser Shares for investment for your own account, not as a nominee or agent, and with no current intention or plan to distribute, sell or otherwise dispose of any of  the Earnout B Purchaser Shares in connection with any distribution; _provided_ , _however_ , that in making the representations herein, you reserve the right, subject to this letter agreement, to dispose of your Earnout B Purchaser  Shares at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, in accordance with or pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). You do not presently have any  contract with any person to distribute any of the Earnout B Purchaser Shares. You acknowledge that the Earnout B Purchaser Shares that you are expected to receive have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or  other laws, by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of your investment intent and the accuracy of your representations as expressed in  this letter agreement.

   

3. You have sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as you have considered necessary to make an informed decision with respect to your acquisition of the Earnout B Purchaser Shares. You acknowledge  that neither the Purchaser nor any director, officer, employee, affiliate or representative of the Purchaser has made any representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy, completeness or adequacy of any available information  made available to you.

 


 

 

4. You are an "accredited investor" as that term is defined under Regulation D of the Securities Act.

 


 

 

5. You understand that the Earnout B Purchaser Shares that you are expected to receive are characterized as "restricted securities" under the U.S. federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being  acquired by you from the Purchaser or the Seller (as applicable) in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations and that the such shares may be resold without registration under the  Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. You acknowledge that the Earnout B Purchaser Shares that you are expected to receive must be held indefinitely unless a sale of such shares is subsequently registered under the Securities  Act or an exemption from such registration is available. You are aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement or shares owned by certain Persons  associated with the Purchaser subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

 


 

 

6. You understand and agree that each certificate representing the Earnout B Purchaser Shares that you are expected to receive shall bear a legend in the following form (in addition to any other legend  required under applicable state securities laws) (and agree that if such shares are not in certificated form, other appropriate restrictions shall be implemented to give effect to the following):

 


 

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THEY MAY  NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH
ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OR
AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH  ACT AND SUCH LAWS. THE ISSUER
OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH
THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF  ANY STATE OR OTHER
JURISDICTION.

   

You agree that subject to the terms of this letter agreement, upon the sale of
your Earnout B Purchaser Shares either pursuant to a registration statement or
upon your satisfaction of the relevant holding period under Rule 144, and at
your  request, you and the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other to exchange your certificates for such relevant
shares for new certificates not bearing a legend restricting transfer under
the Securities Act, and  you shall provide such certificates, documents
and/or legal opinions as the Purchaser and the Purchaser's registrar and
transfer agent may reasonably request in connection therewith.

 


 

 

7. Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (b) five  (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (c) one (1) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next business day delivery, with  written verification of receipt. All notices and other communications shall be sent to the applicable party at the address listed on the first page of this letter agreement or at such other address as a party may designate by ten (10) days'  advance written notice to the other parties hereto.

or materially delay its ability to pursue or consummate such transaction, (ii)
the Purchaser determines in good faith that the filing or amendment of a

connection with any underwritten offering have received copies of a
supplemented or  amended prospectus prepared and filed by the Purchaser, or
until such Selling Holders and underwriters are advised in writing by the
Purchaser that the current prospectus or supplement thereto may be used. In
the event of any Suspension, subject  to _Section 4.2(a)_ , the Purchaser
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the availability for use of the

reasonably possible after delivery of the notification  contemplated by

such Holder's  request, such Holder and the Purchaser shall use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with each other to exchange such Holder's
certificates for such Eligible Securities for new certificates in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Seller and not  bearing a legend restricting
transfer under the Securities Act. Such Holder of Eligible Securities shall

and the Purchaser's registrar and transfer agent may reasonably  request in
connection with this _Section 4.4_.

the Securities Act against any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities, joint or several, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or
threatened) in respect thereof, to which each such indemnified party may
become subject  under the Securities Act or otherwise insofar as such losses,
claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any registration statement contemplated hereby under which Eligible Securities
were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained  therein, any Free Writing
Prospectus or any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433 of the Act)
filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission  to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein (in the case of a preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made)  not misleading, but only to the extent that such statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and, in conformity with, written
information furnished by or on behalf of such Selling Holder to the Purchaser
expressly for use therein. In no  event shall the aggregate amounts payable
by any Selling Holder by way of indemnity or contribution under this _Article
VI_ exceed the net proceeds from the related offering received by such Selling
Holder.

 

 

13  

(c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party hereunder of  notice of
the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this _Section 6.1_ , the indemnified party will
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but
the  omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified
party under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this _Section 6.1_ (except to the extent
that it has been  prejudiced by such failure). In case any such action, suit,
claim or proceeding is brought against any indemnified party, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent it may elect
by written notice delivered  to the indemnified party within thirty (30) days
after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party (at its sole cost). Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the indemnified
party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified
party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have  been authorized
in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such
suit, action, claim or proceeding or(ii) the indemnifying party shall have
failed to assume the defense of such action, suit, claim or proceeding within
a  reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, suit, claim or
proceeding or . If any of the events specified in clauses (i) or(ii) of the
preceding sentence shall have occurred or shall otherwise be applicable, then
the reasonable  fees and expenses of one counsel (plus local counsel as
reasonably required) selected by a majority in interest of the indemnified
parties shall be borne by the indemnifying party. If, in any case specified in
the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii),  the indemnified party employs separate
counsel(s), the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the
defense of such action, suit, claim or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified
party. Anything in this paragraph to the contrary  notwithstanding, an
indemnifying party shall not be liable for the settlement of any action, suit,
claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent (which consent
in the case of an action, suit, claim or proceeding exclusively  seeking
monetary relief shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the relevant
indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action,
suit,  claim or proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a
party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such indemnified party,
unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability  on claims that are or could have been
the subject matter of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not
include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure
to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party.   Such indemnification
shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of any investigation made
by or on behalf of an indemnified party.

 


 

 

(d) If for any reason the indemnity under this _Section 6.1_   is unavailable
or is insufficient to hold harmless any indemnified party under paragraphs (a)
or (b) of this _Section 6.1_ , then the indemnifying parties shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable to the indemnified party as a result of  any
loss, claim, expense, damage or liability (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof), and legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by the indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending  any such loss, claim, expense, damage, liability, action or
proceeding, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the
other. The relative fault shall  be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Purchaser or the Selling  Holder and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such untrue statement or omission. If, however, the allocation
provided in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by  applicable law
or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount herein
before calculated, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate
to  reflect not only such relative fault but also the relative benefits of
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
and equitable if  contributions pursuant to this paragraph (d) of _Section
6.1_ were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the preceding  sentences of this paragraph (d) of _Section
6.1_. Notwithstanding the anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each
Holder shall not be required to contribute an amount greater than the net
proceeds received by such Holder from the sale  of Eligible Securities
pursuant to the registration statement to which claims relate.

 

 

14  

(e) All legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by or on  behalf of any
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any loss,
claim, expense, damage, liability, action or proceeding which are to be borne
by the indemnifying party pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall be paid by 
the indemnifying party in advance of the final disposition of such
investigation, defense, action or proceeding within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by the indemnifying party of a statement or statements from the
indemnified party requesting  from time to time such payment, advance or
advances. The entitlement of each indemnified party to such payment or
advancement of expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any
action or proceeding by the indemnified party seeking  an adjudication or
award in arbitration pursuant to this _Section 6.1_. Such statement or
statements shall reasonably evidence such expenses incurred by the indemnified
party in connection therewith.

 


 

 

(f) (i) In the event that advances are not made  pursuant to this _Section
6.1_ or payment has not otherwise been timely made, each indemnified party
shall be entitled to seek a final adjudication in an appropriate court of
competent jurisdiction of the entitlement of the indemnified  party to
indemnification or advances hereunder.

 


 

 

(ii) The Purchaser and the Selling Holders  agree that they shall be
precluded from asserting that the procedures and presumptions of this _Section
6.1_ are not valid, binding and enforceable. The Purchaser and the Selling
Holders further agree to stipulate in any such court that  the Purchaser and
the Selling Holders are bound by all the provisions of this _Section 6.1_ and
are precluded from making any assertion to the contrary.

 


 

 

(g) In the event that any indemnified party is a party to or  intervenes in
any proceeding to which the validity or enforceability of this _Section 6.1_
is at issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce the rights of any indemnified
party under, or to recover damages for breach of, this _Section 6.1_ ,  the
indemnified party, if the indemnified party prevails in whole in such action,
shall be entitled to recover from the indemnifying party and shall be
indemnified by the indemnifying party against, any expenses reasonably
incurred by the  indemnified party. If it is determined that the indemnified
party is entitled to indemnification for part (but not all) of the
indemnification so requested, expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of such
partial indemnification shall be  reasonably prorated among the claims,
issues or matters for which the indemnified party is entitled to
indemnification and for such claims, issues or matters for which the
indemnified party is not so entitled.

 

 

15  

(h) The indemnity agreements contained in this _Section 6.1_   shall be in
addition to any other rights (to indemnification, contribution or otherwise)
which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made  or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive
the transfer of any Eligible Securities by any Holder.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 


 

 

Reference is made to that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of
July 29, 2019 (the " _Purchase and Sale_ ___Agreement_ "), by  and among
Cantel Medical Corp., a Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "), Dental
Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Seller_ "), Hu-
Friedy Mfg. Co., LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_
"),     and (for limited purposes set forth therein) Ken Serota and Ron
Saslow. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase
and Sale Agreement, the Seller agreed to sell to Purchaser, and the Purchaser
agreed to purchase from  the Seller, all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests in the Company in exchange for consideration payable by
the Seller consisting, among other things, of shares of the Purchaser's common
stock, par value $0.10 per share (" _Purchaser     Shares_ ").

 


 

 

The Purchase and Sale Agreement permits the Seller to assign the right to
receive or transfer Purchaser Shares issued as consideration pursuant to the
Purchase and Sale Agreement (such shares,  the " _Closing Stock
Consideration_ ") to certain "Permitted Transferees" specified on a schedule
to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. We understand that you are such a
Permitted Transferee and that the Seller designs to transfer, or assign  the
right to receive, to you a portion of the Closing Stock Consideration
consisting of [●] Purchaser Shares.

 


 

 

As a condition to your acquisition of such portion of the Closing Stock
Consideration, and as required by Section 7.10 of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, you hereby represent, warrant and  agree as follows:

 


 

 

1. You have a received from the Purchaser a true and complete copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and have read and understand its terms, including Section 7.10 thereof. You are a  "Permitted Transferee" for purposes of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. You are acquiring Purchaser Shares subject to, and agree to be bound by and comply in all respects with, the terms and conditions applicable to the Closing Stock  Consideration set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement (including the transfer restrictions set forth therein). All shares of the Closing Stock Consideration that you are expected to receive shall constitute Locked-Up Purchaser Shares (as  defined in Section 7.10 the Purchase and Sale Agreement).

   


 

 

2. You have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that you are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the receipt of the Purchaser Shares and of  protecting your interests in connection therewith. You have the ability to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Purchaser Shares and can afford to sustain a total loss of that investment.

 


 

 

3. You are acquiring the Purchaser Shares for investment for your own account, not as a nominee or agent, and with no current intention or plan to distribute, sell or otherwise dispose  of any of the Purchaser Shares in connection with any distribution; _provided_ , _however_ , that in making the representations herein, you reserve the right, subject to Section 7.10 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to dispose of  your Purchaser Shares at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, in accordance with or pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption under the Securities Act. You do not presently have any contract with any person to  distribute any of the Purchaser Shares. You acknowledge that the shares of the Closing Stock Consideration that you are expected to receive have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or other laws, by reason of a  specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of your investment intent and the accuracy of your representations as expressed in this letter agreement.

 


 

 

4. You have sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as you have considered necessary to make an informed decision with respect to your acquisition of the Purchaser Shares. You  acknowledge that neither the Purchaser nor any director, officer, employee, affiliate or representative of the Purchaser has made any representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy, completeness or adequacy of any available  information made available to you.

 


 

 

5. [You are an "accredited investor" as that term is defined under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.]

 


 

 

6. You understand that the shares of the Closing Stock Consideration that you are expected to receive are characterized as "restricted securities" under the U.S. federal securities  laws inasmuch as they are being acquired by you from the Purchaser or the Seller (as applicable) in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations and that the such shares may be resold without  registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. You acknowledge that the shares of the Closing Stock Consideration that you are expected to receive must be held indefinitely unless a sale of such shares is  subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. You are aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit limited resale of shares purchased in a private  placement or shares owned by certain Persons associated with the Purchaser subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

 


 

 

7. You understand and agree that each certificate representing the shares of the Closing Stock Consideration that you are expected to receive shall bear a legend in the following form  (in addition to any other legend required under applicable state securities laws) (and agree that if such shares are not in certificated form, other appropriate restrictions shall be implemented to give effect to the following): 
 

   

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THEY MAY  NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH
ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OR
AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH  ACT AND SUCH LAWS. THE ISSUER
OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH
THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF  ANY STATE OR OTHER
JURISDICTION.

 


 

 

You agree that subject to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, upon
the sale of your shares of the Closing Stock Consideration either pursuant to
a registration statement or upon your satisfaction of the  relevant holding
period under Rule 144, and at your request, you and the Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other to exchange your
certificates for such relevant shares for new certificates not bearing a
legend  restricting transfer under the Securities Act, and you shall provide
such certificates, documents and/or legal opinions as Purchaser and the
Purchaser's registrar and transfer agent may reasonably request in connection
therewith.

 


 

 

8. Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery to the party to  be notified, (b) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (c) one (1) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next business  day delivery, with written verification of receipt. All notices and other communications shall be sent to the applicable party at the address listed on the signature page hereof or at such other address as a party may designate by ten (10)  days' advance written notice to the other parties hereto.

_FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT_

 


 

 

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
_______, 2019, by and among Cantel Medical Corp., a Delaware corporation, (the
" _Purchaser_ "), Dental Holding,  LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _Seller_ " and together with Purchaser, sometimes referred to
individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ") and
Citibank, N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ").      Capitalized
terms not defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them
in that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2019 (as
amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Purchase Agreement_
")  by and among Purchaser, Seller, Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co., LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, Ken Serota, an individual (solely for purposes of
Section 7.15 of the Purchase Agreement) and Ron Saslow, an individual (solely
for purposes of Section  7.15 of the Purchase Agreement).

 


 

 

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement contemplates the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and (i) the deposit by Purchaser with the Escrow Agent of
$[●]  (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") in accordance with Section 2.7(ii)
of the Purchase Agreement in order to secure indemnification obligations of
the Seller (if any), and (ii) the deposit by Purchaser with the Escrow Agent
of $[●] (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ " and together with the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Amounts_ ") in accordance with Section 2.7(ii) of
the Purchase Agreement in order to secure  post-closing adjustment payment
obligations of the Seller (if any), each as described in the Purchase
Agreement. The Parties wish such deposits to be subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein and set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

 


 

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 


 

 

1. _Appointment_. The Parties each hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and  agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 


 

 

2. _Escrow Funds_.

 


 

 

(a) Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Purchaser is depositing with the Escrow Agent (i) the Indemnity Escrow Amount
and (ii) the Adjustment Escrow  Amount. The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges
receipt of the Escrow Amounts and shall hold (i) the Indemnity Escrow Amount
in a separate escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), and (ii)
the Adjustment Escrow Amount in a separate  escrow account (the " _Adjustment
Escrow Account_ " and together with the Indemnity Escrow Account, the "
_Escrow Accounts_ "). The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Amounts, together
with all products and proceeds thereof, including all  interest, dividends,
gains and other income (collectively, the " _Escrow Earnings_ ") earned with
respect thereto (collectively, the " _Escrow Funds_ ") subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent agrees that the  Escrow
Accounts shall at all times be segregated from other property held by the
Escrow Agent and shall be identified as being held in connection with this
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.

     

(b) For greater certainty, all Escrow Earnings shall (i) be retained by the
Escrow Agent and reinvested in the Escrow Funds, (ii) become part of the
Escrow Funds and (iii) be disbursed  as part of the Escrow Funds in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 


 

 

3. _Investment of Escrow Funds_.

 


 

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for any investment losses
resulting from the investment, reinvestment or liquidation of the escrowed
property, as applicable, provided  that the Escrow Agent has made such
investment, reinvestment or liquidation of the escrowed property in accordance
with the terms, and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent does not have a duty nor will it undertake any  duty to provide
investment advice.

 


 

 

(b) Unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Parties, the Escrow Agent
shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Funds in an interest-bearing deposit
obligation of Citibank N.A., with an  initial rate of XXbps (0.XX%), insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ ") to the applicable
limits. The Parties acknowledge that the initial interest rate is subject to
change from time to time and shall be reflected in  the monthly statement
provided to the Parties. The Escrow Funds shall at all times remain available
for distribution in accordance with _Section 4_ below.

 


 

 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of the Parties on

Agent will act on such Final Determination  without further inquiry.

 


 

 

(iii) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , (A)
the Parties agree to deliver to the Escrow Agent, from time to time within
three (3) Business Days  after the determination of any of the Actual Working

hereto (the " _Call Back Authorized Individuals_ "), and the Escrow Agent may
rely upon the confirmations of anyone reached at a telephone number set forth
in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2 purporting to be the Call Back  Authorized
Individual associated with such telephone number. To assure accuracy of the
instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such call backs. If the
Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions, or is not satisfied with
the  verification it receives, it will not execute the instruction until all
such issues have been resolved. The persons and telephone numbers for call
backs may be changed only in writing, executed by an authorized signer of

5. _Escrow Agent_.

 


 

 

(a) The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly
set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and
shall under no circumstance be  deemed a fiduciary for any of the Parties to
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor
chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the
terms and conditions of any other agreement,  instrument or document between
the Parties (other than a Joint Release Instruction or Final Determination),
in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the Purchase
Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine  if any Person
has complied with any such agreements (other than a Joint Release Instruction
or Final Determination), nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow
Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference 
thereto may be made in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any other
agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(which includes any cross-references to the Purchase Agreement) will control
the actions of  the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall
not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any Joint Release
Instruction or Final Determination furnished to it hereunder and believed by
it to be genuine and to have been  signed and presented by an authorized
signer of the proper Parties. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement,
the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers' forms in the
form of _Exhibit A ‑1_ and _Exhibit A ‑2_  attached hereto. The Escrow Agent
shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy
or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow
Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which  may be due it or the
Escrow Funds. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its
duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands
from any Party which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the  provisions of
this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its
sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it
shall be directed otherwise in a Joint Release Instruction or Final 
Determination. The Escrow Agent may interplead all of the assets held
hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory
judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully
relieved from any and all  liability or obligation with respect to such
interpleaded assets or any action or nonaction based on such declaratory
judgment. The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its selection in
the event of any dispute or question as to the  meaning or construction of
any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent will
not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
good faith except to the extent that the Escrow Agent's fraud,  willful
misconduct or gross negligence was the cause of any loss to either Party. To
the extent practicable, the Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute (other than with respect to a dispute involving
the  Escrow Agent) without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall
the Escrow Agent be liable for any special, indirect, punitive, incidental or
consequential losses  or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such losses or damages and regardless of the form of action.

 

 

4  

6. _Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent (a) may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) calendar days advance  notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect or (b) may be removed, with or without cause, by the Purchaser and the Seller acting jointly at any time by providing written notice to  the Escrow Agent. Any corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the escrow business of the  Escrow Agent's line of business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires or after receipt of written notice of  removal shall be to hold and safeguard the Escrow Funds (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same (i) to a substitute or successor escrow agent pursuant to a joint written designation from the Parties, (ii) as set  forth in a Joint Release Instruction or (iii) in accordance with the directions of a Final Determination, at which time of delivery the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. In the event the Escrow Agent resigns, if the  Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of  such a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto.

 


 

 

7. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are described in _Schedule 1_ attached hereto and shall be paid by the Purchaser. The fees agreed upon for  the services to be rendered hereunder are intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agent services as contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

8. _Indemnity_. Each of the Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns,  directors, officers, agents and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses  (including the reasonable fees and expenses of one outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively " _Escrow Agent Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with (a)  the Escrow Agent's execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the  Indemnitee, except to the extent that such Escrow Agent Losses, as adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, have been caused by the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Escrow Agent or any such Indemnitee, or (b) its  following any instructions or other directions from the Seller or Purchaser, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a lien  on, right of set‑off against and security interest in, the Escrow Funds for the payment of any reasonable claim for indemnification, expenses and amounts due hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent is expressly authorized  and directed, but shall not be obligated, upon prior written notice to the Parties, to charge against and withdraw from the Escrow Funds for its own account or for the account of an indemnitee any amounts due to the Escrow Agent or to an  indemnitee under this _Section 8_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree, solely as between themselves, that any obligation for indemnification under this _Section_ _8_ (or for reasonable fees and  expenses of the Escrow Agent described in _Section 7_ ) shall be borne by the Party or Parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing the Escrow Agent Loss against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to  indemnification or, if no such determination is made, then one‑half by Purchaser and one‑half by Seller. The provisions of this _Section 8_ shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

 

 

5  

9. _Tax Matters._

 


 

 

(a) To the extent that any interest or other income is earned with respect to
the Escrow Funds, the Parties agree that such interest or other income shall
be treated as having been  earned by Seller and reported as and to the extent
required by law, by the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing
authority, on IRS Form 1099 (or other appropriate form) as income earned from
the Escrow Funds by the Seller, whether or not  such income has been
distributed during such year. The Seller shall be responsible for and the
taxpayer on all taxes due on the interest or income earned, if any, on the
Escrow Funds for the calendar year in which such interest or income is 
earned. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, within three (3)
Business Days following the end of each calendar quarter during the term of
this Agreement and immediately prior to the final release of the funds in each
of the Escrow  Account pursuant to Section 4 hereof (the date of such
release, the "Final Distribution Date"), the Escrow Agent shall automatically
distribute an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the interest or other
income earned on the Escrow Funds  during such calendar quarter (or the
period beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter that includes the
Final Distribution Date and ending on the Final Distribution Date) to Seller
in accordance with such written payment instructions  provided to the Escrow
Agent by an authorized signatory for Seller. A properly completed IRS Form W-9
for each of the Parties shall be provided to the Escrow Agent prior to
execution of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) The Parties each acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Agent be
responsible only for interest reporting to the Internal Revenue Service and
other applicable tax authorities with  respect to income earned on the Escrow
Funds. The Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes required to be withheld by
applicable law, including but not limited to required withholding in the
absence of proper tax documentation, and shall remit such  taxes to the
appropriate authorities.

 

 

6  

(c) The Escrow Agent, its affiliates, and its employees are not in the
business of providing tax advice to any taxpayer outside of Citigroup, Inc.
and its affiliates. This Agreement and  any amendments or attachments hereto
are not intended or written to be used, and may not be used or relied upon, by
any such taxpayer or for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Any such
taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's  particular circumstances
from an independent tax advisor.

 


 

 

10. _Covenant of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees and covenants with the Purchaser and the Seller that it shall perform all of its obligations under this Agreement  and shall not deliver custody or possession of any portion of the Escrow Funds to anyone except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law.

 


 

 

11. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications to be given or delivered to Purchaser, Seller or the Escrow Agent under or by reason of the provisions of  this Agreement shall be in writing, in English, and shall be deemed to have been given (a) upon receipt, if delivered personally, (b) three (3) days after being mailed by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to  the parties hereto at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party hereto as shall be specified by like changes of address) or (c) immediately when sent by email (so long as confirmation of transmission is electronically or  mechanically generated and kept on file by the sending party hereto) to the email address specified below (or at such other email address for a party hereto as shall be specified by like changes of email addresses):

13. _Miscellaneous._ The provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by all of the parties hereto.   Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by any party hereto, except as provided in _Sections 6_ and _16_ , without the prior consent of the other parties hereto.

All signatures of the  parties hereto to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or electronic transmission in portable document format (.pdf), and such facsimile or .pdf will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose  signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party.

The Parties represent, warrant and covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to the Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and  regulations. Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such applicable law may be waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this Agreement shall be enforced  as written. Except as expressly provided in _Sections 8_ , nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and the Parties any legal or equitable right,  remedy, interest or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any funds escrowed hereunder.

15. _Further Assurances_.

Any transfer or assignment of the  rights, interests or obligations hereunder in violation of the terms hereof shall be void and of no force or effect.

9

_Illustrative Tax Gross-Up Calculations_

 

 


 

 

Set forth below are two example calculations of the payment owed by Purchaser
to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_ of the Agreement. The Tax rates and
other figures set forth below  are for illustrative purposes only, and are
not intended to reflect the true values of such inputs. To the extent of any
inconsistencies between this _Exhibit E_ and the Agreement, the Agreement
shall control.

 


 

 

_Assumptions and Inputs Applicable to Both Calculations_

Excess Share Value

    |

In both examples, the Closing Date occurs in 2019, the Post-Closing Offering
occurs in 2020 and, other than Earnout A (as defined in the Earnout
Agreement), there are no payments in 2020 that  affect the calculation of
Other Payments in such year.

 


 

 

_Example 1 - Earnout A of $25 million paid in 2020_

 


 

 

 

       
    | •  |  

Other Payments for 2020 = $25 million

Aggregate Post-Closing Offering Proceeds ($35 million)

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | o  |  

_minus_ Excess Share Value ($25 million) = $10 million

_minus_ Excess Share Tax Value ($30 million)

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | o  |  

_minus_ $0, which is the excess of (1) the amount that Seller pays Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.11(a) ($10 million) _over_ (2) the Other Payments for
2020 ($25  million)

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | o  |  

_plus_ $0 (since Other Payments are greater than $0)

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

       
    | o  |  

= $5 million

    
---|---|---

(17%),

Capital Gains Rate (20%)
