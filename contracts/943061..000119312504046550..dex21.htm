iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 20, 2004 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made and entered into by and among OILER HOLDING COMPANY,
a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), OILER ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware
corporation (" _Acquisition_ "), and US ONCOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "). 



RECITALS



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and
the Company (in the case of the Company acting on the recommendation of a
special committee (the " _Special Committee_ ") formed for the purpose of
representing the Company in connection with the possible transactions
contemplated hereby and any alternatives thereto) has deemed it advisable and
in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Acquisition to
merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to Section 251 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company
has each adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and



WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 



AGREEMENT



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). At
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the
name "US Oncology, Inc." and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and
obligations of the Company and Acquisition in accordance with the DGCL. As
the context requires, the Company is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_."



1.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the Merger
shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, the consummation of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as promptly as practical following
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law (as hereinafter
defined)) of all of the conditions (other than those conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) set forth in Article VI (and, in
any event, not more than two business days following the satisfaction or
waiver of all such conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of
Ropes and Gray, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10111, unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.



1.3 _Effective Time of the Merger_. At Closing, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon such
filing or at such time thereafter as Parent, Acquisition and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").



1.4 _Effects of the Merger_.

 



(a) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.



(b) The directors of Acquisition and the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.



(c) Effective upon and as part of the Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to be the same as the
Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than provisions relating to the name, incorporator
and registered agent of the Company, indemnification and advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liability, which shall not be amended) and, as
so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with
its terms and the DGCL.



 

(d) The Company shall take all required corporate action so that the Bylaws of
Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger (other than
provisions relating to indemnification and advancement of expenses, which
shall not be amended) until thereafter amended in accordance with the
DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.



ARTICLE II



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES

OF THE COMPANY AND ACQUISITION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") or Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "):



(a) _Common Stock of Acquisition_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of Acquisition (the " _Acquisition Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding



 

2 immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Company Common Stock Owned by Parent
or Acquisition_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent
or Acquisition or held in the treasury of the Company (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.



(c)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive in cash from the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger an amount equal to $15.05 (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").



 

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who was
entitled to and has validly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL but instead shall be converted
into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL. If any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, each share of such holder shall be treated as a share of Company
Common Stock that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
settle, offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



(e) _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares) that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any shares of Company Common Stock being converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
(the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive a cash amount
equal to the Merger Consideration per share multiplied by the number of shares
so represented, to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b).



(f) _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time,
solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or stock
distribution which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all
holders of Company Common Stock, there is a change in the number of





 

3 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates. At the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of such
Certificates, for use in the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II, the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash
consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving
Corporation given on the Closing Date, make payments of the Merger
Consideration out of the Merger Fund. The Merger Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or deliver to each Person (as
hereinafter defined) who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Company Common Stock and whose shares are being converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions
as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) containing instructions
for use by holders of Company Common Stock to effect the exchange of their
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as provided
herein. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of an
outstanding Certificate or Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of such Certificate or Certificates and such letter of transmittal duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto (together
with such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) and
acceptance thereof by the Paying Agent (or, if such shares are held in book-
entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry
transfer agent of the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock on a
book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein
to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)), be
entitled to an amount of cash (payable by check) equal to the Merger
Consideration per share multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If cash is to be
remitted to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition
of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), at any time after the Effective Time,
each Certificate shall be deemed to represent only





 

4 the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such surrender as
contemplated by Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable as Merger Consideration.



(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock Exchanged for Cash_.
All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock exchanged for
cash theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(d) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to
escheat and abandoned property and similar Laws.



(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Merger
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.



(f) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Merger Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement.



2.3 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options and Delayed Delivery
Agreements_. (a) A list showing (i) each of the Companys stock option plans,
programs and



 

5 arrangements (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ") and outstanding options to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock under the Stock Plans (the " _Company
Stock Options_ "), including the name of the Stock Plan under which such
options were issued, the holders thereof, the number of shares subject
thereto, the exercise prices thereof, the dates of scheduled vesting thereof
and the terms thereof that require acceleration of such vesting by virtue of
the Merger, and (ii) all of the Companys delayed delivery agreements with
physicians (" _Delayed Delivery Agreements_ "), including the names of all
physicians with rights thereunder (" _Physician Recipients_ "), the dates and
conditions, if any, of scheduled issuances thereunder, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto and any terms thereof that require
acceleration of such scheduled issuances by virtue of the Merger, is set forth
on _Schedule 2.3(a)_.



(b) At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee administering the Stock Plans shall take
all actions necessary, and obtain all consents necessary, so that all
outstanding Company Stock Options heretofore granted under any Stock Plan
shall become fully vested and exercisable at the Effective Time and shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment by the
Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the
per share Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock
Option shall not theretofore have been exercised. Reasonably promptly after
the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of
Company Stock Options the cash payments specified in this Section 2.3(b).



(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all actions necessary, and obtain all consents necessary, so that all
outstanding rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock under the Delayed
Delivery Agreements shall be cancelled and such Delayed Delivery Agreements
will evidence only the right to receive at the Effective Time cash payments by
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, of an amount equal to (i) the per
share Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that had been otherwise issuable under such Delayed Delivery
Agreement on such scheduled dates. Reasonably promptly after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Persons entitled to payments
under the Delayed Delivery Agreements the cash payments specified in this
Section 2.3(c).



(d) The Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the
provisions in any other agreement, arrangement or benefit plan providing for
the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any
interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of
the Effective Time, and the Company shall take such actions to ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option or any
participant in or a party to any Stock Plan or other agreement, arrangement or
benefit plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock or
any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(e) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holder of
Company Stock Options or the Physician Recipients under the Delayed Delivery
Agreements such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts





 

6 shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Stock Options or Physician Recipient under any Delayed
Delivery Agreement, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.



ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition as follows:



(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation, partnership or a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation,
partnership or limited liability company and in good standing to conduct
business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the
operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
so qualify or be licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership
or limited liability company or to be in good standing has not had and
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent and Acquisition complete and correct copies of the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational documents)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of or default under the provisions of any such
organizational documents. Each jurisdiction in which the Company is qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation is set forth on _Schedule 3.1(a)_. As
used in this Agreement, (i) " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean
(A) a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ , that "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall not be deemed to
include a material adverse effect arising directly as a result of (1)
conditions, events or circumstances (other than changes or proposed changes
in (A) Laws and (B) pricing or reimbursement by any commercial entities (other
than governmental payors)) affecting either (x) the United States economy
generally or (y) the cancer care services industry generally, which in the
case of clause (x) and (y) does not have a materially disproportionate effect
on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) changes or
proposed changes in Laws that result in changes in reimbursement by
governmental payors (it being understood that any change or proposal of a
change in pricing or reimbursement by any commercial entities (other than
governmental payors) that has a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be a
Company Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes
of analyzing whether any event, change, condition, circumstance or state of
facts constitutes a "Company Material Adverse Effect" under this definition,
the parties agree that the analysis of materiality shall not be limited to
either a long-term or short-term perspective, (ii)



 

7 " _Subsidiary_ " shall mean, with respect to any party, any Person (A) of
which such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner,
(B) of which voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
others performing similar functions with respect to such Person is held by
such party or by one or more of its Subsidiaries or (C) of which at least 50%
of the equity interests (or economic equivalent) of such Person are, directly
or indirectly, owned or controlled by such party or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) "Person" shall mean any natural person, firm,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, business trust, trust,
association, corporation, company, unincorporated entity or other entity.



(b) _Capital Structure_.



(i) _The Company_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
252,000,000 shares of stock of which (A) 250,000,000 shares are Company
Common Stock and (B) 2,000,000 shares are Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "), of which 500,000 shares are designated as
Series A Preferred Stock. As of the close of business on March 19, 2004 (the
" _Capitalization Date_ "), 85,348,766 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding; no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; 9,952,036 shares of Company Common Stock were held in the
Companys treasury; 12,628,098 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved
for issuance pursuant to the outstanding Company Stock Options; 925,570 shares
of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance under Delayed Delivery
Agreements; and there were outstanding rights (" _Rights_ ") with respect to

Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnitees_ ") as provided in their respective charters
and/or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) or in any indemnification
agreement listed on _Schedule 5.5(a)_ shall survive the Merger and, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such Indemnitees, unless an alteration
or modification of such documents is required by applicable Law or each
Indemnitee affected thereby otherwise consents in writing thereto.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain officers and directors liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent available (" _D andO Insurance_") covering
Indemnitees who are currently covered by the Companys existing officers and
directors or fiduciary liability insurance policies on terms no less
advantageous in the aggregate to such indemnified parties than such
existing insurance (copies of which policies have been made available to
Parent and Acquisition); _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not
be required to pay an annual premium therefor in excess of 250% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, which the Company represents
and warrants to be $897,815 (the " _Current Premium_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium on an annualized basis not in
excess of 250% of the Current Premium.

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person

then existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries identified by
Parent and/or to exercise its purchase option under its end loaded lease
facility; _provided_ in each case that such call or any agreement to repay,
redeem, exercise and/or renegotiate may be rescinded if the Merger is not
completed on or prior to the effective date of any such prepayment, repayment,
redemption, exercise and/or renegotiation, as the case may be, and,

any such press release or make any such public announcement prior to such

respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such parties will
use their reasonable best efforts to make such filings promptly and to respond
on a timely basis to any requests for additional information made by either
of such agencies. Each of the parties hereto agrees to furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity or members or their respective
staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the Merger, other than personal
financial information filed therewith.

any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Acquisition or the Company or any of their
respective affiliates in connection with the Merger or the taking of any other
action contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable

may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
filings, registrations or submissions of information to any Governmental
Entities, including any filings necessary under the provisions of the HSR Act.



(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors
shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all action
necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or Acquisition to exempt
the Merger from the provisions of any applicable takeover, business
combination, control share acquisition or similar Law and (ii) if any
takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or similar Law
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, use their reasonable best
efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger.

Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) notice or
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of

been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.1. The Company
shall provide bi-weekly written updates to Parent on an aggregated basis
regarding the status of negotiations between the Company, its Subsidiaries or

commercial entities, on the other hand, relating to the pricing for drugs or
other pharmaceutical products for purposes of reimbursement. The delivery of

party or parties receiving such notice.

Subsidiaries or group of such officers, directors, employees or consultants
that are set forth on _Schedule 5.10(a)_.

Subsidiaries on the date hereof (other than modifications to any employee
benefit plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice

or its Subsidiaries shall be given credit for all service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries)

any Person referenced in this Section 5.10, each of whom may enforce
the provisions of this Section 5.10 whether or not parties to this



 

41 Agreement. Except as provided in paragraph (a) above, nothing contained in
this Section 5.10 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any

any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation with respect to continued
employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever.



5.11 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Special Meeting_.

written comments from the SEC and (ii) any request by the SEC for any

requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the SEC
(provided that the Company shall (i) include in any such documents or
responses all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (ii) not file, mail
or otherwise deliver such document or respond to the SEC or the staff of the
SEC over Parents reasonable objection), prior to filing such with or sending

of all such filings made and correspondence with the SEC. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any party
hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 so that the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3 would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and
disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company.



(b) The Company shall, acting through its Board of Directors and in accordance
with applicable Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of
the Company, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of

Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company) for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger and, subject
to Section 5.2(d), shall solicit proxies in favor of approval of this
Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Board of Directors
of the Company shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger by

obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.11(b) shall not
be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) an
Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company
properly exercises its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section

Section 5.11(b) shall terminate.



5.12 _Consequences If Rights Are Triggered_. If any Distribution Date (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) or Shares Acquisition Date (as defined in the
Rights Agreement) occurs under the Rights Agreement at any time during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time other than as a
result of the actions of Parent, Acquisition or their respective affiliates,
the Company, Parent and Acquisition shall make such adjustment to the per
share Merger Consideration (without any increase in the aggregate Merger
Consideration) as the Company, Parent and Acquisition shall mutually agree so
as to preserve the economic benefits that the parties each reasonably expected
on the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of
the Merger.



5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.



5.14 _Debt Tender Offer_. (a) At such time as requested by Parent and
Acquisition (provided that Parent and Acquisition shall coordinate with
the Company regarding such timing), the Company shall (i) commence a cash
tender offer to purchase all of the Companys outstanding 9-5/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the " _Senior Subordinated Notes_ ") and (ii)
solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes regarding
the amendments (the " _Indenture Amendments_ ") described on _Schedule 5.14_
hereto to the covenants contained in the Indenture, dated as of February 1,
2002, among the Company, certain Subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors,
and JP Morgan Chase Bank, as trustee. Such offer to purchase and consent
solicitation (the " _Debt Offer_ ") shall be made on such terms and conditions
as are described on  _Schedule 5.14_ and such other terms and conditions
agreed to by Parent and Acquisition; _provided_ , that, in any event, the
parties agree that the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer shall provide
that the closing thereof shall be contingent upon the closing of the Merger.
The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer and make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and Acquisition, and the Company shall not,
without Parents and Acquisitions prior consent, waive any condition to the
Debt Offer described on _Schedule 5.14_ , or make any changes to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Offer. The Company covenants and agrees that, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited to
the terms and conditions to the Debt Offer, it will accept for payment, and
pay for, the Senior Subordinated Notes and effect the Indenture
Amendments, in each case contemporaneously with, and contingent upon, the
Effective Time. The Company shall enter into a customary dealer manager
agreement and a customary information agent agreement with a dealer manager
and information agent, respectively, recommended by Parent (and reasonably
acceptable to the Company).



(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare,
subject to advice and comments of Parent and Acquisition, an offer to purchase
the



 

43 Senior Subordinated Notes and forms of the related letters of transmittal and
summary advertisement, as well as all other information and exhibits that may
be necessary or advisable in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the
" _Offer Documents_ "). In the event that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VII, the Company will have the right to amend the
Offer Documents without Parents consent. All mailings to the holders of
Senior Subordinated Notes in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject
to the prior review, comment and approval of Parent and Acquisition;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the comment and approval of Parent and
Acquisition shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be mailed to
the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes as promptly as practicable
following receipt of the request from Parent and Acquisition under paragraph
(a) above to do so.



(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information should be
discovered by any party hereto, which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents mailed to holders of Senior Subordinated
Notes so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be prepared by the Company and, if required, filed by the Company
with the SEC or disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Senior
Subordinated Notes.

48 8.2 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
breach or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to
irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and

damages as a remedy.

8.4 _Interpretation_. As used herein, the words "hereof", "herein", "herewith"
and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and the words "Article" and "Section" are references to the
articles and sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Unless
otherwise provided herein, each accounting term used in this Agreement has
the meaning given to it in accordance with GAAP. As used in this Agreement,
the term "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act. When used herein, the phrase "to the
knowledge of" any Person or any similar phrase means the actual knowledge of
the officers and directors of such Person and such Persons Subsidiaries and
other individuals who have similar powers and duties as the officers of such
Persons. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. Any agreement or
statute referred to herein means such agreement or statute as from time to
time amended, qualified or supplemented, including, in the case of statutes,
by succession of comparable successor statutes. References to the Securities
Act and to the Exchange Act are also references to the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder. References to a Person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns. The table of contents and headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.



8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile), each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.



8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the schedules hereto, together with the confidentiality
and nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
(other than the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement). This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of each party hereto and to their respective successors and permitted assigns,
and, except as provided in Sections 5.3(b), 5.5 and 5.10, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.



8.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented,
only



 

50 by written agreement of Parent, Acquisition and the Company at any time prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , that, after Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no term or
condition contained in this Agreement shall be amended or modified in any
manner that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without so obtaining such further stockholder approval.



8.8 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts required hereby, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed by such party. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.



8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims arising hereunder or
relating hereto, shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of Law thereof.



8.10  _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in
the event) such court does not have complete subject matter jurisdiction, any
other court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, subject
to rights with respect to post-trial motions and rights of appeal or other
avenues of review, a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any other state court
of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.



8.11 _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any
assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.



8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, by final judgment no
longer subject to review, to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as neither the economic nor legal
substance



 

51 of the transactions contemplated herein is affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner.
