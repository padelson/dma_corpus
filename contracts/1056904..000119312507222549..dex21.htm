ARTICLE I

Section 1.1 _The Merger_ _ _.__ __

At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
FBCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.2  _Closing_ _ _.__ __

The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") to the extent it cannot be
conducted electronically shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis
LLP, 153 East 53rd Street, New York, New York 10022 (or at such other place as
agreed to by the parties) at 10:00 a.m. local time, on a date to be specified
by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be no later than the
third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other
place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing; provided
that notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ , the parties shall not be required to effect the Closing
until the earlier of (x) a date during the Marketing Period specified by
Parent on no less than three (3) business days notice to the Company, (y)
the final day of the Marketing Period and (z) the End Date, subject in each
case to the satisfaction and waiver of all of the  



 

2  conditions set forth in _Article VI_ as of the date determined pursuant to
this provision. For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed
among the parties hereto, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period
of twenty-five (25) consecutive business days after the date hereof (A) during
which (1) Parent shall have the Required Financial Information that
the Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.12_ and
(2) no event has occurred and no conditions exist that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ to fail to be satisfied assuming
the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 25-consecutive-
business-day period, and (B) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ have
been satisfied (other than conditions that by their nature can be satisfied
only at the Closing); provided that if the Marketing Period would otherwise
not end on or prior to November 21, 2007, then the Marketing Period shall be
deemed to have commenced no earlier than November 26, 2007; and provided

December 21, 2007, then the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced
no earlier than January 7, 2008; provided, further, that the Marketing Period
shall not be deemed to have commenced if, (i) after the date hereof and prior
to the completion of the Marketing Period, Ernst and Young LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Documents or (ii) if the financial statements
included in the Required Financial Information that is available to Parent on
the first day of any such 25-consecutive-business day period would not be
sufficiently current on any day during such 25-consecutive-business-day
period to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to
be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of the 25-consecutive-
business-day period.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time._

At the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by

other filings or recordings required under the FBCA in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time as the
Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Department of State of the State
of Florida, or on such later date (and at such later time if specified) as the
parties shall agree and as shall be set forth in the Articles of Merger (such
time as the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger._

The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the FBCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges
and powers of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation without reversion or impairment, and all debts, liabilities and
obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities

assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of
the Company.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_ _ _.__ __

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.1(b),
2.1(c)_, _2.1(e)_ and _5.5(a)(ii)_ , each share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, " _Company
Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ ") outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time other than any Cancelled Shares (to the extent provided in
_Section 2.1(c)_) and any Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided for in 
_Section 2.1(f)_) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive $32.50 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1_ shall
be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Rollover Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Participating Holders shall contribute the Rollover Shares to Investor
pursuant to the Management Share  



 

4  Contribution and Unit Subscription Agreements. Upon receipt of the Rollover
Shares from the Participating Holders, Investor shall immediately contribute
all of the Rollover Shares to Parent, and such Rollover Shares shall be
cancelled and retired by virtue of the Merger in accordance with _Section
2.1(c)_ below.

(c) _Company, Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any
such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(e)  _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution or otherwise with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change and to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

(f) _Dissenting Shares_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
holder of which (A) has not voted, or caused or permitted to be voted, in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (B) has exercised its
rights to appraisal in accordance with Section 607.1301, et seq., of the FBCA,
and (C) has not effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) its rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, but instead, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to payment in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 607.1301, et seq., of the
FBCA. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent
upon demand.



 

5 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 2.1(f)_, if any holder
of Shares who asserts appraisal rights shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) its rights of appraisal, then, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holders Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and less any required withholding
Taxes.

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written assertion
of appraisal rights by the holders of any Shares, withdrawals of any such
assertion, and any other instruments, notices or other documents delivered to
the Company pursuant to the FBCA which relate to any such assertion of
appraisal rights and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations,
settlements and/or proceedings with respect to any assertion of appraisal
rights under the FBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
assertion of appraisal rights or settle or offer to settle any such
assertion.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates._

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that is organized
and doing business under the Laws of the United States or any state thereof,
that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) in advance by the Company in
writing (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for
the benefit of holders of the Shares, the Company Stock Options, and the
Restricted Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares, the Rollover
Shares, the Restricted Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable upon due
surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ and (ii) the
aggregate payment payable pursuant to _Section 5.5_ to holders of Company
Stock Options and Restricted Shares (collectively, the " _Option and Stock-
Based Award Consideration_ " and, together with the amount of cash referred to
in subsection (a)(i), the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third business day following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail (x) to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares
were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
(A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, (y) to each holder of a Company Stock Option or
Restricted Share, a check in an amount, if any, due and payable to such
holder pursuant to _Section 5.5(a)(i)_ or _Section 5.5(a)(ii)_,
respectively, in respect of such Company Stock Option or Restricted Share.



 

6 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
thereby or by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders
properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less
any required withholding Taxes. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_,
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(iii) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Shares (including Restricted Shares) or holder of
Company Stock Options, such amounts as it determines in good faith are
required to be withheld or deducted under the United States Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Shares (including Restricted Shares) or holder of the Company Stock
Options, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Except as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2006, the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and
Current Reports on Form 8-K filed since January 1, 2007, in each case, filed
with the SEC by the Company prior to the date hereof (and excluding
risk factors and similarly cautionary and forward looking disclosure under
the headings "Risk Factors", "Forward Looking Statements" or "Future Operating
Results"), or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._

_Section 3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and
complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Each of the Company
and its Affiliates is a legal entity  



 

8  duly organized, validly existing and in good standing or with active status
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its respective properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and in good standing or
with active status as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified, or in good standing or with active
status, or to have such power or authority, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, any reference to
any facts, circumstances, events or changes having a " _Company Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any facts, circumstances, events or changes that are
materially adverse to the business, properties, assets, results of operation,
financial condition or profitability of the Company, its Affiliates, and the
Managed Practices, taken as a whole, but shall not include facts,
circumstances, events or changes (a) generally affecting the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries and Managed Practices operate in the
United States or the economy or the financial or securities markets in the
United States or elsewhere in the world, including political conditions or
developments (including any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of
war or terrorism) or (b) to the extent resulting from (i) the announcement or
the existence of, or compliance with, this Agreement or the announcement of
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) changes in applicable Law, GAAP or accounting standards, or (iii) any
actions required under this Agreement to obtain any antitrust approval for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any change, effect, development, event or occurrence
described in the foregoing clause (a) or (b)(ii) above shall not constitute or
give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect only if and to the extent that
such change, effect, development, event or occurrence does not have a
materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its Affiliates as
compared to other participants in the industries in which the Company and its
Affiliates and Managed Practices operate in the United States; _provided_
_further_ that in the event the Company should fail to meet any expected
financial or operating performance targets, the fact of such failure, alone,
would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, it being understood
that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure,
but not otherwise excluded from the definition of a Company Material Adverse
Effect, may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the Companys
amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended
through the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the articles
of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws or similar organizational
documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, each as amended through the date
of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of
any provisions of its articles of incorporation or bylaws or
similar organizational documents, other than such violations as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(including Restricted Shares, restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred
stock units and dividend equivalents) (" _Other Incentive Awards_ "), the
number of Shares issuable thereunder or with respect thereto, the vesting

exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of
the Company on any matter.



 

10 (d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting

interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company or a
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens and those that are immaterial). There are no
subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to the
issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or sale with respect to any
shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of any Subsidiary of the
Company, including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding
security, instrument or agreement.

(f) _Section 3.2(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the
date hereof the name, jurisdiction of organization and the Companys
percentage ownership of any and all persons (other than Subsidiaries of the
Company) of which the Company directly or indirectly owns a 20% or greater

role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. As of the

applicable to the Company, its Affiliates, the Managed Practices and their
respective businesses and activities, or binding upon their assets or
properties except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not

Managed Practices to own, lease and operate their respective properties and
assets or to carry on their respective businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of
the Company Permits would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have an adverse affect equal to or greater than 2.5% of the
revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, has

respects in the financial statements of Batan Insurance and the Company, and
(ii) were calculated in all material respects in accordance with generally
accepted actuarial assumptions given the circumstances under which such
Contract or policy was written. To the Companys knowledge, the cash balances
of Batan Insurance are sufficient to satisfy the requirements, if any, of
applicable Law.

information provided by the Company, or its management, including, but not

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ "), Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

Section 4.1 _Qualification; Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._  

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing or with active status under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to
do business and is in good standing or with active status as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing or with active status, or to have such power or
authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially
delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "
_Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "). Parent has made available to the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the articles
of incorporation and bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of
Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended through the date of this Agreement. The
articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of
Parent and Merger Sub are in full force and effect, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any provisions of its articles
of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents, other than
such violations as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.



 

29 Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation._

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Parent and Merger Sub and by Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub,
and, except for the delivery to the Department of State of the State of
Florida for filing of the Articles of Merger, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding agreement
of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as (i) such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (ii) as the remedy of specific
performance and other forms of injunctive relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefore may be brought.

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the FBCA,
including, but not limited to, the delivery to the Department of State of the
State of Florida for filing of the Articles of Merger, (ii) the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, state securities, takeover and " _blue sky_ " laws and
(iii) the HSR Act (collectively, the " _Parent Approvals_ "), no
authorization, consent, permit, action or approval of, or filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the consummation by
Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for any such authorization, consent, permit, action, approval, filing
or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not (A)
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or (B) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does
not, and, except as described in  _Section 4.2(b)_, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement will not (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of
Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, contract, instrument, permit or license agreement binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which any of them is a party or any
of their respective properties are bound, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any
violation of any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended, of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable Laws,
other than, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), any such violation,
conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or
Lien that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.



 

30 Section 4.3 _Investigations; Litigation._

As of the date hereof, there is no investigation or review pending (or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental Entity with respect
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and there are no actions, suits,
inquiries, investigations or proceedings pending (or, to Parents knowledge,
threatened) against or affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties at law or in equity before, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case,
which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.4 _Schedule 13E-3/Proxy Statement; Other Information._ 

None of the information provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included
in the Schedule 13E-3 or the Proxy Statement will, in the case of the
Schedule 13E-3, as of the date of its filing (which shall be no later than 30
(thirty) days from the date hereof) and of each amendment or supplement
thereto and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, (i) at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto and
(ii) at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any
information so provided by Parent or Merger Sub that subsequently changes or
becomes incomplete or incorrect to the extent such changes or failure to be
complete or correct are promptly disclosed to the Company and to the further
extent that Parent and Merger Sub reasonably cooperate with the Company in
preparing, filing or disseminating updated information to the extent required
by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its Representatives that is contained or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.

Section 4.5 _Financing._

Parent has delivered to the Company true, accurate and complete copies of (a)
executed equity commitment letters to provide equity financing to Parent
and/or Merger Sub and (b) an executed debt commitment letter and related term
sheets (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and together with the equity
commitment letters described in clause (a), the " _Financing Commitments_ ")
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain
lenders and their Affiliates have committed to provide and arrange the
financings described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Debt Financing_ " and together with the equity financing referred to
in clause (a), the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, (i)
the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect
(except as permitted by this Agreement) and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger
Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth therein that
could reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent set forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this
Agreement, subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Article III_, and the satisfaction of the  



 

31  conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ , neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy the
conditions of closing to be satisfied by it set forth in the Financing
Commitments on the Closing Date. Assuming the funding of the Financing in
accordance with the Financing Commitments and the true and correctness of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ , the
proceeds from such Financing constitute all of the financing required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, together
with cash on hand from operations of the Company, are sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option
and Stock-Based Award Consideration (and any fees and expenses of or payable
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation). All of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter
to make the Debt Financing available to Parent and/or Merger Sub are set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and the equity commitment letter contains
all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the funding party to
make the equity financing thereunder available to Parent and/or Merger Sub on
the terms therein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, one or more Debt Commitment Letters may be amended, modified,
supplemented, restated or superseded at the option of Parent and Merger Sub
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time (the " _New
Financing Commitments_ "); _provided_ that the terms of any New Financing
Commitment shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, (ii)
expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter in any material respect, or (iii) reasonably be
expected to delay the Closing beyond the End Date. In such event, the terms "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and " _Financing Commitments_ " as used herein
shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so
amended, modified, supplemented, restated or superseded at the time in
question and the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect.

Section 4.6 _Capitalization of Merger Sub._

As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of
which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub
has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to
which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and
has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.7 _Finders or Brokers._

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker,
broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement who is entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or
upon consummation of the Merger.



 

32 Section 4.8 _Lack of Ownership of Company Common Stock._

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock. Other than the Support and Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated thereby, there are no voting trusts or other
agreements, arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or
other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor are there
any agreements, arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the acquisition, divestiture,
retention, purchase, sale or tendering of the capital stock or other equity
interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.9 _Interest in Competitors._

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns any interest(s), nor do any of their
respective Affiliates insofar as such Affiliate-owned interests would be
attributed to Parent or Merger Sub under the HSR Act, in any entity or person
that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a line of business
within the Companys principal lines of business.

Section 4.10 _No Additional Representations._

Parent acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent
investigation of the Company in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent acknowledges that neither
the Company nor any person has made any representation or warranty, express
or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Company furnished or made available to Parent and its Representatives
except as expressly set forth in _Article III (or the Company Disclosure
Schedules referred to therein)_, and neither the Company nor any other person
shall be subject to any liability to Parent or any of its Affiliates resulting
from the Companys making available to Parent or Parents use of such
information provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives, or
any information, documents or material made available to Parent in the due
diligence materials provided to Parent, other management presentations (formal
or informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
makes no representation or warranty to Parent with respect to any financial
projection, forecast, estimate or budget relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not included in any management presentation,
disclosure or otherwise delivered to or made available to Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates or any representatives of future
revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future
cash flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or of the future business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.11 _Solvency._

As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub assuming (i)
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ (for
such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct
in all material respects without giving effect to any " _knowledge_ ",
materiality  



 

33  or " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " qualification or exception), and
(iii) estimates, projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent
prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that
were and continue to be reasonable (provided, however, nothing herein shall be
deemed to be a guarantee of the accuracy of the information set forth
therein), immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will not
(i) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum
of its debts is greater than the fair market value (on a going concern basis)
of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than
the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts as
they mature), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
business or (iii) have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
due.

Section 4.12 _Management Agreements._

Other than (i) this Agreement and (ii) the Support and Voting Agreements and
the agreements, arrangements, transactions contemplated thereby, there are no
contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or
understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Board of Directors
or any Participating Holders, on the other hand relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the
Effective Time.

Section 4.13 _Disclaimer of Other Representation and Warranties._

Parent and Merger Sub do not make, and have not made, any representations or
warranties, express or implied, in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby other than those expressly set forth herein.

directly or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_, at any
time from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and the Termination Date, if (A)

which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Special Committee
or the Board of Directors determines in good faith could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) the Special Committee or
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Special Committees or the Companys outside legal counsel and the Advisor
that the failure of the Special Committee or the Board of Directors to take
the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such
Alternative Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable
Law, then the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish non-public
information to the third party making such  



 

40  Alternative Proposal (if, and only if, (1) prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement with confidentiality and standstill
provisions in form no more favorable to such person than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and (2) all such information has previously been

basis. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within 24
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in negotiations concerning an Alternative
Proposal pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_. Promptly upon determination by
the Special Committee or the Board of Directors that an Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written
notice advising it that the Special Committee or the Board of Directors has
made such determination, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the person making such Superior
Proposal.

(d) Other than in accordance with this _Section 5.3_, neither the Special
Committee nor the Board of Directors shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of or
regarding the Merger or this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt or recommend, any Alternative Proposal; (iii) make any

not been withdrawn or abandoned, the Board of Directors may, prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, (x) make a Change of
Recommendation and (y) enter into an agreement regarding a Superior Proposal
if, (A) the Special Committee or the Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys or the Special Committees
outside legal counsel and the Advisor, that the failure of the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the  



 

41  Companys shareholders under applicable Law, (B) the Company has given
Parent five (5) business days (the " _Notice Period_ ") prior written notice
of its intention to take such action (it being understood and agreed that the
Company shall provide notice to Parent of any material amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of any such Superior Proposal and if
at the time of such further notice, less than two business days remain in such
Notice Period, such Notice Period shall be extended such that five business
days remain in such extended period following the delivery to Parent of
such further notice), which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the person
making such Superior Proposal), and be accompanied by a copy of the proposed
transaction agreements for such Superior Proposal and any other material
documents relating thereto, and (C) during the Notice Period, the Board of
Directors or the Special Committee shall and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (D) with respect to an action described in clause (x) or (y)
above, the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
under this _Section 5.3_ and the Company shall have terminated this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_ hereof and paid the Company
Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_. No Change
of Recommendation shall change, modify or rescind any authorization, action
or approval of the Special Committee (or disinterested directors) or the Board
of Directors for purposes of causing any Anti-Takeover Statutes or other state
law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Support and Voting Agreement

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

fide proposal or offer made by any person or group of persons (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for or with respect to
(i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction
involving the Company or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose
business constitutes ten percent (10%) or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(including capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company), (ii) the direct or
indirect acquisition in a single transaction or series of related
transactions by any person of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that constitute ten percent (10%) or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) the
direct or indirect acquisition in a single transaction or series of related
transactions by any person of ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, or (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning ten percent
(10%) or more of the shares of Company Stock then outstanding.

(g) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Alternative Proposal (with all percentages, in the definition of Alternative
Proposal increased to 50%) on terms that the Special Committee or the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after  



 

42  consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and its respective outside legal counsel, (i) is at least as likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms as the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than the Participating
Holders) than the transactions provided for in this Agreement, in each case
with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), after taking into account such factors
as it considers to be appropriate (with the advice of outside legal counsel)
including, among other things, the person making such Alternative Proposal
and all legal, financial, regulatory, fiduciary, timing and other aspects of
this Agreement and such Alternative Proposal, including any conditions
relating to financing, regulatory approvals or other events or circumstances
beyond the control of the party invoking the condition and taking into account
any revisions made or proposed in writing by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the
time of determination.

Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to

misleading. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any event should occur

43  Parent, will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare and file such
amendment or supplement with the SEC to the extent required by applicable Law

view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Participating

(i) Each unexercised option to purchase or acquire shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, or the holder thereof, become fully vested and be converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time
an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the
amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share

aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest cent, less such
amounts as Parent, the Company or the Paying Agent determine in good faith are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. The
vesting of a Company Stock Option as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof
had or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option.



 

44 (ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as set forth below, each
award of restricted Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall

required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors or the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, shall adopt amendments to

provide or cause to be provided, to each individual who is a current employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (" _Company
Employees_ ") total compensation and benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the total compensation and benefits provided to
Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time (excluding any equity
based compensation, equity based benefits and nonqualified deferred
compensation programs); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to establish or amend any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or to prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit

obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable
Law or shall cause or require the extension, renewal or amendment of, or
prevent the expiration of, any employment agreement which shall expire,
terminate or fail to renew pursuant to its terms during such period. Nothing
in this _Section 5.5(b)(i) _or this Agreement shall limit the right of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment
of any employee at any time and for any or no reason.

(ii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans
providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service and shall not apply with respect to any equity-based
arrangement. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company  



 

45  Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents in the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

(iii) The provisions of this _Section 5.5(b)_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employees), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 5.5(b)_ under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement).

Agreement, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv)

_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Effective Time in no event shall
the Company or any of its Affiliates, absent the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
pay or commit to pay any material fee, material penalties or other material
consideration to any landlord or other third party to obtain any consent,
approval or waiver required for the consummation of the Merger under any real
estate leases or Company Material Contracts.



 

46 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting

each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made

views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees not to (A) participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either

the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate, (B) extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (C)

of the other party.

Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)_ or _7.1(c)_ so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
_Section 5.6_.

that are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening competition through merger or acquisition, or (ii) protect the
national security or the national economy of any nation.

Section 5.7 _Anti-Takeover Statutes._

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Support and Voting
Agreements, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective
Boards of Directors (and, in the case of the Company, the Special Committee)

Support and Voting Agreements may be effectuated and consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Support and

effects of such Anti-Takeover Statute on or with respect to the transactions
and agreements contemplated by this Agreement and the Support and Voting
Agreements.

with and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the
issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release
announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Director and Officer Liability._

(a) Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, take
any action to alter or impair, any exculpatory or indemnification provisions
existing in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation or in the written indemnification agreements set forth on _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule for the benefit of any individual
who served as a director or officer of the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the Surviving Corporation shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, comply with all of the Companys and its
respective Subsidiaries obligations to indemnify and hold harmless (including
any obligations to advance funds for expenses) (i) the present and former
officers and directors thereof against any and all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative ("
_Damages_ "),  



 

48  arising out of, relating to or in connection with any acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time to the
extent provided under the Companys or such Subsidiaries respective
organizational and governing documents or agreements in effect on the date
hereof, including, without limitation, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (ii) such persons against any and all Damages arising out
of acts or omissions in connection with any such person serving as an
officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with the terms of the Surviving Corporations
articles of incorporation and bylaws from the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statue of limitations with respect to any claims
against such directors, officers or employees arising out of such acts or
omissions. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the
conduct of an individual seeking indemnification has complied with the
standards set forth under applicable Law shall be made by independent counsel
mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and such individual. For a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained in effect, the current policies of officers and
directors liability insurance, employment practice insurance and fiduciary
liabilities insurance maintained on the date hereof by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Current Policies_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation may, and in the event of the cancellation or termination
of such policies shall substitute therefor policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers providing such coverage and amount and containing
such terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered persons in
respect of claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior
to or at the Effective Time under the Current Policies; _provided_ , 
_further_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend annually in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company under the Current Policies and if the annual premium
exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall provide the maximum
amount of coverage that can be obtained for such amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage,
Parent may direct the Company to purchase "tail" insurance coverage that
provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage described above,
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to pay any amounts in
respect of such coverage prior to the Closing. 

(b) This _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on
the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns, and the agreements
and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any
other rights to which any such present or former director or officer is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
any such policies.

consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii) transfers or conveys
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each
case to the extent reasonably necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_

Section 5.10 _Notice of Certain Events._

Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly notify the other party of:

(a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect;

(b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event,
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to
cause the failure by such party to comply with or satisfy, any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

(c) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from any
person alleging that the consent of such person, which consent is or
could reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the operation of their businesses, is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity (including those relating to the compliance with
any Health Care Law) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter except as expressly
permitted by _Section 4.5_. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing
unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments, Parent shall immediately notify the Company, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange any such portion from alternative sources on terms and conditions,
taken as a whole, no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Parent and Merger Sub).

Section 5.12 _Financing Cooperation._

From the date of this Agreement until Closing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to,

connection with obtaining the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, including (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and

Affiliates as the obligor, (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its independent accountants to provide assistance and cooperation to
Parent, including participating in a reasonable number of drafting sessions
and accounting due diligence sessions, (iv) executing and delivering any
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements or
other definitive financing documents or other certificates, legal opinions and
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including certificates of
the chief financial officer or any of the Companys Affiliates with respect
to financing matters) or otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral as
may be reasonably requested by Parent; provided that any obligations contained
in such documents shall be effective no earlier than as of the Effective
Time, (v) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their financing sources as
promptly as practicable with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Affiliates as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including all financial statements and financial and other data of
the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, including audits
thereto to the extent so required (which audits shall be unqualified), under
the Securities Act and of the type and form customarily included in offering
documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, to
consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (information required to be delivered pursuant to this
clause (v) being referred to as, the " _Required Financial Information_ "),
(vi) obtaining accountants comfort letters, accountants consents, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent,
(vii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the lenders under
the Debt Commitment Letter to evaluate the Companys and its Affiliates
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, and (B) establish bank  



 

51  and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements
in connection with the foregoing, provided that such accounts, agreements
and arrangements will not become active or take effect until the Effective
Time, (viii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Parent in connection with the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to enter into any agreement that
is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any purchase
agreement), and (ix) take all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation
of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the direct
borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the financing contemplated by
the Commitments prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on
a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Affiliates for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Commitments and any information utilized in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth
in _Section 6.3(b)_ of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys
obligations under this _Section 5.12_, shall be deemed satisfied unless the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or any alternative
financing) has not been obtained as a result of the Companys willful and
material breach of its obligations under this _Section 5.12_. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and its Affiliates logos in connection
with the financing contemplated by the Commitments; provided that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Affiliates. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company and its Affiliates obtained by
Parent or the Parent Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 5.12_ shall
be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses
or other documents prepared pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall contain
such information as is customarily contained in documents for similar
financing transaction.

and similar taxes, fees and charges imposed as a result of the change
of control and transfer of the Real Property to Parent (collectively, the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), together with any interest, penalties or additions to
such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation. The Company
and Parent shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and
forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all
applicable laws in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes, and
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible
under such laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in connection
therewith.

become final and non-appealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall have used
its commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Order or other action;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such
final, non-appealable Order or the failure of remove such Order was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the Company Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponement thereof) shall have concluded and the Company
Shareholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
obtained;

(e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_
and (ii) cannot be cured by the End Date,  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement;

(f) by Parent, if (A) the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall have failed to comply in any material respect with the
provisions in _Section 5.3_ of this Agreement or the Board of Directors or
the Special Committee shall have resolved to do so, or (B) the Company shall
have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties or agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ and (ii) cannot be cured by the End
Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent is not then in material breach of
this Agreement;

(g) by the Company, if prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
(x) the Special Committee or the Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with the Special Committees or the Companys

failure to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders (other than the Participating Holders) under applicable Law, (y)
the Company has complied in all material respects with _Section 5.3_, and (z)
concurrent with such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;

(h) by the Company, if Parent does not give effect to the Closing within five
(5) business days after notice by the Company to Parent that the conditions
set forth in _Sections 6.1 _  



 

56  and _6.3_ are satisfied and Parent fails to effect the Merger within three
(3) business days following the final day of the Marketing Period; 
_provided_ , that at the time of such notice and at the time of such
termination, the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6._ 3 shall in
fact be and shall remain satisfied; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(h)_ if, at the time of such termination, there exists a breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant by the Company that would result
in the failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ ; and

(i) by Parent, if (x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
effected a Change of Recommendation, or (y) the Company has failed to include
the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_,
this Agreement shall terminate (except for the Confidentiality Agreement
referred to in _Section 5.2_ and the provisions of _Sections 7.2_ and _8.2_
through _8.14_ ), and there shall be no other liability on the part of the
Company or Parent to the other except: (A) as provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement; (B) as set forth in _Section 7.2_, as applicable;
and (C) for liability arising out of fraud or an intentional breach of this
Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights
and remedies available at law or in equity and may seek to prove additional
damages as contemplated by _Sections 7.3_ , _7.4_ and _8.12_ below, as
applicable.

Actions taken by the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall be taken
by the Special Committee if then in existence.

Neither the Company nor Parent may terminate this Agreement or abandon the
Merger except in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.1_.

Section 7.2 _Termination Fees._

(a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) in the event that (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any
Alternative Proposal (substituting 50% for the 10% threshold set forth in the
definition of Alternative Proposal) which could or could reasonably be
expected to result in a transaction as favorable or more favorable to the
holders of Company Common Stock (other than the Participating Holders) than
the transactions provided for in this Agreement at such time as the bona fide
intention of any person to make such Alternative Proposal is publicly proposed
or publicly disclosed or otherwise made known to the Company prior to the time
of such termination, (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_, or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_, and (C)
concurrently with or within nine (9) months after such termination, any
definitive agreement providing for an Alternative Proposal shall have been
entered into, the Company shall pay to Holdings a fee of $25,000,000 in cash
(the " _Company Termination Fee_ "); provided, no Company Termination Fee
shall be payable if Holdings has previously paid the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.2(b);



 

57 (ii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(g)_, on the date of execution of a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall pay to Holdings the
Company Termination Fee;

(iii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(i)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Holdings no later than the second business day following the day of such
termination;

(iv) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ (regardless of whether Parent is entitled to payment
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_), by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, by either party pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)_, or by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_, the Company shall pay to Holdings, upon
termination, an amount in cash equal to the sum of Parents and Merger Subs
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses reasonably incurred by it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,000,000 (the " _Company
Expense Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the existence of
circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall not
relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the Company Expense
Reimbursement pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_; and, provided, further,
that the payment by the Company of the Company Expense Reimbursement pursuant
to this _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)(i)_.

The Company Termination Fee and the Company Expense Reimbursement shall be
paid by wire transfer of same day funds as directed by Holdings reasonably in
advance. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or
the Company Expense Reimbursement referred to in this _Section 7.2(a)_ on
more than one occasion. Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and the
Company Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to Parent, Merger Sub, their Affiliates or
otherwise except for liability arising out of fraud or an intentional breach
of this Agreement, in which case Parent shall have such rights and remedies
as are contemplated by _Sections 7.4_ and _8.12_ below (in addition to any
amounts owed to such party under Section 7.2).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ and the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ would have been satisfied had the Closing been
scheduled on the End Date, or (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_, then Holdings or its Affiliates shall pay, upon
termination, $25,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the Company or
as directed by the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any
event, within two (2) business days following such termination), payable by
wire transfer of same day funds. Under no circumstances shall the Parent
Termination Fee be payable more than once pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_.
Concurrently with the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Holdings shall
also pay to the Company an amount equal to the sum of the Companys documented
out of pocket fees and expenses reasonably incurred by it on and after
September 24, 2007 in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an aggregate amount not to
exceed  



 

58  $3,000,000 (the " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ "). Upon payment of the
Parent Termination Fee and Parent Expense Reimbursement, neither Holdings,
Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Company,
its stockholders, Affiliates or otherwise except for liability arising out of
fraud or an intentional breach of this Agreement, in which case the Company
shall have such rights as are contemplated by _Section 7.3_ below.

(c) Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall be net of any
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

(d) Each of Holdings, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ do
not constitute a penalty but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount to compensate the receiving party for efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Accordingly, if a party fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee, the Company Expense Reimbursement or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, pursuant to this  _Section 7.2_, and the receiving party
commences a suit to obtain such payments, which results in a judgment against
the paying party for the applicable amount due under this _Section 7.2_, such
paying party shall pay the receiving party its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

Section 7.3 _Limitation of Liability of Parent, Merger Sub and Their
Affiliates._  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
_Section 8.12(b)_ and the following sentence of this _Section 7.3_, if
Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing or otherwise are in breach of
this Agreement, then the monetary liability of Parent, Merger Sub and any of
their respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees, in the aggregate, shall be limited to an amount equal to the
Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement or, in the
circumstances described in the following sentence, the Parent Liability Cap,
and no person shall have any rights under the Equity Commitment Letter,
whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current and future
direct and indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, mangers, general
or limited partners or assignees shall have any further monetary liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except as expressly provided herein, except
in the event of fraud or an intentional breach of this Agreement, in which
case the Company shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity solely with respect to the recovery of monetary damages, provided
that in no event shall the Company seek to prove or recover damages that,
together with any Parent Termination Fee and Parent Expense  



 

59  Reimbursement received by the Company, exceed $40,000,000 (the " _Parent
Liability Cap_ "). The parties hereby agree that in the event Parent takes or
fails to take any action or to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any related document based on Parents good faith determination,
with a reasonable basis, that such action, inaction or non-performance is
consistent with the terms of this Agreement or other related document, and it
is ultimately determined that such action, inaction or non-performance was not
consistent with the terms hereof or of such other related document, then the
resulting breach by Parent shall not constitute an intentional breach or
fraud by Parent for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Limitation of Liability of the Company._

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
_Section 8.12(a)_ and the following sentence of this _Section 7.4_, if the
Company fails to effect the Closing or otherwise is in breach of this
Agreement, then the monetary liability of the Company and any of its
respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees, in
the aggregate, shall be limited to an amount equal to the Company Termination
Fee and the Company Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, and no person shall
have any rights, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. None of the Company or its former, current and future direct and
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited
partners or assignees shall have any further monetary liability or obligation
relating to or arising our of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement except as expressly provided herein except in the event of
fraud or an intentional breach of this Agreement, in which case the Parent
shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity
and may seek to prove and recover additional damages (in addition to any
amounts otherwise owed to such party under this Agreement). The parties hereby
agree that in the event the Company takes or fails to take any action or to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or any related document
based on the Companys good faith determination, with a reasonable basis, that
such action, inaction or non-performance is consistent with the terms of this
Agreement or other related document, and it is ultimately determined that such
action, inaction or non-performance was not consistent with the terms hereof
or of such other related document, then the resulting breach by the Company
shall not constitute an intentional breach or fraud by the Company for
purposes of this Agreement.

be enforced as written. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction; _provided_ that, if any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable and, _provided_ , _further_
that upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Support and Voting
Agreements, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
of the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all
other prior oral or written agreements and understandings between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Except for the
provisions of _Section 5.9_ (which in each case shall inure to the benefit of
the persons benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof), this Agreement is not intended to and shall not
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder. No representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or
condition not set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by any
of the parties hereto.

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if then in existence),
Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom
the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of
Company Shareholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ
Global Select Market require further approval of the shareholders of the
Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the
approval of the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Section 8.12 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that immediate and irreparable harm
would occur for which the payment of money would not compensate the
affected party and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to an  



 

64  injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
of the State of Florida or any Federal court sitting in the State of Florida,
without proof of actual damages or the posting of bond or other security, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_, Parent and
Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy shall be the remedies set forth in 
_Section 7.2_; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event a court orders
specific performance of this Agreement by the Company, such specific
performance shall be in lieu of the Company Termination Fee and Company
Expense Reimbursement.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to any
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any such
breach shall be the remedies set forth in  _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section
7.3_.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
