whatever nature, whether presently in existence or arising hereafter. All such

and obligations of Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable (all such
liabilities and obligations not being assumed being herein referred to as the
"Retained Liabilities"). Retained Liabilities include:

(a) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all debts, obligations,
contracts and liabilities of any kind, character or description (whether known
or unknown, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) relating to or arising
out of the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the conduct of
the Business prior to the Closing;

(b) all liabilities and obligations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
under the Assigned Contracts to the extent required to be paid or performed
prior to or on the day of Closing;

(c) all liabilities with respect to, or relating to, any Delayed Transfer
Contract to the extent such liabilities are retained by Seller or Buyer does
not receive the benefit of such Delayed Transfer Contract pursuant to Section
2.05;

(d) any liability or obligation of Seller, or any member of any consolidated,
affiliated, combined or unitary group of which Seller is or has been a member,
for Taxes (except to the extent explicitly assumed in Section 2.03);
_provided_ that Transfer Taxes and Sales and Use Taxes incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
Apportioned Obligations shall be borne and paid in the manner set forth in
Section 8.01 hereof;

(e) any liability or obligation to the extent relating to an Excluded Asset;

(f) the Retained Environmental Liabilities;

(g) all of Sellers or its Subsidiaries obligations arising under any
outstanding payable arising prior to Closing between the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of the Business, on the one hand, and Seller or any
Affiliate of the Seller in respect of any other business, division, group or
function, on the other hand;

(h) all liabilities or obligations arising out of or with respect to (A) the
Business Employees and Excluded Employees employment with, their benefits,

or the termination of their employment from Seller or its Affiliates prior to
Closing; (C) all Seller Plans; (D) any and all employee grievances arising
prior to the Closing; (E) to the extent relating to the period prior to
Closing, the misclassification by Seller or its Affiliates of any Person
providing services at the Refinery or to Seller and its Subsidiaries as an
independent contractor or consultant where such classification by Seller and
its Subsidiaries should have been as a Business Employee, former employee or
Excluded Employee; and (F) any other liabilities or obligations expressly
allocated to Seller or its Affiliates under Article 9;

(i) all expenses, costs and fees (including attorneys, auditors and
advisors fees, if any) incurred by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



23 (j) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all such
other liabilities and obligations arising out of the ownership, operation or
use of the Purchased Assets or Business at any time prior to the Closing.

Section 2.05 _. Non-Assignability of Contracts._ (a) Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement, or any
benefit or obligation arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, if and to the
extent that the transfer or assignment from Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
to Buyer of any such Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement would be a
violation of Applicable Law or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the
applicable transferee thereunder as a result of the failure to obtain any
consent, approval, waiver or authorization required in connection with such
transfer or assignment, then the transfer or assignment to Buyer of such
Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement intended to be transferred or
assigned hereunder (each, a "Delayed Transfer Contract") shall
be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or
assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are
removed and/or applicable consents, approvals, waivers or authorizations have
been obtained. Seller and Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the applicable third party for the assignment or
transfer of the Delayed Transfer Contracts. If the transfer or assignment of
any Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement intended to be transferred
or assigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Closing as a
result of Section 2.05(a), then Seller or its Subsidiary shall thereafter,
directly or indirectly, hold such Assigned Contract, Permit or
other agreement, together with any proceeds therefrom, in trust for the use
and benefit of Buyer (and at the expense of Buyer), insofar as reasonably
practicable. In addition, to the extent not prohibited, Seller shall take or
cause to be taken such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
in order to place Buyer, insofar as reasonably practicable, in the same
position as if such Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement had been
transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens
relating to such Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement, including
possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and
command over such Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement, are to
inure from and after the Closing to Buyer. Such reasonable arrangements may
include the entering into of a subcontract, sublicense, sublease or other
similar arrangement between Seller and Buyer. During the period from Closing
until such required consent, approval, waiver or authorization is obtained,
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such Assigned
Contract, Permit or other agreement of Seller for the benefit of Buyer, on the
condition that Buyer shall bear all costs and expenses (including legal
expenses) related to such enforcement. To the extent Buyer is able to receive
the economic rights and benefits under such Assigned Contract, Permit or other
agreement, the economic rights and benefits so received shall constitute a
Purchased Asset, and the liabilities and obligations, if any, related to such
economic rights and benefits under such Assigned Contract, Permit or other
agreement shall constitute an Assumed Liability of Buyer. To the extent Buyer
is unable to receive any economic rights and benefits under an Assigned
Contract, Permit or other agreement, then Buyer shall not assume any
liabilities or obligations under such Assigned Contract, Permit or other
agreement and such Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement shall
constitute a Retained Liability; _provided_ that as and to the extent that
Buyer is subsequently able to receive any such economic rights and benefits
that it previously was unable to receive, then Buyer shall at such time
assume the related liabilities and obligations not previously assumed. To the
extent Buyer

 



24  is able to receive some but not all of the economic rights and benefits
under an Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement, (i) that portion of the
economic rights and benefits so received shall constitute a Purchased Asset
and the liabilities and obligations, related to such portion of the economic
rights and benefits shall constitute an Assumed Liability of Buyer, and (ii)
as to that portion of the economic rights and benefits which Buyer is not
able to receive, Buyer shall not assume any of the related liabilities or
obligations under such Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement and such
Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement shall constitute a Retained
Liability to the extent of the liabilities and obligations not assumed by
Buyer.

(b) To the extent permitted and to the extent otherwise permissible in light
of any required consent, approval, waiver or authorization, Buyer shall be
entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the management of any Assigned
Contract not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section 2.05 and the
parties hereto agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and
coordinate with respect thereto.

(c) If and when the consents, approvals, legal impediments, waivers or
authorizations, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any
Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement pursuant to this Section 2.05,
are obtained or removed, as the case may be, the transfer of the applicable
Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement to Buyer shall automatically and
without further action be effected in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

(d) Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all third party transfer
fees and other commercially reasonable costs, fees and expenses, if any,
necessary to secure any third person consents or otherwise effect the transfer
of any Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement pursuant to this Section
2.05; _provided_ however, that Seller shall not be obligated (x) to pay any
costs, fees or expenses to the extent they do not relate to the receipt of a
third party consent or the effecting of a transfer ( _e.g._ payments relating
to term extensions or the modification of any terms of any Assigned
Contract), (y) to pay or assume any costs or expenses of Buyer or its counsel
incurred in furtherance of Buyers obligations hereunder or any costs or
expense resulting from Buyers failure to honor its obligations under this
Agreement, or (z) to provide any form of bank guarantee, parent company
guaranty, bond, letter of credit or other credit support or enhancement to
secure any third person consent or otherwise effect the transfer of any
Assigned Contract, Permit or other agreement pursuant to this Section 2.05.
Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller at Closing (and as to any third person
consents obtained after Closing within 5 Business Days following presentation
of the third person consent and a statement of the fees incurred) for one-
half of the fees, costs and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of
Sellers counsel) incurred by Seller under this Section 2.05(d) to secure any
third person consents or otherwise effect the transfer of any Assigned
Contract, Permit or other agreement pursuant to this Section 2.05.

(e) The parties hereto further agree that, (i) to the extent that Buyer is
able to receive the economic rights and benefits under any Assigned Contract,
Permit or other agreement referred to in this Section 2.05, such Delayed
Transfer Contract shall be treated for all income Tax purposes as an asset of
Buyer and (ii) neither Buyer nor Seller shall take, and each of Buyer and
Seller shall prevent any of their respective Affiliates from taking, any
position inconsistent with such treatment for any income Tax purposes (unless
required by a change in applicable income Tax law or a good faith resolution
of a contest).

the Collins / TandM Shares, for which the purchase price is as set forth in
Section 2.06(a)) in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (as to each of
Buyer and Seller, the "Allocation"). Buyer and Seller will make reasonable

Section 2.08 _. Hydrocarbon Inventory and Adjustment._ (a) No later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a certificate of Seller setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of
the Inventory Value (the "Estimated Inventory Value") as it will be
determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.08
and Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit B-2 of this Agreement. Such certificate shall
include Sellers calculations used to determine the Estimated Inventory Value,
which shall be provided in an

 



28  Excel spreadsheet. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Unit and
Pipework Fill (as that term is defined in Exhibit B-1) and Excess BSandW shall
be included as part of the Purchased Assets but shall not be valued or
included in the Inventory Value. The certificate shall also set forth Sellers
estimates of the ownership, types, characteristics and volumes, on a tank,
trunk, pipeline or other location basis, of all Hydrocarbon Inventory.

(b) An inventory committee (the "Inventory Committee") consisting of one
representative of each of Seller and Buyer shall be established to oversee the
physical inventory measurement of the Hydrocarbon Inventory pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Exhibit B-1. As soon as practical after the Execution
Date, Buyer and Seller shall each designate its Inventory Committee
representative and the representatives shall engage a mutually agreeable
independent inspector (the "Field Inspector"). The Field Inspector shall
measure the Refinery Hydrocarbon Inventory (as that term is defined in
Exhibit B-1), including volumes of BSandW as of Closing (except that any
Facilities Mid-Delivery Shipment will be measured in accordance with Exhibit
B-1) at the respective locations of the Refinery Hydrocarbon Inventory on the
Closing Date and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the
volumes of all In Bound/Out Bound Inventory shall be determined as set forth
on Exhibit B-1 and shall not be measured by the Field Inspector or included
in the Field Inspector Report, and (ii) the crude tank composition percentages
shall be determined as set forth on Exhibit B-1 and will not be measured by
the Field Inspector or included in the Field Inspector Report (the amounts
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Other Amounts"). With respect to the
Hydrocarbon Inventory measured by the Field Inspector, such Hydrocarbon
Inventory shall be measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Exhibit B-l. Buyer shall not take or permit to be taken any actions that would
reduce the level of Hydrocarbon Inventory between the time of the Closing and
such time that the Field Inspector completes its measurement procedures
unless Buyer and Seller mutually agree upon adjustments and/or procedures to
appropriately account for any such reduction. Promptly upon appointment of the
Field Inspector, Seller shall provide Buyer and the Field Inspector with all
information relating to the Hydrocarbon Inventory, including tank and product
types, which is necessary to design and carry out an effective physical
inventory in the manner set forth in Exhibit B-1. The Inventory Committee
shall use this information to develop a mutually agreed upon gauging and
sampling schedule by location and tank (the "Inventory Schedule"). The
Inventory Schedule shall be approved by the Inventory Committee no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing.

 

(c) The Field Inspector shall issue a written report (the "Field Inspector
Report") to Buyer and Seller within 10 Business Days after the Closing Date
setting forth the volumes (which shall be temperature, API gravity, BSandW and
pressure corrected) and qualitative laboratory results of the Refinery
Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Closing (except that any Facilities Mid-
Delivery Shipment will be measured in accordance with Exhibit B-1) and
reasonable detail regarding the calculation thereof. During a fifteen (15) day
review period following receipt by Buyer and Seller of the Field Inspector
Report, either Buyer or Seller may question the calculations and/or laboratory
results set forth therein (to the extent such Hydrocarbon Inventory is
measured by the Field Inspector in accordance with Exhibit B-1) and the
members of the Inventory Committee shall resolve any outstanding quantity and
quality disputes; _provided_ that (i) to the extent the members of the
Inventory Committee are unable to resolve any dispute as to quantity, such
dispute shall be submitted to the Field Inspector who,

 



29  within 5 Business Days of receipt, shall make a determination with respect
to such dispute, which determination shall be final and binding on Buyer and
Seller and (ii) to the extent the members of the Inventory Committee are
unable to resolve any dispute as to quality, such dispute shall be submitted
to an appropriate specialist, jointly retained by Buyer and Seller who shall
make a determination with respect to such dispute within 10 Business Days of
receipt in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.13, which
determination shall be final and binding on Buyer and Seller and shall be
incorporated into and form a part of the Field Inspector Report. At the
end of such review period and following resolution of all quantity and
quality disputes (subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence), the
quantity and quality entries set forth in the adjusted Field Inspector Report
for the Refinery Hydrocarbon Inventory will be deemed to be final and binding
on Buyer and Seller. Except as otherwise specifically provided, the fees and
expenses of the Field Inspector shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 20 days
following receipt of the final Field Inspector Report, Seller shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement, together with supporting
calculations and information (the "Inventory Statement"), setting forth the
Other Amounts and (based on the amounts in the final Field Inspector Report
and the Other Amounts) the value of the Hydrocarbon Inventory (the "Inventory
Value"), which value shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Exhibit B-2. No later than 30 days following its receipt of the
Inventory Statement Buyer shall give Seller notice of (A) its acceptance of
the Inventory Statement or (B) specific and reasonably detailed objections to
the valuation (but not the volumes) set forth in the Inventory Statement (and
Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all matters set forth in the
Inventory Statement that are not objected to). If Buyer fails to give such
notice before the end of such 30 day period, the Inventory Statement will
be deemed final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. If Buyer gives such notice
to Seller of Buyers objection within such 30 days, and Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve the issues in dispute within 10 days after delivery of such
notice of objection, each of Buyers and Sellers positions on the remaining
items in dispute with respect to the computation of the Inventory Value will
be submitted to an independent and qualified party mutually selected by Buyer
and Seller (the "Inspector") such as an accounting firm or independent
inspector, for final resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.13.

 

(e) If the Inventory Value (as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.08) minus the Estimated Inventory Value (such difference, the "Inventory
Balance") is greater than zero, Buyer shall pay to Seller, without offset or
deduction, an amount equal to the Inventory Balance by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts of Seller or its
Subsidiaries as may be designated by Seller. If the amount of the Inventory
Balance is less than zero, then Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Buyer, without offset or deduction, an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Inventory Balance by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of Buyer as may be designated by Buyer. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) shall be made within five Business Days after
the Inventory Value has been finally determined and shall bear interest from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect from time to time during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment; _provided_ that any
payment that has not been made within such five Business Day period shall
accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 15% for the period beginning on
the last day of such five-Business Day

 



30  period to but excluding the date of payment (or, if such rate exceeds the
maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, at the maximum rate per annum
permitted by Applicable Law). Such interest shall be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

(f) Each party agrees that, following the Closing, it shall not take any
actions with respect to the accounting books, records, policies and procedures
of itself or its Affiliates that would obstruct or prevent the preparation of
the Inventory Statement as provided in this Section 2.08. From the Closing
through the final determination of the Inventory Value in accordance with this
Section 2.08, Seller and Buyer shall provide one another with reasonable
access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, and books and
records of the applicable refinery for purposes of determining the Inventory
Value, including permitting Buyer and Seller and their respective advisors
to participate in the taking of the physical inventory.

(g) Except as expressly set forth in Section 2.08(c), 2.08(d) or Section
2.13, Buyer and Seller shall each bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with the preparation and review of the Inventory Statement.

 

Section 2.09. _Additional Adjustments._ (a) Except as provided in Section
8.01(c) hereof, Buyer and Seller agree that the items listed in Section
2.09(a)(i)-Section 2.09(a)(vii) (but excluding any income Taxes and without
duplication) and relating to the Business or operation of the Purchased Assets
shall be prorated as of the Closing, with the Seller liable to the extent
such items relate to any time period prior to the Closing, and the Buyer
liable to the extent such items relate to periods on (including those items
arising as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) or after the Closing (in each case, measured in the same
units used to compute the item in question, or otherwise measured by calendar
days), and, in accordance with Section 2.09(b), the Cash Amount shall be
increased by the amount of Petty Cash and by the pro-rated amount of all such
payments made by Seller and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing but that are
attributable to periods on or after the Closing and the Cash Amount shall be
decreased by the pro-rated amount of all such payments to be made by Buyer
subsequent to the Closing but that are attributable to periods prior to the
Closing:

(i) personal property, real estate and occupancy Taxes, assessments and other
similar charges, including those of the type that could give rise to a
Permitted Lien or are payable in installments of which any installment is due
and payable, if any, on or with respect to the Business or operation of the
Purchased Assets; _provided_ that the proration of Taxes referred to in this
Section 2.09(a)(i) shall be made in accordance with Article 8; 

(ii) rent, Taxes and all other items (including prepaid services or goods not
included in Hydrocarbon Inventory) payable by or to the Seller or its
Subsidiaries under any Assigned Contracts;

(iii) any permit fees, license fees, registration fees or other similar fees
with respect to any Business Permits;

(iv) sewer rents and charges for water, telephone, electricity and other
utilities;

 



31 (v) other fees or charges imposed by any Governmental Authority; and 

(vi) the Prepayments (other than those set forth on Section 2.09(a)(vi) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule), it being understood that for purposes of this
Section 2.09(a)(vi), any deposit or similar payment securing a performance
obligation will be deemed to be a Prepayment that relates to periods after the
Closing Date regardless of actual timing of the performance obligation;

(vii) payments under the Assigned Contracts; _provided_ that if Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Affiliates makes any payment to a
third party pursuant to any Assigned Contract and (A) such payment is made in
respect of work performed, services provided or goods delivered during
a period of time that includes the Closing or (B) the Closing occurs between
the making of such payment and the performance of the work or services or
delivery of goods, the Buyer and Seller will allocate the burden of such
payment in a manner that reflects the relative benefit of such work
performed, services provided or goods delivered to each party;

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that for purposes of
determining the pro-rations pursuant to this Section 2.09(a), the Closing Date
will be included in the time period for which Seller is responsible, except to
the extent the relevant matter arises as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) At Closing, the Cash Amount shall be increased or decreased (as
applicable) by an amount equal to Sellers good faith estimate of the amount
of Petty Cash and the prorations referred to in Section 2.09(a) (such
estimate, the "Estimated Closing Proration Adjustment Amount"), and a further
adjustment to account for the difference between the estimated amounts and the
actual amounts (the "Post-Closing Proration Adjustment Amount") shall be made
after the Closing by mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer within 45 days
after the Closing Date (or 120 days of the Closing Date, in the case of
prorations referred to in Section 2.09(a)(i)) and no further adjustment
payment in respect thereof shall be made thereafter. The prorations relating
to a time period shall be based on the number of days in a year or other
appropriate period (i) through and including the Closing Date and (ii) after
the Closing Date. The Seller and the Buyer agree to furnish each other with
such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to
confirm all adjustment and proration calculations made pursuant to Section
2.09(a) and this Section 2.09(b). If Seller and Buyer are not able
to mutually agree on a Post-Closing Proration Adjustment Amount within the
periods specified above, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an accounting
referee (the "Accounting Referee") to resolve the dispute in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.13. Any post-Closing payment pursuant
to this Section 2.09(b) shall be made within 5 Business Days after the Post-
Closing Proration Adjustment Amount has been finally determined, whether by
mutual agreement or dispute resolution (the "Post-Closing Adjustment Date"),
and shall bear interest from and including the Post-Closing Adjustment Date to
but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest
Rate in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to
the date of payment; _provided_ that any payment that has not been made within
such 5 Business Days period shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to
15% for the period beginning on the last day of such 5 Business Days period
to but excluding the date of payment

 



32  (or, if such rate exceeds the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, at
the maximum rate per annum permitted by Applicable Law). Such interest shall
be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
elapsed.

 

Section 2.10 _. Turnaround Expenditure Amount._ (a) The Parties acknowledge
that Seller has scheduled a turnaround of the Refinery pursuant to the scope
set forth on Section 2.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Refinery
Turnaround") in the first quarter of 2012; _provided_ that Seller may elect to
delay the Refinery Turnaround so long as at the time of such election, Seller
has reasonably concluded that such delay will not (i) violate any Applicable
Law, (ii) result in a material health or safety violation at the Refinery or
(iii) result in a material environmental release or spill at the Refinery. In
connection with the Refinery Turnaround, Seller may incur certain third party
expenditures (the "Turnaround Expenditures") between the Execution Date and
the Closing Date, including the expenditures described in Section 2.10 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent incurred between the Execution Date
and the Closing Date. The Purchase Price will be adjusted for an amount equal
to fifty percent 50% of the Turnaround Expenditures (the "Turnaround
Expenditure Amount") in accordance with Section 2.06(a). Promptly following
the Closing, but in no event later than 45 days thereafter, Seller shall
provide Buyer with a statement setting forth its determination of the
Turnaround Expenditure Amount together with reasonable supporting calculations
and information. Seller shall give Buyer and its advisors reasonable access to
the books and records for the purpose of verifying the
Turnaround Expenditures and the Turnaround Expenditure Amount. Buyer shall be
deemed to have agreed with the amount set forth on such statement unless Buyer
notifies Seller in writing of its disagreement within 30 days of Buyers
receipt of such statement. If Buyer so notifies Seller, Seller and Buyer
shall work in good faith to resolve any such disagreement as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 10 days of such notification. If Seller
and Buyer are not able to mutually agree on a determination of the Turnaround
Expenditure Amount within the period specified above, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly retain an Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.13. If the Final Turnaround Expenditure
Amount exceeds the Estimated Turnaround Expenditure Amount, Buyer shall pay to
Seller, without offset or deduction, the amount of such excess to such account
or accounts as may be designated by Seller. If the Estimated Turnaround
Expenditure Amount exceeds the Final Turnaround Expenditure Amount, Seller
shall pay to Buyer, without offset or deduction, the amount of such excess to
such account or accounts as may be designated by Buyer. As used
herein, "Final Turnaround Expenditure Amount" means the amount set forth on
the statement delivered by Seller pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) (if Buyer
does not notify Seller of a disagreement as set forth herein) or the
Turnaround Expenditure Amount as mutually agreed or finally determined
pursuant to dispute resolution by Seller and Buyer.

(b) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be made within 5 Business
Days after the Final Turnaround Expenditure Amount has been determined and
shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect from
time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment;
_provided_ that any payment that has not been made within such 5 Business Day
period shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 15% for the period
beginning on the last day of such 5 Business Day period to but excluding the
date of payment (or, if such rate exceeds

 



33  the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, at the maximum rate per annum
permitted by Applicable Law). Such interest shall be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 2.11. _Accrued Vacation Adjustment_.

(a) Promptly following the Closing, but in no event later than 45 days
thereafter, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth its
determination of the Accrued Vacation Adjustment (which may be a positive or
negative number) together with reasonable supporting calculations and
information. Seller shall give Buyer and its advisors reasonable access to
the books and records for the purpose of verifying the Accrued Vacation
Adjustment. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with the amount set forth on
such statement unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing of its disagreement
within 30 days of Buyers receipt of such statement. If Buyer so notifies
Seller, Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 10 days of
such notification. If Seller and Buyer are not able to mutually agree on a
determination of the Accrued Vacation Adjustment within the period specified
above, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an Accounting Referee to resolve
the dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.13. If
the Final Accrued Vacation Amount is different than the Estimated Accrued
Vacation Amount, and therefore if the Final Accrued Vacation Amount had been
used to calculate the payment under Section 2.07(a)(i) (the "Section 2.07
Payment") a different Section 2.07 Payment would have resulted as compared to
the one that was in fact paid (the difference between the two, the "Section
2.07 Differential"), then the following will apply: (x) if the Section 2.07
Differential would have resulted in a higher Section 2.07 Payment, then Buyer
shall pay to Seller, without offset or deduction, the amount of the Section
2.07 Differential to such account or accounts as may be designated by Seller
and (y) if the Section 2.07 Differential would have resulted in a lower
Section 2.07 Payment, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, without offset
or deduction, the amount of the Section 2.07 Differential to such account or
accounts as may be designated by Buyer. As used herein, "Final Accrued
Vacation Adjustment" means the amount set forth on the statement delivered
by Seller pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) (if Buyer does not notify Seller
of a disagreement as set forth herein) or the Accrued Vacation Adjustment as
mutually agreed or finally determined pursuant to dispute resolution by Seller
and Buyer. 

(b) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be made within 5 Business
Days after the Final Accrued Vacation Adjustment has been determined and
shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect from
time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment;
_provided_ that any payment that has not been made within such 5 Business Day
period shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 15% for the period
beginning on the last day of such 5 Business Day period to but excluding the
date of payment (or, if such rate exceeds the maximum rate permitted by
Applicable Law, at the maximum rate per annum permitted by Applicable Law).
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the
actual number of days elapsed.

 



34 Section 2.12. _Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Closing, but in no event later than 45 days
thereafter, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth its
determination of the Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount together with
reasonable supporting calculations and information. Seller shall give Buyer
and its advisors reasonable access to the books and records for the
purpose of verifying the Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount. Buyer shall be
deemed to have agreed with the amount set forth on such statement unless Buyer
notifies Seller in writing of its disagreement within 30 days of Buyers
receipt of such statement. If Buyer so notifies Seller, Seller and Buyer
shall work in good faith to resolve any such disagreement as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 10 days of such notification. If Seller
and Buyer are not able to mutually agree on a determination of the Retiree
Medical Adjustment Amount within the period specified above, Buyer and Seller
shall jointly retain an actuarial referee (the "Actuarial Referee") to resolve
the dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.13. If
the Final Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Retiree
Medical Adjustment Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, without offset or
deduction, the amount of such excess to such account or accounts as may be
designated by Seller. If the Estimated Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Final Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall pay to
Seller, without offset or deduction, the amount of such excess to such account
or accounts as may be designated by Buyer. As used herein, "Final Retiree
Medical Adjustment Amount" means the amount set forth on the statement
delivered by Seller pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) (if Buyer does not notify
Seller of a disagreement as set forth herein) or the Retiree Medical
Adjustment Amount as mutually agreed or finally determined pursuant to dispute
resolution by Seller and Buyer.

 

(b) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be made within 5 Business
Days after the Final Retiree Medical Adjustment Amount has been determined
and shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding
the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect
from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of
payment; _provided_ that any payment that has not been made within such 5
Business Day period shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 15% for
the period beginning on the last day of such 5 Business Day period to
but excluding the date of payment (or, if such rate exceeds the maximum rate
permitted by Applicable Law, at the maximum rate per annum permitted by
Applicable Law). Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the
payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of
365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 2.13. _Dispute Resolution_. In the case of any dispute submitted to
an Accounting Referee, Actuary Referee or an Inspector pursuant to this
Agreement, (i) the Inspector, Actuary Referee or Accounting Referee, as
applicable, shall only consider those items as to which Buyer and Seller
disagree, (ii) each party will furnish to the Inspector, Actuary Referee or
Accounting Referee, as applicable, such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Inspector, Actuary Referee
or Accounting Referee, as applicable, may request and are available to such
party, and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Inspector,
Actuary Referee or Accounting Referee, as applicable, any material relating to
such issues and to discuss the same with the Inspector, Actuary Referee or
Accounting Referee, as applicable, (iii) the Inspectors, Actuary Referees or
Accounting Referees determination or 

 



35  computation of the applicable final amount or value shall be binding and
conclusive on Buyer and Seller and will be deemed to be final (provided that
with respect to each item in dispute, the Inspectors, Actuary Referees or
Accounting Referees determination or computation of the applicable final
amount or value shall be within the bounds of the applicable amount or value
submitted by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, with
respect to such item) and judgment thereupon may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which the same is sought to be
enforced and (iv) the fees and expenses of the Inspector, Actuary Referee or
Accounting Referee, as applicable, for such determination will be borne by the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items lost by the Buyer, on the
one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, bears to the total dollar amount
in dispute that is resolved by the Inspector, Actuary Referee or Accounting
Referee, as applicable.

warrants to Buyer that the following statements are true and correct as of the

Subsidiary that is transferring any Purchased Assets hereunder is an entity
duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
corporate or other powers required to carry on its business as
currently conducted. Each of Seller and each Subsidiary that is transferring
any Purchased Assets hereunder is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within Sellers corporate powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Seller. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Seller
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity).

Section 3.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (a) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (b) compliance with the matters set
forth on Section 3.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; (c) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and (d) such action or filing as

material to the Business or the Purchased Assets.

 



36 Section 3.04 _. Noncontravention._ The execution, delivery and performance
by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) violate the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of Seller or
any Subsidiary of Seller that is transferring any Purchased Assets hereunder,
(b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.03, violate
any Applicable Law, (c) except for the consents set forth in Section 3.04 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, require any consent, approval or other action
under, constitute a default under or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or to a loss of any
benefit relating to the Business to which Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller
that is transferring any Purchased Assets hereunder is entitled under any
provision of any agreement, including the Material Contracts, or other
instrument binding upon Seller or such Subsidiary or (d) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any Purchased Asset with such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. 

Section 3.05 _. Financial Statements_. Attached as Section 3.05 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule is a copy of (i) a statement of charges and yields of the
Business for the years ending December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, and the
five months ending on May 31, 2011; and (ii) a statement of the Local
Operating Expenses and Local Capital Expenditures related exclusively to the

the Included Meraux Equity Interests) for the relevant periods of such

(b) From June 30, 2011 until the Execution Date, there has not been any action
taken by Seller or its Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the
Execution Date through the Closing Date without Buyers consent, would
constitute a breach of Section 5.01(a), Section 5.01(b), or (to the extent
relating to any of the foregoing Sections) Section 5.01(h).

 



37 Section 3.07 _. Material Contracts._ (a) Except as set forth on Section

aggregate payments to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of $3,000,000 or

outstanding;

(vi) any agreement relating to indebtedness for borrowed money or the deferred
purchase price of property (in either case, whether incurred, assumed,

aggregate outstanding principal amount not exceeding $500,000.

(vii) any agreement that materially limits the freedom of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any Person or in

and other than agreements (i) for the purchase or sale of any materials,
supplies or goods on a spot market basis (on market-based terms) or (ii) with
respect to which no delivery or payment obligations remain outstanding, as of
the Execution Date neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by any material Intra-Company Agreement.

(c) Each agreement, commitment or arrangement required to be disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.07(a) (each, a "Material Contract") is a valid and
binding agreement of Seller or one of its Subsidiaries and is in full force
and effect, and none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto is in default or breach in any
respect under the terms of any such Material Contract, except for any such
failures to be valid and binding or in full force and effect, defaults or
breaches which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Section
3.07(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, as of the Execution Date neither
the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
cancellation or termination of any Material Contract from any party thereto or
written notice of any intent to do so. As of the Execution Date, to Sellers
Knowledge, no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute an event of default under any Material
Contract or result in a termination thereof or would cause or permit the
acceleration or other changes of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit thereunder, in all cases where the same would result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

(d) Section 3.07(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
each agreement, contract or other written instrument that is material to the
Business and to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and which
is regularly used in connection with the ownership and operation of the
Purchased Assets or the conduct of the Business, and that is to be retained by
Seller or its Subsidiaries and not assigned to Buyer. 

(e) Section 3.07(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
each agreement, contract or other written instrument that is material to the
Business and to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and which
is regularly used in connection with the ownership and operation of both the
Business and the Excluded Business, other than the Excluded Contracts that
are to be retained by Seller or its Subsidiaries and not assigned to Buyer.

 



39 Section 3.08 _. Litigation._ As of the Execution Date, there is no action,
suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened against, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Business before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority or subject to
any mediation which is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or which in any manner challenges or
seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 3.09 _. Compliance with Laws, Permits and Orders._ Except with respect
to Environmental Laws (which are covered by Section 3.16 hereof), neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any Applicable Law
relating to the Purchased Assets or the conduct of the Business, except for
violations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1,
2011 and prior to the Execution Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries have received any written notification from any applicable
Governmental Authority that the Purchased Assets are not in compliance with
any Applicable Law, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred,
and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse
of time) would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a failure of
the Purchased Assets to comply with any Applicable Law, with such exceptions,
in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 3.10 _. Properties._

 

(a) Sections 2.01(a), 2.01(b) and 2.01(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
correctly identify all of the Refinery Land, Refinery Real Property Leases
and appurtenant Refinery Easements used or held for use in the operation of
the Business as currently conducted. The fixed asset registries listed on
Section 3.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule under the heading "Fixed
Asset Registries" which were delivered to Buyer in the project data room list
the material fixed assets of the Business which are owned by Seller or its
Subsidiaries, as of the dates indicated on Section 3.10(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule under the heading "Fixed Asset Registries" next to the
applicable registry, excluding any assets owned by the ventures or entities
the equity interests of which make up the Included Meraux Equity Interests. 

(b) Seller or one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or in
the case of any Leased Refinery Real Property, has valid leasehold interests
in, or in the case of any Refinery Easements, has valid interests in, all
Refinery Real Estate Interests and the Office Properties free and clear of all
Liens, other than the Permitted Liens. Seller or one of its Subsidiaries has
good title to, leases or has the legal right to use all other Purchased Assets
(that is, those Purchased Assets other than Refinery Real Estate Interests),
or in the case of Sellers contract rights, receive the benefits of such
Purchased Assets, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, except
for properties and assets sold in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices or where the failure to have such good title or
valid leasehold interest would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Owned
Refinery Real Property identified in Section 2.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule as Parcel 2 of Tract 5 ("Parcel 2") is contiguous to the other Owned
Refinery Real Property and is located on the ground in the general area as
depicted for Parcel 2 on the map prepared by SunCoast Land Services, Inc. as
set forth on Section 3.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (adopted as
"Tract 8" on said map). No Purchased Asset is subject to any Lien, except:

(i) Liens disclosed on Section 3.10(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

 



40 (ii) Liens for Taxes, assessments and similar charges that are not yet due or
are being contested in good faith;

(iii) mechanics, materialmans, carriers, repairers and other similar
Liens arising or incurred in the ordinary course of business or that are not
yet due and payable or are being contested in good faith;

 

(iv) undetermined or inchoate liens or charges constituting or securing the
payment of expenses which were incurred incidental to the conduct of the
operations of the Business or the operation of the Purchased Assets if payment
of the obligation secured thereby is not yet overdue or if the validity or
amount thereof is being contested in good faith by Seller; 

(v) Liens created by law or which arise from leases, easements, rights-of-way
or other real property interests for compliance with the terms of such
leases, easements, rights-of- way or other real property interests (including
the payment of rental fees or other charges), _provided_ that they do not
materially interfere with, impair or impede the operation or value of the
Business as currently conducted by Seller;

(vi) all reservations of record of minerals (without right of surface entry)
in and under or that may be produced from any of the lands constituting part
of the Refinery Real Estate Interests or on which any of the Purchased Assets
are located;

 

(vii) all easements, rights-of-way and restrictive covenants of record;

 

(viii) all discrepancies in area, shortages in area, conflicts in boundary
lines, encroachments or protrusions, overlapping of improvements or other
state of facts that an accurate survey would show; provided that they do not
materially interfere with, impede or impair the operation or value of the
Business as currently conducted by the Seller;

 

(ix) any defect that has been cured by applicable statutes of limitations or
statutes for prescription; provided the Title Company is willing to insure
against any such defect;

(x) any defect affecting (or the termination or expiration of) any easement,
right-of-way, leasehold interest, license or other real property interest
which is replaced prior to Closing at Sellers sole cost by an easement,
right-of-way, leasehold interest, license or other real property interest
constituting part of the Purchased Assets covering substantially the same
rights to use the land or the portion thereof used by Seller or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the operation of the Business or Facilities;

 



41 (xi) Liens consisting of (A) rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental
Authority to control or regulate any of the Purchased Assets or the operations
of the Business or Facilities, and (B) rights under Applicable Law, including
any building or zoning ordinances, in each case that do not
materially interfere with, impede or impair the operation or value of the
Business, or the use of the Owned Refinery Real Property as currently
conducted by Seller;

(xii) Liens under existing leases, licenses and similar agreements to the
extent such constitute Assigned Contracts;

 

(xiii) acts done or suffered to be done by, and judgments against, Buyer or
its Affiliates and those claiming by, through or under Buyer or its
Affiliates;

(xiv) any agreement or contract entered into by the parties in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

(xv) all matters of record as of the Execution Date, but excluding
any monetary Liens, purchase options and rights of first refusal; or

(xvi) non-monetary Liens that do not materially interfere with, impede or
impair the operation or value of the Refinery or the Business as conducted by
Seller (clauses (i)-(xvi) of this Section 3.10(b) are, collectively, the
"Permitted Liens").

 

(c) Except for services provided pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, the Purchased Assets and the rights provided to Buyer pursuant to
Article 10 (subject to the limitations set forth therein) constitute all of
the material rights, property and assets of Seller or its Subsidiaries
necessary for the operation of the Business as currently conducted, subject
to any limitations, disclosures or disclaimers expressly stated in this
Agreement, and are generally adequate for the conduct of the Business as
currently conducted. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to obtain any
consent, approval, waiver or authorization required in connection with any
transfer or assignment to Buyer of a Purchased Asset shall not in and of
itself constitute a breach of this Section 3.10(c) or any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement. 

(d) There are no assets, contracts, licenses or permits which are material to
the Business that are used or held for use primarily but not exclusively in
connection with the Business, except for those assets, contracts, licenses or
permits set forth on Section 3.10(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule under
the heading "Non-Exclusive Assets". For the avoidance of doubt, all Refinery
Real Estate Interests and all tangible Equipment and inventories located at
the Facilities are used exclusively in the Business.

 

(e) Each of the Refinery Real Property Leases and Refinery Easements is a
valid and binding agreement of Seller or one of its Subsidiaries and is in
full force and effect, and none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto is in default or breach in
any respect under the terms of any such Refinery Real Property Lease or
Refinery Easement, except for any such failures to be valid and binding or in
full force and effect, defaults or breaches which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



42 (f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, Seller has not received any
written notice (i) for assessments for public improvements against any of the
Refinery Real Estate Interests, or (ii) regarding any pending condemnation,
eminent domain or similar proceeding affecting all or any portion of any of
the Refinery Real Estate Interests.

Section 3.11 _. Intellectual Property._ (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all material Owned Intellectual
Property Rights, including all registrations and applications for registration
included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights.

(b) Section 3.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all (i) agreements as to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party and pursuant to which any Person is authorized to use any material
Licensed Intellectual Property Right, including all such agreements for
processes which are used by Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
operation of the Refinery process units (the "Process Licenses"), and (ii)
material Licensed Intellectual Property Rights that are not licensable or
transferable without the consent of a third party.

(c) No Owned Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding
judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the use thereof
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Business or
restricting the licensing thereof by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person, except for any judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the conduct of the Business, as
currently conducted, does not infringe or otherwise violate the Intellectual
Property Rights of any Person and (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller, no Person
has infringed or otherwise violated any Owned Intellectual Property Right.

 

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no demand, claim, action, notice of
violation, legal proceeding or arbitration (each a "Claim") has been asserted
and is pending by any Person against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property Right or
the validity or effectiveness thereof, nor, to Sellers Knowledge, is there
any valid basis for the assertion of any of the foregoing.

 

(f) All fees, royalties and payments relating to the Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights due and payable by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Execution Date have been paid, except for those fees, royalties, and
payments the non-payment of which do not materially interfere, impair or
impede the operation or value of the Business. All fees, royalties
and payments relating to the Process Licenses due and payable by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the Execution Date have been paid. Seller has
fully paid up (as described below) Process Licenses for all active process
units incorporating third party technology (other than such technology which
is considered "open art") and such paid-up Process Licenses authorize the
operation of the process units at the highest throughput rates (measured on an
annualized basis) achieved during any of the most recent five calendar years
ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



43 Section 3.12 _. Insurance Coverage._ Seller and/or its Subsidiaries
maintain adequate insurance coverage in accordance with reasonable commercial

case in respect of the Purchased Assets and the business and operations of the
Business and its employees.

Section 3.13 _. Finders  Fees. _Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co., whose fees
will be paid by Seller, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries who as of the Execution Date are not actively at work, including
those who are on inactive employee status or leave of absence, separately
identifying those employees classified as Short-Term Inactive Employees and
those employees classified as Long-Term Inactive Employees and the respective
leave of absence beginning date.

(b) Other than the Collective Bargaining Agreement, there are no collective
bargaining agreements or other labor agreements with any union, labor
organization or employee association to which Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries are a party covering any Business Employees. Section 3.14(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth each material memoranda or letter of
understanding applicable to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. There are
no employment agreements (other than the Collective Bargaining Agreement)
governing the employment of any Business Employees. The Non-Represented
Employees are employed at will. To the Knowledge of Seller, (i) there are no
grievances pending pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement nor are
there any unfair labor practice charges or complaints pending before any
agency having jurisdiction over any of the Business Employees and Seller has
not received any notice that there are any union representation claims
involving any of the Business Employees and (ii) there is no effort, activity
or proceeding of any union, labor organization or employee association (or a

stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts with respect to Business Employees, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

related to the ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets or the
Business, except as would not be material to the Business.

(e) All wages, severance, commissions, incentive pay and bonuses earned and
payable to Business Employees for services performed on or prior to the
Execution Date have been paid in full or will be paid as soon as reasonably
practicable hereafter and there are no outstanding agreements, understandings
or commitments of Seller, except as provided in the Seller Plans, with
respect to any wages, severance, commissions, incentive pay, bonuses or

the Execution Date (but in any event within 5 days of the Execution Date),
Seller or its Subsidiaries shall provide notice of this Agreement to the other
parties to the Consent Decree. Seller or its Subsidiaries and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to make any changes to the Consent Decree
Modification mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer that are (A) appropriate
non-substantive form changes; or (B) if applicable, necessary to reflect only
the sale that is the subject of this Agreement and not the sale of that
certain refinery in Superior, Wisconsin. Seller or its Subsidiaries and Buyer
shall consult with the parties to the Consent Decree to confirm that those
parties have no objections to the Consent Decree Modification and, if
applicable, shall negotiate in good faith with such parties to resolve any
such objections. Upon obtaining such confirmation or making any changes
mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer (it being understood that none of
Seller, its Subsidiaries or Buyer is under any obligation to accept
additional substantive obligations, unless mutually acceptable to Seller and
Buyer) to address any objections by the parties to the Consent Decree, Seller
shall 

 



56  take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions (including those set
forth in Paragraph 7 of the Consent Decree) to have the Consent Decree
Modification entered by the Consent Decree Court, and Buyer shall take all
reasonable steps (including those set forth in paragraph 7 of the Consent
Decree provided it does not allocate liabilities in any way inconsistent with
Seller Consent Decree Obligations or Buyer Consent Decree Obligations, unless
mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer) to support Sellers or its
Subsidiaries actions to have the Consent Decree Modification entered by the
Consent Decree Court, including supporting Sellers and its
Subsidiaries efforts to be released from the Buyer Consent Decree
Obligations, and to demonstrate to the Consent Decree Court and the other
parties to the Consent Decree that Buyer has the financial and technical
ability to assume the Buyer Consent Decree Obligations. On and after the
Closing, Buyer shall (i) satisfy, perform and assume all Buyer Consent Decree
Obligations and (ii) provide Seller with reasonable access and cooperation to
enable Seller to satisfy and perform, at Sellers expense, any Seller Consent
Decree Obligations. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 7.05(b) to
the contrary, Buyer is, with respect to the Consent Decree, assuming only the
Buyer Consent Decree Obligations and is not assuming any obligation of the
Seller that, absent broad assumption language in the Consent Decree or the
Consent Decree Modification, would be a Seller Consent Decree Obligation.

 

(c) _Fuels Compliance_. From and after Closing, for fuels shipped on and after
Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for all Fuel Compliance Obligations,
including any Fuels Credits and Fuel Credit deficits attributable to fuels
shipped on and after Closing. For fuels shipped prior to Closing, Seller shall
be responsible for all Fuel Compliance Obligations, including any Fuels
Credits and any Fuels Credit deficits that may exist attributable to fuels
shipped before Closing (such obligations of Seller, "Pre-Closing Fuel
Compliance Obligations"). After the Inventory Statement is finalized pursuant
to Section 2.08(d), Seller or its Subsidiaries shall submit by the relevant
deadline all filings required by the Fuel Regulations or necessary to balance
any Fuels Credit deficits to the extent associated with the Pre-Closing Fuel
Compliance Obligations, and shall provide a copy, or other such proof, of each
such filing to Buyer.

 

Section 7.06. _Title Policies._ (a) On or before the Execution Date, Seller
has delivered to Buyer the Title Commitments and made available to Buyer
copies of Sellers or its Subsidiaries existing title insurance policies with
respect to the Buffer Property and the Office Properties. Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall execute and deliver to the Title Company such affidavits,
certificates and other documentation as are reasonably requested to cause the
Title Company to issue (i) the Title Policy for the Refinery Real Estate
Interests and (ii) title insurance policies with respect to the
Buffer Property and Office Properties; _provided_ that nothing in such
affidavits, certificates or documentation shall require Seller or its
Subsidiaries to incur any liabilities or obligations to any Person that are
not otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. The above
notwithstanding, as to Parcel 2, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall deliver any
maps or execute and deliver to the Title Company such affidavits,
certificates, indemnities and other documentation as are reasonably requested
to cause the Title Company to issue the Title Policy for the Refinery Real
Estate Interests which show that Parcel 2 is contiguous to the other tracts
which make up the Refinery Real Estate Interests and lies substantially in the
location depicted for Parcel 2 on the map prepared by SunCoast Land Services,
Inc. as set forth on Section 3.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(depicted as "Tract 8" on said map). Seller agrees to cooperate with and
assist Buyer with any reasonable request in Buyers efforts to

 



57  obtain the Title Policy and any such other title insurance policies. The
above notwithstanding, Seller shall either (i) cause any Intervening Monetary
Lien or Schedule B1 Item l Lien to be released of record by payment, bonding
or otherwise or (ii) cause the Title Company to insure in the Title Policy
against any Intervening Monetary Lien. "Intervening Monetary Lien" means (x)
any mortgage or deed to trust Lien or other monetary Lien that encumbers any
portion of the Refinery Real Estate Interests, or (y) any mechanics,
materialmens or similar Lien, in each case that appears of record between the
date of the Title Commitment and the Closing Date.

(b) Seller shall not be obligated to provide any new or updated surveys of any
of the Owned Refinery Real Property and Refinery Easements, and Buyers
receipt of any such surveys shall not constitute a condition to Closing or
form the basis for delaying Closing; however, Seller agrees to reasonably
cooperate with Buyer prior to Closing to permit Buyer to attempt to procure
any surveys of the Owned Refinery Real Property and Refinery Easements that
Buyer deems reasonably necessary and to the extent Seller has such right to
grant access, all at Buyers sole cost and expense.

Section 7.07 _. Litigation Cooperation._ (a) In connection with the defense or
prosecution of any suit, action or proceeding relating to an Assumed
Liability or an Retained Liability (but subject to the provisions of Article
13 in the event indemnification is being sought thereunder pursuant to any
applicable provision of this Agreement) each party, at its own cost and
expense, shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such suit, action or proceeding,
(ii) furnish or cause to be furnished such documents, records, information
and testimony, grant or cause to be granted access to all reasonably requested
witnesses, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, in each case as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith and (iii) take all reasonable steps to make available to
the other parties, upon written request, its former and current employees,
other personnel and agents (whether as witnesses or otherwise) to the extent
that such persons may reasonably be required in connection therewith.

(b) Neither Seller nor Buyer will (and each of Seller and Buyer shall cause
its respective Affiliates not to) destroy or dispose of any documents, records
or information that a party may have the right to obtain pursuant to Section
7.07 without first using reasonable efforts to notify the applicable other
party of the proposed destruction or disposition and giving such other party
the opportunity to take possession of or copy such documents, records or
information prior to such destruction or disposition.

 

Section 7.08 _. Contact with Customers and Vendors._ Without prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), and unless otherwise (and to the extent) in connection with
the business activities of Buyer not otherwise related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, prior to
the Closing Date, contact any customer, vendor, supplier or employee of, or
any other Person having business dealings with, Seller or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Business or with respect to any aspect of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement; _provided_ that Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate in contacting, prior to the Closing Date, customers and
suppliers of the Business as reasonably necessary for the purposes of
transferring or establishing credit and related security arrangements.

 



58 Section 7.09. _Foreign Trade Zone_. Seller has operated the Refinery
as Foreign-Trade Zone Subzone No. 2 (the "FTZ"). The FTZ is operating under a
grant of authority from the Foreign-Trade Zones Board of the Department of
Commerce ("FTZ Board"), and has been activated with U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (previously the U.S. Customs Service) ("Customs"). Prior to or upon
Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make all
necessary notifications (including notifications to the FTZ Board and
Customs) to enable Buyer to continue operating the Refinery as a FTZ, and
Buyer shall (i) cooperate with and assist Seller in connection with the
foregoing and (ii) promptly reimburse Seller for any duties, fees and expenses
paid by Seller in connection therewith. Additionally, upon Closing, Seller
shall reconcile all foreign inventories and shall be liable and pay all
outstanding foreign duties relating to inventory in the FTZ prior to Closing.
Upon Closing and until reactivation or transfer of the FTZ to Buyer or
Buyers Affiliate (but in any event not later than one year after the Closing
Date), Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain current
FTZ status, including all operational, reporting and filing requirements as
part of the transition services under the Transition Services Agreement;
_provided_ that Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its
Subsidiaries harmless from any and all Damages incurred by Seller or its
Subsidiaries arising out of Sellers operation of the FTZ from and after
Closing pursuant to this sentence and shall promptly reimburse Seller for any
duties, fees and expenses paid by Seller in connection therewith. Both
parties shall fully cooperate to facilitate the prompt transfer of the FTZ to
Buyer or Buyers Affiliate.

Section 7.10 _. CAM Pipeline Easement._ At or as promptly as practicable
after Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a duly executed CAM Pipeline
Easement; _provided_ that failure to so deliver the CAM Pipeline Easement
shall not impact Sellers continued ownership, use or operation of the CAM
Pipeline after Closing as provided by Applicable Law. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyers delivery of the CAM Pipeline Easement shall be at no cost to
Seller (except that Seller shall bear the fees and expenses incurred by it in
preparing and recording the CAM Pipeline Easement).

ARTICLE 8

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01 _. Tax Cooperation; Allocation of Taxes._ (a) Buyer and Seller
agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Business and the Purchased Assets (including access to books and records) as
is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax returns, the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax. Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with
respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased Assets until 60 days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, taking into account
any extensions that have been granted. On or after the end of such period,
each party shall provide the other with at least 30 days prior written notice
before destroying any such books and records, during which period the party
receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of
such books and records. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the
Purchased Assets or the Business.

 



59 (b) All real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar ad
valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable
period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively,
the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer
based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period after the
Closing Date (any such portion of such taxable period, the "Post-Closing Tax
Period"). Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such taxes
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such taxes that is attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(c) All excise, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, franchise, property and transfer Taxes (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller other than Transfer Taxes
imposed on the sale of the Hydrocarbon Inventory. All state and local sales
and use taxes ("Sales and Use Taxes") imposed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all Transfer Taxes imposed on
the sale of the Hydrocarbon Inventory shall be borne solely and exclusively
by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in securing and providing each
other with any appropriate resale exemption certifications, licenses and other
similar documentation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
later than 5 Business Days prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller
either (i) each of the items set forth in Section 8.01(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or (ii) in the case of any such item that has not
yet been obtained, documentation that establishes to Sellers satisfaction
that Buyer has completed the necessary filings in order to secure an effective
date for such item that is no later than the Closing Date (the
"Filing Documentation"). In any case in which, as of the Closing Date, Buyer
has not delivered to Seller either any item set forth in Section 8.01(c) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the corresponding Filing Documentation,
Buyer shall pay to Seller at Closing an amount equal to the Transfer Taxes
and Sales and Use Taxes that Seller expects to be imposed on the sale of the
Hydrocarbon Inventory (the "Initial Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount"), with
the amount of such payment to be determined as follows: (x) the portion of
the Initial Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount comprising Transfer Taxes shall
be the amount of Transfer Taxes Seller expects will be imposed on the
estimated volume of the Hydrocarbon Inventory and (y) the portion comprising
Sales and Use Taxes shall be the amount of Sales and Use Taxes Seller expects
will be imposed on the Estimated Inventory Value, each as determined pursuant
to Section 2.08. If, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.08(e),
it is determined that the estimated volume of the Hydrocarbon Inventory is
more or less than the volume of the Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Closing
Date and/or the Estimated Inventory Value is more or less than the Inventory
Value, (x) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of any resulting net increase
in the aggregate Transfer Taxes and Sales and Use Taxes imposed on the sale of
the Hydrocarbon Inventory at Closing or, as applicable, (y) Seller shall pay
to Buyer the amount of any resulting net overpayment of the aggregate Transfer
Taxes and Sales and Use Taxes imposed on the sale of the Hydrocarbon Inventory
at Closing, in each case at the same time and subject to the same interest
provisions as the amounts described in Section 2.08(e). In addition, within 10
days of receipt by Seller of any refund in respect of (i) the Initial

 



60  Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount and (ii) any additional amounts actually
paid by Buyer pursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, Seller shall
pay to Buyer the amount of such refund. Any subsequent adjustments to any
Transfer Tax or Sales and Use Tax made pursuant to a legally prescribed audit,
and any costs incurred with respect to such audit, shall be apportioned as
provided in this Section 8.01(c). For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be
solely responsible for any Transfer Taxes related to any transaction
associated with the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Businesses.

 

(d) Apportioned Obligations and Taxes described in Section 8.01(c) shall be
timely paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed,
as provided by Applicable Law. Upon payment of any such Apportioned Obligation
or Tax described in 8.01(c), the paying party shall present a statement to the
non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the
paying party is entitled under Section 8.01(b) or (c), as the case may be
together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate
the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such
reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 10 days after the
presentation of such statement. Any payment not made within such time shall
bear interest at a rate equal to the Interest Rate for each day until paid.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 9.01 _. Offers of Employment; Assumption of Collective Bargaining
Agreements._ (a) Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to), on or
prior to the Closing Date, make an offer of employment to (i) each Business
Employee who is a Represented Employee other than Long-Term Inactive Employees
and Short Term Inactive Employees, except as set forth in Section 9.01(c) and
(ii) each Business Employee who is a Non-Represented Employee other than
Long-Term Inactive Employees and Short-Term Inactive Employees except as set
forth in Section 9.01(c). Unless a written acceptance of an offer of
employment is required by Applicable Law, a Business Employee in the
categories set forth in (i) and (ii) above who continues employment shall be
deemed to have accepted such offer of employment, unless such Business
Employee specifically declines such offer of employment. Business Employees
as described above who accept (or are deemed to have accepted) such offer of
employment and who commence active employment with Buyer as of the applicable
Transfer Date (as defined below) shall be a "Transferred Employee"
and collectively the "Transferred Employees." The date on which a Transferred
Employee commences active employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates, as
applicable, shall be the effective date of his or her employment with Buyer
and is hereafter referred to as that Transferred Employees "Transfer Date").

(b) Seller shall assume or retain responsibility and liability, if any, for
any and all Business Employees who receive an offer of employment consistent
with the terms of Section 9.02 but who decline such offer.

 



61 (c) Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to), on or prior to the
Closing Date, make an offer of employment to each Short-Term Inactive
Employee, on terms set forth in Section 9.02, and contingent on such Short-
Term Inactive Employee returning to active employment on or prior to the later
of (i) the sixth month anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the latest
date on which the Buyer would be required to rehire such Short-Term Inactive
Employee pursuant to Applicable Law or the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as
it may be modified. 

(d) The provisions of this Section 9.01 do not create any new or additional
right or expectation of continued employment for Represented Employees or
Non-Represented Employees.

(e) Buyer agrees (i) to be the successor company or successor operator as
those terms are used under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, (ii) to
provide any and all compensation and benefits required under the Collective
Bargaining Agreement, from and after Closing until the expiration of the
remaining contractual term of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement,
(iii) otherwise to be bound by, and comply with all of the terms and
conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the
remaining contractual term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, (iv) to
recognize the Union as the exclusive representative of the Transferred
Employees who are Represented Employees and covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreement for the remaining contractual term of the Collective
Bargaining Agreement, and (v) to execute and deliver on or prior to the
Closing all documentation and agreements required to effectuate the foregoing.

 

(f) Seller shall, promptly, but in no event later than 10 Business Days, after
the Execution Date, provide Buyer with employment data, including the name,
title, years of service, date of hire, current salary, bonus and incentive
opportunity, credited and unused vacation and/or sick pay, exempt or non-
exempt status and the job grade of each Business Employee. 

Section 9.02 _. Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits._ (a) Buyer shall
cause to be provided to each Transferred Employee who is a Represented
Employee for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date (the "Relevant
Period"), or the remaining contractual term of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement, whichever is shorter, (i) an annual base salary which is at least
equal to that offered by Seller to such Transferred Employee prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) benefits pursuant to Buyers employee benefit plans
("Buyers Plans"). The terms of the benefits under the Buyers Plans
applicable to each such Transferred Employee, shall be, in the aggregate,
reasonably comparable to those offered by Seller to such Transferred Employee
prior to the Closing Date, except that Buyer shall be entitled to establish
such benefits as may be allowed by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

(b) Buyer shall cause to be provided to each Transferred Employee who is a
Non-Represented Employee for the Relevant Period (i) an annual base salary
which is at least equal to that offered by the Seller to such Transferred
Employee prior to such employees Transfer Date and an annual cash bonus
which is at least equal to that offered by the Seller to such Transferred
Employee prior to such employees Transfer Date but not greater than such cash
bonus offer to other comparable jobs of the Buyer and its Affiliates, and
(ii) benefits pursuant to Buyers Plans. The terms of the Buyers Plans
applicable to each such Transferred Employee, shall be, in the aggregate,
reasonably comparable to those offered by the Seller to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



62 Section 9.03 _. Defined Contribution Plans._ (a) As of the Transfer
Date, Buyer shall cover (or cause to be covered) each Transferred Employee
who elects to enroll under the Buyers defined contribution plan, which is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and their related trusts
(collectively, the "Buyer DC Plan") on a basis reasonably comparable in the
aggregate when considering all Buyers Plans to the basis on which they
participated in any defined contribution plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code and its related trust that is sponsored by Seller
or any of its Affiliates in respect of Transferred Employees (collectively,
the "Seller DC Plan") when considering all Sellers Plans, and on terms that
reflect the service credit provisions of Section 9.06. Effective as of the
Transfer Date, each Transferred Employee shall cease to be an active
participant in the Seller DC Plan. Effective as of the Transfer Date,
Transferred Employees shall be eligible to effect a "direct rollover" (as
described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of their account balances under
the Seller DC Plan to the Buyer DC Plan in the form of cash.

 

Section 9.04 _. Defined Benefit Plans._ (a) With respect to the Seller Plans
that are defined benefit plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code, which cover both Represented and Non-Represented Employees (the
"Seller DB Plans"), each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the
Seller DB Plans shall cease to participate in the Seller DB Plans as of his
or her Transfer Date; _provided_ at such time, such Transferred Employee shall
be fully vested in his or her accrued benefits under the Seller DB Plans.
Seller shall retain all assets and liabilities thereunder, including
responsibility for all benefits accrued to each such Transferred Employee in
respect of the period prior to the Transfer Date under the terms of the Seller
DB Plans.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Transfer Date but effective as of the
Transfer Date, Buyer shall cover (or cause to be covered) each Transferred
Employee under Buyers defined benefit pension plans intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code and its related trust (collectively, the "Buyer DB
Plan") on a basis reasonably comparable in the aggregate, when considering
all Buyers Plans to the basis on which they participated in the Seller DB
Plan when considering all Sellers Plans, and on terms that reflect the
service credit provisions of Section 9.06 hereof.

Section 9.05 _. Welfare Plans; ESPP._ (a) As of the applicable Transfer Date,
each Transferred Employee shall cease participation in the health and welfare
benefit plans of Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "Seller Welfare Plan") and
commence participation in the health and welfare benefit plans maintained,
administered or contributed to by Buyer or its Affiliates. Seller and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for claims incurred under a Seller Welfare
Plan for all Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents
prior to the Transfer Date.

 

(b) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to) cover each Transferred
Employee who elects to enroll under one or more of Buyers health and welfare
benefit plans (collectively, the "Buyer Welfare Plan") on a basis reasonably
comparable in the aggregate, when considering all Buyers Plans, to the basis
on which they participated in the Seller Welfare Plan when considering all
Sellers Plans, and on terms that reflect the service credit provisions of
Section 9.06 hereof. Buyer or its Affiliates shall be responsible for all
claims incurred under a Buyer Welfare Plan for all Transferred Employees and
their beneficiaries and dependents effective on

 



63  the Transfer Date _provided_ the Transferred Employee enrolls in the Buyer
Welfare Plan. Buyer shall also (or shall cause its Affiliates to) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Transferred Employees under any health and welfare plans in which such
Transferred Employees are eligible to participate as of their Transfer Date
to the extent that such limitations were waived under the applicable Seller
Welfare Plan.

(c) As of the Transfer Date, Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees to
participate in one or more medical and dependent care account plans
established or designated by Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer FSA Plan").

 

(d) (i) Seller shall have sole responsibility for "continuation coverage"
benefits for any Transferred Employee and all "qualified beneficiaries" of
any Transferred Employee for whom a "qualifying event" occurs prior to the
Transfer Date (including all qualifying events that occur in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii)
Buyer shall have sole responsibility for "continuation coverage" benefits for
any Transferred Employee and all "qualified beneficiaries" of any Transferred
Employee for whom a "qualifying event" occurs at or after the Transfer Date.
The terms "continuation coverage," "qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying
event" shall have the meanings ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the
Code and Sections 601-608 of ERISA.

(e) The treatment of the accounts of each Transferred Employee participating
in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Murphy Oil Corporation immediately
prior to the Closing shall be determined by the terms of such plan.

Section 9.06 _. Credit for Past Service._ (a) Except to the extent otherwise
required by the Collective Bargaining Agreement or applicable memoranda or
letters of understanding, Buyer shall ensure that all of Buyers Plans in
which the Transferred Employees who are Represented Employees participate
after the Transfer Date recognize the years of service with the Seller and/or
its Affiliates and predecessor employers prior to the Transfer Date of such
Transferred Employees (such past service as reflected in the employment data
furnished to Buyer pursuant to Section 9.01(f)) for eligibility, and vesting
to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, before the
Transfer Date, to credit for such service under any similar Seller Plans, but
Buyer shall have no obligation to recognize such years of service for benefit
accrual purposes other than in respect of computing paid time off and, where
applicable, severance.

(b) Buyer shall ensure that all of Buyers Plans in which the Transferred
Employees who are Non-Represented Employees participate after the Transfer
Date recognize the years of service with the Seller and/or its Affiliates and
predecessor employers prior to the Transfer Date of any such Transferred
Employees (such past service as reflected in the employment data furnished to
Buyer pursuant to Section 9.01(f)) for eligibility and vesting to the same
extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, before the Transfer Date, to
credit for such service under any similar Sellers Plans, but Buyer shall
have no obligation to recognize such years of service for benefit accrual
purposes other than in respect of computing paid time off and where
applicable, severance.

 



64 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to a Transferred Employees
participation in Buyers DB Plan, Buyer will recognize a Transferred
Employees years of service with the Seller and/or its Affiliates for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and the calculation of pay credits.

 

Section 9.07 _. Severance._ Any Transferred Employee who is a Non-Represented
Employee and is terminated other than for cause (as reasonably determined in
the sole discretion of Buyer) during the Relevant Period and any Business
Employee who rejects an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its
Affiliates at Closing, or at a later Transfer Date, because such offer
of employment did not meet the requirements of Section 9.02, shall be
entitled to severance from Buyer in an amount equal to what he or she would
have received under the applicable severance plan or policy of Seller (as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing and taking into account the service
credit provision of Section 9.06 and any post-Closing service with Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, a copy of which has been included as Section 9.07 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule); assuming for purposes of this Section 9.07
that such Transferred Employee or Business Employee had satisfied any
requirements for the receipt of severance under such plan or policy and
provided that such Transferred Employee or Business Employee executes,
delivers and does not revoke a general release in favor of Seller, Buyer and
their respective Affiliates. Buyer agrees that after the expiration of the
Relevant Period, any Transferred Employee who is a Non-Represented
Employee shall be covered by the severance plan or other similar policy then
in effect, if any, for similarly situated employees of Buyer. Any Transferred
Employee who is a Represented Employee shall continue to be subject to any
applicable termination allowance provisions of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement for the remaining contractual term of the current Collective
Bargaining Agreement.

Section 9.08 _. Retiree Medical Benefits._

(a) Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all post-retirement
medical, dental and life insurance ("Seller Retiree Welfare Benefit") coverage
for any Business Employees who satisfy the eligibility requirements for Seller
Retiree Welfare Benefit under the applicable plan prior to the Transfer Date
and retire from Seller prior to the Transfer Date (the "Retired Business
Employees"). Any Retired Business Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee
will not be eligible to participate in Buyers post-retirement medical,
dental and life insurance plan ("Buyer Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan"). Any
Retiree Eligible Represented Employee and any other Represented Employee who
becomes a Transferred Employee will be eligible to participate in the Buyer
Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan on the Transfer Date (provided that the Transfer
Date for such Retiree Eligible Represented Employee occurs prior to the stated
termination date for the Collective Bargaining Agreement), subject to any
applicable retiree health and welfare provisions of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement for the remaining contractual term of the current Collective
Bargaining Agreement. Any Non-Represented Employee who does not retire from
Seller prior to the Transfer Date and becomes a Transferred Employee will be
eligible to participate in the Buyer Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan subject to
the terms and conditions of such Buyer Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan, giving
effect to the service credit provisions of Section 9.06. For the avoidance of
doubt, except as required by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Buyer shall
not be obligated to provide retiree welfare benefits to Transferred Employees
to the extent Buyer does not provide retiree welfare benefits to similarly
situated employees of Buyer.

 



65 (b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted for the Retiree Medical
Adjustment Amount in accordance with Section 2.06(a).

Section 9.09 _. Workers  Compensation. _Buyers workers compensation
program shall be responsible for all claims for benefits that are based upon
events occurring at or after Transfer Date by participating Transferred
Employees. Sellers workers compensation program shall be responsible for
all claims for benefits that are based upon events occurring prior to Transfer
Date by participating Transferred Employees.

Section 9.10 _. Withholding._ Buyer and Seller agree to comply with the
Standard Procedure described in Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2
C.B. 320 (the "Standard Procedure"). Seller shall, in accordance with Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, assume all responsibility for preparing and filing Form
W-2, Wage and Tax Statements; Form W-3, Transmittal of Income and Tax
Statements; Form 941, Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Returns; Form W-4,
Employees Withholding Allowance Certificates; and Form W-5, Earned Income
Credit Advance Payment Certificates (collectively, the "Employee Withholding
Documents") with regard to wages paid to Transferred Employees through their
respective Transfer Date. Buyer shall assume all responsibility for preparing
and filing the Employee Withholding Documents with regard to wages paid to
Transferred Employees after their respective Transfer Date. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith to the extent necessary to permit each of them
to comply with the Standard Procedure.

Section 9.11 _. Allocation of Certain Liabilities._ (a) (i) Buyer shall be
solely responsible for all liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) for all employment and other claims by
any Transferred Employees with respect to events or circumstances arising and
asserted after the Transfer Date relating to arbitrations, unfair labor
practice charges, employment discrimination charges, wrongful termination
claims, workers compensation claims, any employment-related tort claim or
other similar claims or charges of or by any Transferred Employee, and (ii)
Seller shall be solely responsible for all liabilities, obligations, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) for all employment or
other claims by any Transferred Employees with respect to events or
circumstances arising before Transfer Date relating to arbitrations, unfair
labor practice charges, employment discrimination charges, wrongful
termination claims, workers compensation claims, any employment-related tort
claim or other similar claims or charges of or by any Transferred Employee,
except for any claim based on a statement or written promise made by Buyer as
to any entitlement at or after Transfer Date.

(b) Seller shall retain and be solely liable for (i) all liabilities,
obligations and expenses in respect of Excluded Employees, and Business
Employees and former Business Employees who do not become Transferred
Employees hereunder, except as expressly provided in this Article 9, and (ii)
except as with respect to vacation time to the extent credited by Buyer, all
liabilities, obligations and expenses for compensation and benefits of a
Transferred Employee relating to periods prior to the Transfer Date.

 



66 Section 9.12 _. Vacation._ Seller represents that it does not allow the
Business Employees to bank or carry-over vacation. Prior to Closing, but in
no event earlier than 5 days prior to Closing, Seller will provide to Buyer a
list of its credited vacation entitlement for the Business Employees. Earned
and credited vacation liabilities of Transferred Employees for the calendar
year in which Closing occurs (the "Closing Year") will be calculated as
follows: the days during the Closing Year that Seller owned the Business will
be calculated, as will the number of days Buyer will own the Business.
Fractions will be calculated in which the numerators will be the number of
days during the Closing Year that Seller owned the Business, and the number of
days during the Closing Year that Buyer will own the Business, respectively,
and the denominators will be the number of days in the year of the Closing
Year. These fractions will be multiplied by the number of eligibility hours of
vacation entitlement for Transferred Employees on the Closing Date, whether
already taken or not. The resulting calculation will yield the number of hours
of vacation attributable to the account of both Buyer and Seller. To the
extent the total actual remaining vacation entitlement to be taken in the
Closing Year by Transferred Employees is greater than the total number of
vacation hours attributable to Buyer, the Purchase Price will be reduced in
accordance with Section 2.06(a) by the dollar amount of the difference. To the
extent that the total actual remaining vacation entitlement to be taken in
the Closing Year by Transferred Employees is less than the total number of
vacation hours attributable to Buyer, the Purchase Price will be increased in
accordance with Section 2.06(a) by the dollar amount of the difference. This
dollar amount will be calculated by multiplying the total number of vacation
hours (by which the total actual remaining vacation entitlement to be taken in
the Closing Year exceeds (or is less than) the total number of vacation hours
attributable to Buyer or Seller in the Closing Year) by the average hourly
rate (based on an individual-by-individual rate analysis) or the average staff
employee rate (based on an individual-by-individual rate analysis).
The adjustment for accrued vacation set forth in this Section shall be
referred to as the "Accrued Vacation Adjustment."

Section 9.13 _. Employee Communications._ Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in
communications with Business Employees with respect to employee benefit plans
maintained by Seller or Buyer and with respect to other matters arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 9.14 _. Acknowledgement._ Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that
nothing contained in this Article 9 shall be construed to limit in any way the
ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Transferred Employee from and after the Transfer Date or the Relevant Period,
as applicable, under the provisions of this Article 9.

Section 9.15 _. No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Without limiting the
generality of Section 13.08, no provision of this Article 9 shall (a) create
any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or its Affiliates,
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any other Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (b) constitute
or create or be deemed to constitute or create an employment agreement or (c)
constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates or Buyer or its
Affiliates.

 



67 Section 9.16 _. Cooperation._ Each of Buyer and Seller recognize it to be in
the best interests of the parties hereto and their respective employees that
the transactions in this Article 9 be effected in an orderly manner and agree
to devote their respective best efforts and to cooperate fully in complying
with the provisions of this Article 9. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree to execute, deliver and file all documents
and to take all such actions as are deemed necessary or desirable in order to
carry out and perform the purposes of this Article 9 and to facilitate the
transactions referred to in this Article 9.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS

 

Section 10.01. Shared Owned IPR License Grant. Effective as of Closing, Seller
grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, fully
paid up license (without a right to sublicense or transfer except as otherwise
set forth in Section 10.02) to use the Shared Owned IPR which is in use in the
operation of the Business as currently operated or as operated as of the
Execution Date (the "Shared Owned IPR License"). Buyer shall have no
obligation to grant back to Seller or its Affiliates or otherwise make
available to Seller or any of its Affiliates any improvements or enhancement
to any Shared Owned IPR that may be developed by Buyer following the Closing.

Section 10.02 _. Subsequent Transfer of Shared Owned IPR License._ In the
event that Buyer sells, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of the
Business to another Person, or in the event of a merger of Buyer with, or
acquisition of Buyer or all or substantially all of the assets of Buyer by,
another Person, the Shared Owned IPR License may be transferred, sublicensed
or assigned to such Person (a "Permitted Transferee") subject to such Persons
assumption in writing of all applicable related duties and obligations of
Buyer set forth in this Agreement and such Shared Owned IPR License;
_provided_ that no such assumption shall relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder.

 

Section 10.03 _. Licensed Intellectual Property Rights._ (a) With respect to
any Business License Agreement:

 

(i) If such Business License Agreement is transferable without the consent of,
or any payment to, any third party, Seller shall transfer such Business
License Agreement to Buyer at Closing as an Assigned Contract.

(ii) If such Business License Agreement is not transferable in accordance
with Section 10.03(a)(i), Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to obtain consent
from the applicable Licensor to Sellers transfer of such Business License
Agreement to Buyer, effective as of Closing, on commercially reasonable
terms, and to the extent such consent is obtained, such Business License
Agreement shall transfer to Buyer at Closing as an Assigned Contract.

 



68 (iii) If Seller and Buyer are unable to effect the transfer of such
Business License Agreement pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(i) or Section
10.03(a)(ii), Seller shall sublicense to Buyer, effective as of Closing, any
Licensed Intellectual Property Right licensed under such Business License
Agreement to the extent such Licensed Intellectual Property Right is
licensable without the consent of, or any payment to, any third party.

(iv) If Seller and Buyer are unable to effect a transfer of such Business
License Agreement pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(i) or Section 10.03(a)(ii) or a
sublicense of any Licensed Intellectual Property Right licensed under such
Business License Agreement pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(iii), Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate to obtain, at Buyers election and in each case on
commercially reasonable terms and effective as of Closing, either a new
agreement with the applicable Licensor for Buyers use of such Licensed
Intellectual Property Right or consent from such Licensor to Sellers
sublicense of such Licensed Intellectual Property Right to Buyer.

 

(b) With respect to any Shared License Agreement:

 

(i) At Buyers election, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to obtain a new
agreement ( _i.e_., split the Shared License Agreement so that Buyer receives
its own agreement) on commercially reasonable terms with the applicable
Licensor, effective as of Closing, for Buyers use of any Licensed
Intellectual Property Right licensed under such Shared Licensed Agreement.

(ii) If Buyer does not elect to attempt to obtain, or Buyer is unable to
obtain, a new agreement in accordance with Section 10.03(b)(i), Seller shall
sublicense to Buyer, effective as of Closing, any Licensed Intellectual
Property Right licensed under such Shared Licensed Agreement to the extent
such Licensed Intellectual Property Right is licensable without the consent
of, or any payment to, any third party.

(iii) If Seller and Buyer are unable to effect a new agreement pursuant to
Section 10.03(b)(i) or a sublicense of any Licensed Intellectual Property
Right licensed under such Shared License Agreement pursuant to Section
10.03(b)(ii), Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to obtain consent from the
applicable Licensor to Sellers sublicense of such Licensed Intellectual
Property Right to Buyer, effective as of Closing, on commercially reasonable
terms.

 

(c) In any event in which Seller and Buyer are required to cooperate by this
Section 10.03, Seller shall make the initial request to the applicable
Licensor for consent or a new agreement, as the case may be. Seller and Buyer
shall each pay one-half of any fees payable to any Licensor to the extent
directly attributable to obtaining such Licensors consent or a new agreement
with such Licensor, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 10.03
(except that Buyer shall pay 100% of any fees payable to any Licensor to
obtain a consent or new agreement for any of the agreements listed in Section
3.04(c) (Item 31) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule); _provided_ that any
payments, fees or costs associated with any extension or modification of any
Licensed Intellectual Property Right (including, in the case of any
new agreement, any payments, fees or costs associated with Buyers right to
use such Licensed Intellectual Property Right in any manner or at any time not
permitted of Seller under the applicable License Agreement) shall be borne
exclusively by Buyer.

 



69 (d) Seller shall be responsible for all accrued and unpaid royalties
arising and due under any License Agreement prior to Closing including any
payments, fees or costs payable for excess throughput (measured on a calendar
year basis) for any calendar year ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

(e) In connection with any sublicense granted by Seller pursuant to Section
10.03(a) or Section 10.03(b) (an "LIPR Sublicense"), in the event that (i)
Buyer breaches any of the terms and conditions set forth in the License
Agreement granting Seller or an Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, a
license to the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights sublicensed to Buyer
pursuant to such LIPR Sublicense, (ii) such breach would give the Licensor the
right to terminate such License Agreement, and (iii) such breach is not
completely and fully cured within the lesser of (A) the cure period, if any,
applicable to such breach set forth in such License Agreement, and (B) 45 days
after notice to Buyer identifying such breach, Seller shall have the right to
terminate such LIPR Sublicense immediately upon notice to Buyer. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event of any such breach by Buyer, if such License
Agreement does not provide for a cure period for such breach prior to
Licensors termination of a license to a Licensed Intellectual
Property Right, Buyer shall not be entitled to any cure period in respect of
such breach prior to termination of the LIPR Sublicense for such Licensed
Intellectual Property Right. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.03(e)
to the contrary, Buyer shall at all times comply with the terms and
conditions of the License Agreements to the extent applicable to the Licensed
Intellectual Property Rights sublicensed to Buyer pursuant to an LIPR
Sublicense and shall reimburse Seller for any amounts paid by Seller to the
Licensor to the extent in respect of Buyers use of the Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights, other than royalty payments and any other amount which Seller
is obligated to pay pursuant to Section 10.03(d) ("Pass-Through Payments").
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any such Pass-Through Payments within 30 days
of Sellers payments of such amounts and notice to Buyer thereof. Each LIPR
Sublicense shall be non-exclusive, non-transferable (except to a Permitted
Transferee in accordance with Section 10.02 hereof to the extent permitted by
the applicable License Agreement), non-sublicensable (except to a Permitted
Transferee in accordance with Section 10.02 hereof to the extent permitted by
the applicable License Agreement), fully paid-up (except to the extent Buyer
is required to make any payments pursuant to this Agreement), irrevocable
(except to the extent (i) Seller has the express right to terminate such LIPR
Sublicense pursuant to this Section 10.03, or (ii) the Licensor has the right
to revoke or terminate the applicable license) and limited to the current use
of the applicable Licensed Intellectual Property Right in the conduct of the
Business and the term during which Seller is permitted to grant such LIPR
Sublicense.

(f) With respect to all payment obligations to a Licensor under any License
Agreement under which Seller licenses any Licensed Intellectual Property
Rights that it sublicenses to Buyer pursuant to an LIPR Sublicense, or any
other obligation which gives such Licensor the right to terminate such
License Agreement, Seller agrees (subject to Sellers right to reimbursement
of the Pass-Through Payments and Buyers compliance with the obligations it is
required to comply with under such License Agreement) to pay the amounts due
pursuant to such payment obligations to such Licensor when due and otherwise
comply with such other obligations in accordance with the terms of such
License Agreement. If Seller fails to comply with the foregoing sentence,
Buyer shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to tender to such
Licensor sums or take such other action as is reasonably necessary to cure the
default and Seller

 



70  shall reimburse Buyer within 30 days of request therefor for all sums
reasonably expended by Buyer to cure the same (net of any Pass Through
Payments that Buyer would have been required to pay to Seller pursuant to
Section 10.03(e) had Seller complied with the foregoing sentence).

(g) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall have no obligation to
transfer, license or sublicense to Buyer any of the software applications
listed in Section 10.03(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Excluded
Software"). 

Section 10.04 _. Restrictions on Disclosure of Intellectual Property Rights_.
Buyer shall not disclose to any Person any Licensed Intellectual Property
Right sublicensed by Seller to Buyer, except (i) to the extent necessary to
exercise any LIPR Sublicense or (ii) to any Affiliate or a Permitted
Transferee, _provided_ that in each such case, (A) the party to whom
disclosure is made agrees to be bound by these confidentiality obligations and
(B) such disclosure may be made only to the extent not prohibited by any
License Agreement.

 

Section 10.05. _Improvements._ For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be
entitled to receive, and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation
to provide, any improvements, modifications, enhancements or upgrades
("Improvements") made following the Closing Date by Seller or its Subsidiaries
to any Intellectual Property Rights. 

Section 10.06 _. Reservation of Rights._ Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the Shared Owned IPR License and any LIPR Sublicense are the only
licenses and sublicenses granted herein to Buyer with respect to any
Intellectual Property Rights and (ii) no other licenses or sublicenses
whatsoever have been granted to Buyer, expressly or by implication or
estoppel, by the provisions of this Agreement with respect to any Intellectual
Property Rights. Any and all rights in and to any Intellectual Property Rights
not expressly granted to Buyer herein are reserved and retained by Seller.

 

Section 10.07 _. NO ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES._ EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 3.11 AND THIS ARTICLE, ANY INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE 10 ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITH
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY EXCLUDE
AND DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO
THE SHARED OWNED IPR LICENSE, ANY LIPR SUBLICENSE AND ANY INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Section 10.08 _. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY._ EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A CLAIM
RELATED TO OR ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH A BREACH OF SELLERS REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY IN SECTION 3.11, IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM THE EXERCISE OF THE
SHARED OWNED IPR LICENSE, ANY LIPR SUBLICENSE, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS ARTICLE 10 OR BUYERS, ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY
PERMITTED TRANSFEREES USE OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

 



71 Section 10.09. _UOP Licenses_. Seller and/or its Subsidiary is a party to
certain Process Licenses and related agreements (each a "UOP Agreement") with
UOP LLC or its Affiliates ("UOP") with respect to the operation of certain
process units at the Refinery (the "Refinery UOP Process Units"). Certain of
the UOP Agreements also relate to the operation of certain process units and
facilities associated with the Superior Business. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, Seller and/or its Subsidiary, Buyer and/or its
Affiliate and UOP have entered into a transfer agreement (the "UOP Transfer
Agreement") which provides, among other things, for Buyer and/or its Affiliate
and UOP to enter into new process license agreements with respect to
the Refinery UOP Process Units at or prior to the Closing. The parties agree
to comply with their obligations under the UOP Transfer Agreement.

CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION

 

Section 12.01 _. Notice._ In the event that, prior to the Closing Date, all or
any material portion of the Purchased Assets for which the associated repair
or replacement costs would reasonably be expected to exceed $2,000,000 is
damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty (a "Casualty") or is taken by
condemnation or eminent domain or by agreement in lieu thereof with any
Person or Governmental Authority authorized to exercise such rights (a
"Taking"), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer thereof and the remaining
portions of this Article 12 shall apply.

 

Section 12.02 _. Repair or Replacement._ (a) In the event of a Casualty or
Taking between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall elect,
at its option, to either (i) repair or replace or make adequate provision for
the repair or replacement of the affected Purchased Asset at Sellers cost
prior to the Closing, in which case Buyers obligation to effect the Closing
shall not be affected, but the Closing Date (and the Termination Date, if

replacement have been completed and the affected Purchased Asset has been
restored to performance substantially comparable in all material respects to

the Purchase Price to reflect the cost to repair or replace the
affected Purchased Assets and the post-Closing loss of net income associated
with such business interruption (such repair or replacement costs and loss of
net income, "Repair Costs"), in which case, in the event of a Repair Cost
Dispute, the Closing Date and the Termination Date shall be deferred as
provided in Section 12.05. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers election in
clause (i) of this Section 12.02(a) shall be unavailable and clause (ii) of
this Section 12.02(a) shall apply if the required repairs or replacements
would reasonably be expected to result in an extension of the Termination Date
for more than ninety (90) days.

 



73 (b) If Seller has elected to negotiate a reduced Purchase Price pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 12.02(a), and Seller and Buyer agree on the
Repair Costs within fifteen (15) days of Buyers receipt of Sellers notice of
the Casualty or Taking (the "Repair Negotiation Period"), Buyers obligation
to effect the Closing shall not be affected, but the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Repair Costs so agreed.

(c) If Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Repair Costs within the Repair
Negotiation Period (a "Repair Cost Dispute"), Buyer or Seller may request an
engineering company (and/or other appropriate specialist) that shall be
mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller to evaluate the affected Purchased
Assets and the loss of net income associated with such business interruption
and deliver to Buyer and Seller its written estimate of the Repair Costs (the
"Third-Party Estimate") within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Repair
Negotiation Period. If the Third-Party Estimate is less than $40,000,000 (or
greater than $40,000,000 and neither party terminates the Agreement as
permitted pursuant to Section 12.02(d), Buyers obligation to effect the
Closing shall not be affected and Buyer and Seller shall mutually resolve the
Repair Cost Dispute after the Closing in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.13 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the engineering company or
other appropriate specialist shall be deemed to be the Inspector for purposes
of Section 2.13), with a post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price equal
to the finally-determined Repair Costs.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Repair Costs as agreed to by
Buyer and Seller or the Third-Party Estimate, as applicable, is equal to or
greater than $40,000,000, Buyer or Seller may elect, by giving the other party
written notice of its election within three (3) Business Days of receipt of
the Third-Party Estimate, as applicable, to terminate this Agreement without

adjustment in favor of Seller shall be paid in cash to the extent the
Purchase Price had been reduced pursuant to this Article 12. Any such
reduction, refund or payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after
such final determination.

 

Section 12.05 _. Deferral of Closing Date and Termination Date._ In the event
of a Repair Cost Dispute, the Closing Date and the Termination Date shall, if
necessary, be deferred until (a) three (3) Business Days after receipt of the
Third-Party Estimate or (b) if Seller elects the option in Section
12.02(a)(i), as provided therein.

otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentence, if notice (which
notice must include reasonable detail regarding the specifics of the breach
or inaccuracy) of the breach or inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such right
of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity
may be sought prior to such time.

 

Section 13.02 _. Indemnification._ (a) Effective at and after the Closing and
subject to the other provisions of this Article 13, Seller hereby indemnifies
Buyer and its Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from
any and all damage, loss and expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding involving a third
party claim) ("Damages") actually suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to the extent arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty (each such misrepresentation
and breach of warranty a "Warranty Breach");

 

(ii) the breach of any covenants or agreements of Seller contained in this
Agreement (including Section 6.01, Section 7.03 and Section 7.07(a)); or

(iii) any Retained Liability;

 

 _provided_ that with respect to indemnification by Seller for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to Section 13.02(a)(i), (A) Seller shall not be liable for
any Warranty Breach where the amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty
Breach does not exceed $75,000 (the "De Minimis Amount") (and the amount of
such Damages shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (B)), (B) Seller
shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to
such

 



75  Warranty Breaches exceeds $6,500,000 (the "Deductible") and then Sellers
liability shall relate back to and include Damages only to the extent in
excess of $3,250,000 of aggregate Damages, and (C) Sellers maximum liability
for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $48,750,000 (the "Cap").

(b) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of
this Article 13, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against
and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually
suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates arising out of:

(i) any Warranty Breach by Buyer;

(ii) the breach of any covenants or agreements of Buyer contained in this
Agreement (including Section 5.02(a), Section 6.02, Section 7.03, Section
7.07(a) and Section 7.09); or

 

(iii) any Assumed Liability;

_provided_ that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches

Warranty Breach where the amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty
Breach does not exceed the De Minimis Amount (and the amount of such Damages
shall not be aggregated for purposes of clause (B)), (B) Buyer shall not be
liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty
Breaches exceeds the Deductible and then Buyers liability shall relate back
to and include Damages only to the extent in excess of $3,250,000 of aggregate
Damages, and (C) Buyers maximum liability for all such Warranty Breaches
shall not exceed the Cap.

Section 13.03 _. Third Party Claim Procedures._ (a) The party seeking
indemnification under this Article 13 (or any other provision of this
Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification) (the "Indemnified
Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against
whom indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third
party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third
Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in each case
at the Indemnifying Partys own expense.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.03,
(i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering
into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does

 



76  not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party and its
affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third
Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates, (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim
and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose and (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall not enter into any settlement of such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld). The fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.

(d) In connection with the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim,
each party shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such claim, (ii) furnish or cause
to be furnished such documents, records, information and testimony, grant or
cause to be granted access to all reasonably requested witnesses, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, in each
case as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, (iii) take all
reasonable steps to make available to the other party, upon written request,
its former and current employees, other personnel and agents (whether as
witnesses or otherwise) to the extent that such persons may reasonably be
required in connection therewith. Neither Seller nor Buyer will (and each of
Seller and Buyer shall cause its respective Affiliates not to) destroy or
dispose of any documents, records or information related to the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim without first using its reasonable best
efforts to notify the other party of the proposed destruction or disposition
and giving the other party the opportunity to take possession of or copy such
documents, records or information prior to such destruction or disposition. 

Section 13.04 _. Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under this Article 13 (or any other provision of
this Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification) against an
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 13.05 _. Calculation of Damages._ (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under this Article 13 (or any other provision of this Agreement that
expressly provides for indemnification) by the Indemnifying Party shall be
net of any (i) amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party under
applicable non-affiliated insurance policies (including the Environmental
Insurance Policy), or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor, net of any expenses related to the receipt of such insurance
proceeds, payments or recoupment, including retrospective premium adjustments,
and (ii) Tax benefit recognized and realized by the Indemnified Party
(based solely on the Indemnified Partys determination and calculation)
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. If the Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable non-affiliated insurance policies
(including the Environmental Insurance Policy), or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification
payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified

 



77  Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made
or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing
such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified
Party net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, payments or
recoupment.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Agreement for any
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that the Indemnified Party had
been compensated for such matter pursuant to the adjustments under Sections
2.08 or 2.09. The above notwithstanding, by waiving its right to a double
recovery under this Section, the Indemnified Party is not waiving any rights
it may have under Sections 2.08 or 2.09 to object, contest, or audit the
adjustments and allocations made under Sections 2.08 or 2.09.

(c) Each Indemnified Party must use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate
any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying
Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of
this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value
of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation within ten (10)
Business Days after the benefit is received.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to collect
any amounts available under unaffiliated insurance coverage (including under
the Environmental Insurance Policy), or from any other Person potentially
responsible, for any Damages payable under this Article 13 (or any
other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for
indemnification).

Section 13.06 _. Environmental Procedures. _ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article 13, with respect to any claim for indemnification
hereunder for any Assumed Environmental Liability, Retained Environmental
Liability or Warranty Breach of Section 3.16 (Environmental Compliance) or,
to the extent relating to Permits required by Environmental Law, Section 3.17
(Permits), or any other claim for indemnification hereunder relating in any
way to any Environmental Law or any Release, disposal or recycling of,
or exposure to, any Hazardous Material (collectively, "Environmental
Matters"), Buyer and Seller agree, in addition to any other relevant
provisions set forth in this Article 13 (and in the case of any conflict
between the provisions of this Section 13.06 and any other provision in
Article 13, the provisions of this Section 13.06 shall apply), as follows:

(a) The costs of any Remedial Action, which costs are otherwise subject to
indemnification hereunder, shall be indemnified only to the extent such costs
must be incurred to meet, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the
requirements of any applicable Environmental Law or to meet the legally
enforceable demands of any applicable Governmental Authority, using, where
possible, risk based standards, engineering or institutional controls or deed
or other restrictions so long as such standards, controls or restrictions do
not materially limit those industrial activities being performed on the
applicable property as of Closing; _provided_ that in the case of real
property (other than the Real Property or Refinery Easements) that is used
for non-industrial activities, such standards, controls or restrictions shall
not materially limit the activities being performed on such real property as
of Closing.

 



78 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have no liability under this Agreement
for any Damages to the extent (i) arising out of any sampling or other
invasive investigation of the air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater,
building materials or other environmental media or any disclosure, report or
communication to, or initiation or encouragement of any action by, any
Governmental Authority or other third party relating to any Environmental
Matters, unless such investigation, sampling, disclosure, report,
communication, initiation or encouragement is required by Environmental Law
or a Governmental Authority or is consistent with the Indemnified Partys bona
fide, ordinary course business practice and policy as of the date hereof for
conducting its refinery operations, which practice and policy do not provide
for post acquisition Phase II investigations or base line assessments, and is
not undertaken to create a liability for the Indemnifying Party or (ii)
arising in connection with any construction, renovation, modification,
expansion, reconstruction, shutdown, demolition, financing or closure of any
asset, facility or real property at or after Closing.

(c) As between Buyer and Seller, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
at its option to control such Environmental Matter, including the disclosure,
investigation, negotiation, performance, remediation, monitoring, settlement
and resolution of such matter; _provided_ that if Seller is the controlling
party, it must use reasonable efforts not to unreasonably disrupt or interfere
with Buyers operation of the Business. The Indemnifying Party may not settle
a matter that would impose obligations under Environmental Law on the
Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Partys prior written approval, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld. With respect to any Environmental
Matter, (i) the controlling party shall keep the other party reasonably
informed; (ii) Buyer and Seller agree to, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate with the other party in providing reasonable access to properties
and facilities and reasonably promptly provide each other with copies of all
communications relating to such matter received from or delivered to any
Person; (iii) with respect to the performance of any Remedial Actions
conducted at the Real Property, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, comply, in all material respects, with all reasonable safety and security
requirements that are required by Buyer and provided in advance to Seller in
writing.

 

(d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Environmental Insurance Policy
contains its own procedures, including with respect to notice, cooperation
and defense of claims, and that to the extent any of the provisions of this
Article 13 conflict with the provisions of the Environmental Insurance Policy
with respect to any claim that is submitted pursuant to such policy, the
terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy shall prevail,
_provided_ , _however_ , the terms of the Environmental Insurance Policy shall
in no way limit any right to indemnification provided under this Agreement. 

(e) No Indemnifying Party shall have liability under this Agreement for any
Damages to the extent such Damages are exacerbated by acts or omissions of or
on behalf of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

Section 13.07 _. Assignment of Claims._ If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 13.02 and the Indemnified Party potentially could have recovered all
or a part of such Damages from a non-affiliated third party (a "Potential
Contributor"), the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to
proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment.

AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR FRAUD (WHICH SHALL NOT INCLUDE FRAUD BASED ON

ARTICLE 14

 

TERMINATION

Section 14.01 _. Grounds for Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) (i) by either Seller or Buyer upon notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the nine month
anniversary of the Execution Date (the "Termination Date"), (ii) by Seller
upon notice to Buyer, if any of the conditions in Section 11.01 or Section
11.03 shall have become incapable of fulfillment on or prior to the
Termination Date, or (iii) by Buyer upon notice to Seller, if any of the
conditions in Section 11.01 or Section 11.02 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment on or prior to the Termination Date;  _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.01(b) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results
in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such date.

(c) by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 12.02(d);

 

(d) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not include a temporary restraining
order) of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction.

 



81 The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.01(b)(ii) or 14.01(b)(iii), Section 14.01(c) or Section 14.01(d) shall
give notice of such termination to the applicable other party. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 14.01 to the contrary, the termination of this
Agreement by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 14.01(b)(ii) or
14.01(b)(iii) as it relates to the condition in Section 11.01(a) having not
been satisfied on or before the Termination Date, or the condition in Section
11.01(b) having not been satisfied as a result of an order, injunction or
decree relating to antitrust law shall not occur prior to the Termination
Date, unless both Parties agree that such condition is not capable of being
satisfied on or prior to the Termination Date.

 

Section 14.02 _. Effect of Termination._

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 14.01, such
termination shall be without liability of any party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
party) or the Buyer Parent to any other party to this Agreement; _provided_
that if such termination shall result from the willful and knowing (i)
failure of a party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the material
obligations of any other party prior to termination, (ii) failure to perform a
material covenant of this Agreement or (iii) material breach by a
party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein,
such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered
by the other parties as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of
this Section 14.02 and Sections 15.02, 15.03, 15.04, 15.05, 15.06, 15.07 and
15.09 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 14.01.

relates to either (x) the condition in Section 11.01(a) having not been
satisfied on or before the Termination Date, or (y) the condition in Section
11.01(b) having not been satisfied as a result of an order, injunction or
decree relating to antitrust law, or (ii) Section 14.01(d) to the extent the
termination right in Section 14.01(d) is triggered as a result of an order,
decree or judgment relating to antitrust law, then Buyer shall, (x) in the
case of a termination by Seller, pay to Seller an amount equal to $10,000,000
in immediately available funds (the "Break-up Fee") within five Business Days
of Buyers receipt of Sellers notice of termination, or (y) in the case of a
termination by Buyer, pay to Seller the Break-up Fee concurrently with (and as
a condition to the effectiveness of) Buyers delivery of notice of
termination to Seller.

hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and

action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be

Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were

Section 15.12 _. Disclosure Schedules._ (a) Seller and Buyer have set forth
information on the Seller Disclosure Schedule and Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
as applicable, in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. Except with respect to matters set forth in
Sections 1.01(a) Part VI, 1.01(a) Part VII, 3.16 or 3.17 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and Sections 1.01(a) Part I or 1.01(a) Part II of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule, a matter set forth in one section of the applicable
Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other section of the
applicable Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to such other section
of the applicable Disclosure Schedule or to a section of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
Buyer Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely for
informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
and (ii) the disclosure by a party of any matter in the applicable Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by such party

Section 11.02(a) has been satisfied at Closing.

 

Section 15.13 _. Construction and Interpretation._ The parties hereto agree
that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be
resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction

irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any court set forth in Section 15.06, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ that no party shall be
entitled to an injunction or specific performance requiring the other party
to consummate the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the proviso to the
preceding sentence shall not, in any respect, limit any other remedy to which
a party is entitled at law or in equity.

 



86 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
