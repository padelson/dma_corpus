ARTICLE III 

MERGER CONSIDERATION AND CLOSING

3.1 Purchase Price.

(a) Payment. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, in consideration for the Merger, SolarWinds will
make the payments specified in Section 3.2 and Section 3.5(b) below.

3.2 Adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(a) Initial Adjustment to Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. Not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Confio shall deliver to
SolarWinds Confio's estimated unaudited balance sheet as of the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and an estimate of the Closing Working
Capital Amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Working Capital Amount"), together with all appropriate supporting
documentation. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Confio
in good faith, in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the
Year End Financial Statements.

(b) Closing Balance Sheet. SolarWinds will deliver a proposed Closing Balance
Sheet, prepared in a manner consistent with Section 3.2(a) above (the
"Proposed Closing Balance Sheet"), which Proposed Closing Balance Sheet will
include SolarWinds' determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date, to the Equity Holder
Representative within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date. If,
within fifteen (15) calendar days following delivery of the Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet, the Equity Holder Representative has not given SolarWinds
notice of its objection to the Closing Working Capital Amount (which notice
must contain a statement in reasonable detail of the basis of any such
objection), then such Closing Working Capital Amount shall be considered
final. If the Equity Holder Representative gives notice of an objection,
SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative shall use their respective
good faith efforts to resolve any dispute by negotiation. If such dispute
cannot be settled by negotiation within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by SolarWinds of the Equity Holder Representative's notice, the
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the financial issue resolution
process set forth in Section 3.2(c) below. The Closing Working Capital Amount
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2 shall be referred to
herein as the "Final Working Capital Amount"; the Proposed Closing Balance
Sheet as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.2 shall
constitute the "Closing Balance Sheet."

(c) Financial Issue Resolution Process. Disputes between SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representative regarding the Final Working Capital Amount that
cannot be resolved by negotiation within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by SolarWinds of the Equity Holder Representative's notice in
accordance with Section 3.2(b) above shall be referred by SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representative, no later than such 30th calendar day, for
decision to a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm
mutually acceptable to the Equity Holder Representative and SolarWinds (the
"Auditor"), which shall act as arbitrator and determine a resolution of the
dispute, based solely on presentations by the Equity Holder Representative and
SolarWinds and only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted.
The Auditor shall deliver its written determination to SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representative no later than the 30th calendar day after the
remaining differences underlying the dispute are referred to the Auditor, or
such longer period of time as the Auditor determines is necessary. The
Auditor's determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties and not
subject to appeal. The Auditor will determine the allocation of its fees,
costs and expenses in determining the Final Working Capital Amount based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. SolarWinds and the
Equity Holder Representative shall make readily available to the Auditor all
relevant information, books, records and any work papers relating to the
dispute and all other items reasonably requested by the Auditor (excluding
documents subject to the attorney-client privilege). In no event may the
Auditor's resolution of any difference be for an amount that is outside the
range of SolarWinds' and the Equity Holder Representative's disagreement.

(d) Finalization and Payment of the Final Purchase Price. The Purchase Price
will be adjusted, upward or downwards, by comparing the Final Working Capital
Amount to the Estimated Working Capital Amount. If the Final Working Capital
Amount is greater than the Estimated Working Capital Amount (the amount by
which the Final Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Working Capital
Amount being referred to herein as the "Excess Working Capital Amount"),
SolarWinds shall, within three (3) Business Days after the Final Working
Capital Amount is finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.2, pay to the
Paying Agent for distribution to the Confio Equity Holders, in immediately
available funds, the Excess Working Capital Amount with such amount to be paid to the Confio Equity Holders, in accordance with
each Confio Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share, provided, however, that if the
actual Final Working Capital Amount is in excess of $3,000,000.00, then the
Final Working Capital Amount shall conclusively be deemed to be $3,000,000.00
for purposes of calculating any Excess Working Capital Amount under this
Section 3.2(d) so that the Purchase Price is not adjusted upward for the Final
Working Capital Amount in excess of $3,000,000.00. If the Final Working
Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Working Capital Amount (the amount
by which the Estimated Working Capital Amount exceeds the Final Working
Capital Amount being referred to herein as the "Working Capital Shortfall
Amount"), the Equity Holder Representative shall, within three (3) Business
Days after the Final Working Capital Amount is finally determined pursuant to
this Section 3.2, pay or cause to be paid to SolarWinds the Working Capital
Shortfall Amount in immediately available funds out of the Escrow Fund
established pursuant to Section 7.4, in accordance with each Confio Equity
Holder's Pro Rata Share. In the event that the Equity Holder Representative
for any reason fails to make any payment contemplated above, then SolarWinds
may bring an indemnification claim under Article VII. The obligations of the
Confio Equity Holders under this Section 3.2 are not subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.3(a) - (c).

3.3 Time and Place of Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the Contemplated Transactions shall have been abandoned

conditions set forth in Section 3.4, the Merger and Contemplated Transactions
shall be consummated (the "Closing") at the offices of Squire Sanders (US)
LLP, 8000 Towers Crescent Drive, 14th Floor, Vienna, Virginia at 10:00 a.m.

within three (3) Business Days) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions

place, as shall be agreed upon in writing by SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representative (the "Closing Date").

3.8 [Intentionally omitted].

3.9 Payment for Options and Payment for, and Surrender of, Shares.

(a) Payment and Surrender of Options and Shares. The Paying Agent shall act as
paying agent in effecting the exchange of cash for Shares and the Options
entitled to payment pursuant to Section 3.6. As soon as practicable (and in
any event within one (1) Business Day) (i) after the Effective Time, Confio
shall provide to each Option Holder who is an employee of Confio as of the
date hereof a properly completed letter of transmittal in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) after
the Effective Time, SolarWinds shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
Stockholder and holder of Non-Employee Options a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, in each case together with instructions for use of the Letter of
Transmittal in effecting the surrender in the case of a Stockholder,
certificates or instruments that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding Confio Common Stock or Series A Shares or
Series B Shares, as applicable, that were converted into the right to receive
consideration pursuant to Section 3.6 (the "Certificates") in exchange for the
applicable portion of the Closing Cash Consideration.

The Letter of Transmittal shall include a release of Confio, SolarWinds and
the Merger Sub as well as customary representations and warranties by each
Confio Equity Holder, and shall specify that delivery of the Certificates
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon receipt thereof by SolarWinds (or, in the case of any lost
Certificate, compliance with Section 3.10), together with a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each
Person effecting the surrender of such Certificates. Each (x) Stockholder,
upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together
with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions and (y) Option
Holder upon completion of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such
other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check (or via wire
transfer if so elected) representing the then-applicable portion of the
Closing Cash Consideration to which such Stockholder or Option Holder is
entitled under Section 3.6, determined pursuant to this Agreement and as set
forth on the Spreadsheet, and any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior
to the Effective Time, represented shares of Confio Common Stock or Series A
Shares or Series B Shares, as applicable, will be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the right to
receive upon surrender the then-applicable portion of the Closing Cash
Consideration, together with the rights to receive (i) such Confio Equity
Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Cash in accordance with Section 7.4, and
(ii) any rights granted to the Confio Equity Holders pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and as set forth on the Spreadsheet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Confio Equity
Holder holding greater than five percent (5%) of the Common Equivalents, so
long as such Confio Equity Holder delivers a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
and delivers its Certificates no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, the Equity Holder Representative will cause the Paying Agent to
use commercially reasonable efforts to wire the payment payable to any such
Confio Equity Holder pursuant to Section 3.5(b) in immediately available funds
on the Closing Date.

(b) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of Confio shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration of
transfers of any Shares thereafter on the records of Confio. If, after the
Effective Time and through the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time,
Certificates representing any such Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for any payment due as
provided in this Article III. No Confio Equity Holder shall be entitled to
receive interest on any amount payable upon the surrender of Certificates.

(c) Late Surrender. If any Confio Equity Holder fails to surrender and
exchange Certificate(s) by the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time,
thereafter such holders shall only be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation as general, unsecured creditors thereof (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) to receive amounts payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates and shall not be entitled to receive any
interest thereon.

(d) Escheat, Etc. None of SolarWinds, the Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate(s) shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Purchase Price or any dividends or distributions payable to
the holder of such Certificate(s) would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity), any such Purchase Price or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

3.10 Lost Certificates. In the event a Stockholder claims a certificate
representing a Share has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will
forward additional documentation and instructions necessary to be completed in
order to effectively surrender the Shares represented by such lost or
destroyed Certificate(s) (including instructions relating to payment by holder
of such lost or destroyed Certificate of an indemnity/surety bond fee equal to
2.25% of the cash value of the Shares represented by such Certificate and a
$150.00 handling fee).

3.11 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
share of Confio Common Stock or Series A Share or Series B Share that,
immediately before the Effective Time, was held by any Person who has duly
exercised in connection with the Merger the appraisal rights afforded to
Dissenting Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL (such shares, collectively,
"Dissenting Shares") will be converted into the right to receive the fair
value of such shares determined in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL and shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Purchase Price in accordance with this
Article III.

(b) Confio shall generally keep SolarWinds reasonably informed of the status
of any demands for appraisal received by Confio, which shall specifically
include that Confio shall give SolarWinds prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by Confio, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments related thereto served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
Confio; provided, however, that Confio shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct any such negotiations or proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

(c) If there are any Dissenting Stockholders, SolarWinds shall withhold from
the Closing Cash Consideration the Dissenting Stockholders' Amount. The
Surviving Corporation shall be solely responsible for payment of all amounts
in the event that appraisal and payment rights with respect to any Dissenting
Shares are duly exercised pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or for paying
the Purchase Price to such Stockholders in the event that appraisal rights
were not duly exercised or were withdrawn.

3.12 Equity Holder Representative.

(a) Charles Sander is hereby appointed as the Equity Holders' true and lawful
representative, proxy, agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Equity Holder
Representative") for a term that shall be continuing and indefinite and

amounts payable to the Indemnified Parties, in each case on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, in the name of the Equity Holder Representative and
(viii) to take all actions and execute such documents as are or may be
necessary or appropriate in the sole opinion of the Equity Holder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be
changed at any time and from time to time by the action of Confio Equity
Holders holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding
Shares that approved the Merger, and shall become effective upon not less than
thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice to SolarWinds. Except as
provided in the foregoing sentence, in the event that for any reason the most
recent Equity Holder Representative shall no longer be serving in such
capacity, including, without limitation, as a result of the death, resignation, or incapacity of the Equity Holder Representative, either (A) the
outgoing Equity Holder Representative shall appoint a successor Equity Holder
Representative or (B) if the outgoing Equity Holder Representative is unable,
unwilling or otherwise fails to appoint a successor Equity Holder
Representative, then Confio Equity Holders holding more than fifty percent
(50%) of the issued and outstanding Shares that approved the Merger shall
designate another Person to act as Equity Holder Representative, such that, at
all times, to the extent practicable, there will be an Equity Holder
Representative with the authority provided hereunder. Any change in the Equity
Holder Representative pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall become
effective upon delivery of written notice of such change to SolarWinds. The
Equity Holder Representative shall not receive compensation for his services.
The authority conferred under this Section 3.12 is an agency coupled with an
interest and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, all authority
conferred hereby is irrevocable and not subject to termination by the
undersigned or by operation of Law, whether by the death or incapacity of any
of the Confio Equity Holders, or the occurrence of any other event.

(b) The Equity Holder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder in his capacity as Equity Holder Representative in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on his part. The Confio
Equity Holders shall severally and not jointly indemnify the Equity Holder
Representative and hold the Equity Holder Representative harmless from and
against any and all damages, actions, proceedings, demands, Liabilities,
losses, taxes, fines, penalties, costs, claims and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel) of any kind or nature
whatsoever (whether or not arising out of third-party claims and including all
amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing) which
may be sustained or suffered by the Equity Holder Representative in connection
with the administration of his duties hereunder, except where such losses
arise from or are the result of the Equity Holder Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(c) Any decision, act, consent or instruction taken or given by the Equity
Holder Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall be and constitute a
decision, act, consent or instruction of all Confio Equity Holders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Confio Equity Holder.
SolarWinds and the Merger Sub, and, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation, may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Equity Holder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every Confio Equity Holder and shall have
no duty to inquire as to the acts and omissions of the Equity Holder
Representative. The Merger Sub, SolarWinds and, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation, are hereby relieved from any Liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with, or otherwise with respect
to any aspect of, such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equity
Holder Representative.

(d) Notices given to the Equity Holder Representative in accordance with
Section 9.1 shall constitute notice to the Confio Equity Holders for all
purposes under this Agreement.

(e) All expenses, if any, reasonably incurred by the Equity Holder
Representative in connection with the performance of his duties as the Equity
Holder Representative will be borne and paid by the Confio Equity Holders
according to their respective Pro Rata Shares. The Equity Holder Representative shall establish, on or prior to the Closing Date,
a segregated account with a third party financial institution over which the
Equity Holder Representative shall have control (the "Equity Holder
Representative Account"), into which the Expense Escrow Cash shall be
deposited by SolarWinds at the Effective Time in accordance with Section
3.5(b)(ii). The Equity Holder Representative may use the Expense Escrow Cash
in his sole discretion, at any time and from time to time between the date of
this Agreement and the conclusion of the Escrow Period, in connection with the
performance of his duties as the Equity Holder Representative. Within ten (10)
Business Days following the conclusion of the Escrow Period, any and all of
the remaining Expense Escrow Cash shall be released by the Equity Holder
Representative from the Equity Holder Representative Account to the Paying
Agent to be distributed to the Confio Equity Holders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares.



ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CONFIO



Confio represents and warrants to SolarWinds and the Merger Sub, and
acknowledges that SolarWinds and the Merger Sub are relying upon such
representations and warranties in connection with the Merger and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, that the statements contained
in this Article IV are true and correct as of the date hereof, except as set
forth in the Confio Disclosure Schedule delivered to SolarWinds and the Merger
Sub concurrently with the delivery of this Agreement and attached hereto as
Exhibit I (the "Confio Disclosure Schedule"), which disclosure shall provide
an exception to, or otherwise qualify, the representations or warranties of
Confio contained in the section of this Agreement corresponding by number to
such disclosure and to any other representation or warranty in this Agreement
to which the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its
face or if the items are expressly cross-referenced.

4.1 Corporate Organization; Standing and Power. Confio is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Confio has no subsidiaries. Confio has the corporate power to own
its properties and to carry on its Business as it is now being conducted and
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a
Confio Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.1 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule
lists each of the jurisdictions in which Confio is qualified to do business.
Confio has previously furnished to SolarWinds a complete and correct copy of
Confio's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date (the
"Confio Charter Documents"). Confio is not in violation of any of the
provisions of the Confio Charter Documents. Confio does not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in,
nor control directly or indirectly, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company or other business association, whether
incorporated or unincorporated. 4.2 Capitalization. Section 4.2 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule sets forth
all of the holders of Confio Capital Stock, who are the sole registered and
beneficial holders of all of the issued and outstanding securities of any kind
of Confio (voting or otherwise), including all options, warrants and shares of
restricted stock, and the class and number of securities held by each holder.
Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, there
are no other equity securities of any kind, no options, rights, warrants,
preemptive rights, calls, subscriptions, commitments, stockholder agreements
or other instruments, understandings or contracts (whether oral or written)
outstanding giving any Person the right to acquire from Confio or any Equity
Holder of Confio (whether by exercise, conversion or otherwise) any securities
of any kind of Confio (voting or otherwise) nor are there any commitments to
issue or execute any of the foregoing. None of the outstanding Shares has been
issued in violation of any preemptive rights of any security holder of Confio
or in violation of applicable securities Laws or any other Law of any
jurisdiction applicable to such issuance.

4.3 Authority.

(a) Confio has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the agreements (including the Paying Agent Agreement) and
documents relating hereto (the "Transaction Documents") to which it is a party
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Confio is a party
and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Confio, other than
the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
Shares voting for the adoption of the Merger Agreement (the "Confio
Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which Confio is a party have been duly executed and delivered by Confio and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto) constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Confio
enforceable against Confio in accordance with their respective terms subject
to (i) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and the relief of debtors or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and (ii) the availability of specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents (to
which Confio is a party) by Confio does not, and the performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents (to which Confio is a party) by Confio
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Confio Charter Documents, (ii)
conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to Confio, or by which any of its
assets or properties are bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
could become a default) under, or impair Confio's rights or alter the rights
or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of an Encumbrance, other than a Permitted Encumbrance, on any of the
properties or assets of Confio pursuant to any Contract to which Confio is a
party or by which Confio's properties are bound or affected, except in the
case of clause (iii), as would not be material. (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(c) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
and except for applicable filings and notifications required under the HSR Act
or applicable foreign antitrust or competition laws to be made by the parties
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and the expiration or
termination of applicable waiting periods or the receipt of applicable
consents under the HSR Act or foreign antitrust or competition laws, no
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity or third party is required by or with
respect to Confio in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, other than any such consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings the absence of which
would (i) not prevent or materially delay the consummation by Confio of the
Contemplated Transactions or (ii) result in a Confio Material Adverse Effect.

4.4 Compliance with Laws. Confio's properties and operations are in compliance
in all material respects with all Laws applicable to Confio or by which any of
its properties or operations is bound or affected. Confio has not received
any, and is not aware of any, notice or other communication (whether written
or, to the knowledge of Confio, oral) from any Governmental Entity regarding
any actual, alleged, possible or potential violation of, or any failure to
comply with, any Law applicable to the Business.

4.5 Financial Statements.

(a) In General. Section 4.5(a) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule contains

Disclosure Schedule, the Confio Financial Statements (including the notes
thereto) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of
Confio as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows of Confio for the periods covered thereby and have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except that the unaudited Confio Financial Statements do
not contain all notes required by GAAP and are subject to normal year‑end
audit adjustments the effect of which will not, individually or in the
aggregate, be materially adverse to Confio), applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby (except to the extent disclosed therein
or required by changes in GAAP).

(b) No Undisclosed Liabilities. Confio has no liabilities that would be
required to be accrued on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP

Statements in the ordinary course of business, (iii) performance obligations
under the executory portion of any Contract by which Confio is bound, (iv)

Disclosure Schedule, all Accounts Receivable reflected in the Confio Financial
Statements as of the date of the Confio Financial Statements or recorded on
the books of Confio resulted from the ordinary course of business and have
been properly recorded. Subject to the reserves consistent with prior periods
and throughout the periods involved, all billed and, to the knowledge of
Confio, all unbilled receivables are good and collectible in full without any
discount, setoff or valid counterclaim (net of recovery from vendors or
subcontractors), in amounts equal to not less than the amounts thereof
reflected in the Confio Financial Statements.

(d) No Letters of Credit, Bonds or Guarantees. Except as reflected in the
Confio Financial Statements or as set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule, Confio (i) has no bonds or letters of credit outstanding
as to which Confio has any actual or contingent reimbursement obligations;
(ii) is not a party to or bound, either absolutely or on a contingent basis,
by any agreement of guarantee, indemnification, reimbursement or any similar
commitment, in each case with respect to the Liabilities or obligations of any
other Person (whether accrued, absolute, or contingent); or (iii) is not a
party to any swap, hedge, derivative, or similar instrument.

(e) Contingent or Deferred Acquisition Expenses or Payments. Except as
otherwise set forth in Section 4.5(e) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
Confio is not obligated or otherwise liable for the payment of any contingent
or deferred acquisition payments relating to the direct or indirect
acquisition of any business, enterprise, or combination.

4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since July 31, 2013, Confio has
conducted the Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and there has not been: (a) any Confio Material Adverse Effect; (b) any
transaction, commitment, contract or agreement entered into by Confio, or any

materially adversely affecting Confio or the Business; (c) any material damage
to, or any destruction or loss of, any property of Confio (whether or not
covered by insurance); or (d) any revaluation by Confio of any of its property
for accounting purposes.

4.7 Litigation. Except as set forth on Section 4.7 of the Confio Disclosure
Schedule, there is no private or governmental action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation ("Action") pending before any Governmental Entity
or, to the knowledge of Confio, threatened (including allegations that could
form the basis for future Action), against Confio or, to the knowledge of
Confio, against any of its properties, officers, directors or stockholders (in
their capacities as such) or otherwise involving the Business. There is no
judgment, decree or order against Confio that would have a Confio Material
Adverse Effect. Confio is not a party (nor, to the knowledge of Confio,
threatened to become a party) to any Action. Confio does not have any plans to
initiate any Action against any third party.

4.8 Governmental Authorization. The Permits include each federal, territorial,
county or local governmental consent, license, permit, grant, or other
authorization of a Governmental Entity (a) pursuant to which Confio currently
operates or holds any interest in any of its properties related to the
Business or (b) that is required for the operation of the Business or the
holding of any such interest in the manner conducted or held as of the date
hereof, and all of such Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to obtain or have any such Permits would have a Confio Material Adverse Effect and, to the actual knowledge of Confio such
Permits will be available for use by Confio in the Business immediately
following the Closing.

4.9 Title to Property; Assets.

(a) Confio has good and valid title to, or in the case of leased properties or
assets, a valid leasehold interest in, all of its assets, in each case free
and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances and those
listed on Section 4.9(a) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule. Section 4.9(a) of
the Confio Disclosure Schedule lists all tangible property owned or leased by
Confio.

(b) Confio has complied in all material respects with the terms of all leases
to which it is a party, and all such leases are in full force and effect and,
to Confio's knowledge, no other party to any such lease is in material breach
thereof or has materially failed to perform thereunder. True and complete
copies of all leases have been made available to SolarWinds.

(c) Confio's assets (other than Intellectual Property Rights) include all of
the material assets that are necessary to operate the Business in the same
manner immediately after the Closing as it was operated by Confio on the date
of this Agreement and that have been used by Confio in the operation of the
Business. Its tangible assets are, to the knowledge of Confio, free from
defects (patent and latent), and the assets have been maintained in accordance
with normal industry practice for companies similarly situated to Confio, are
in good operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear), and
are suitable for the purposes for which they are currently being used by
Confio.

(d) To the knowledge of Confio, there are no developments affecting any such
property or assets pending or, to the knowledge of Confio, threatened, which,
individually or in the aggregate, might reasonably be expected to materially
detract from the value of such property or assets, or materially interfere
with the use of any such property or assets.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary to this Section 4.9, Confio makes
no representations or warranties in this Section 4.9 regarding any
Intellectual Property Rights.

(ii) all unregistered Trademarks owned by Confio or used in the Business;
(iii) all unregistered Copyrights to computer software and Trade Secrets in
computer software and any other unregistered Confio Intellectual Property;
(iv) Domain Names registered to or used by Confio; and (v) any proceedings or
actions before any court, tribunal (including the PTO or equivalent authority
anywhere in the world) related to any of the Confio Registered Intellectual
Property Rights or Confio Intellectual Property.

(b) Each registration of Confio Registered Intellectual Property Rights is
valid and subsisting. All necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees
in connection with the Confio Registered Intellectual Property Rights have been paid and all
necessary documents and certificates in connection with such Confio Registered
Intellectual Property Rights have been filed with the relevant patent,
copyright, trademark or other authorities in the United States or other
foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining
such Registered Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth in Section
4.10(b) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions that must be
taken by Confio within ninety (90) calendar days of the Closing Date,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the
filing of any responses to actions, documents, applications or certificates
for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting, preserving or renewing
any Registered Intellectual Property Right. In each case in which Confio has
acquired any Technology or Intellectual Property Right from any Person (other
than Intellectual Property Rights licensed from third parties pursuant to
valid license agreements listed in Section 4.10(p) of the Confio Disclosure
Schedule), Confio has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient
to irrevocably transfer all rights in such Technology and any Intellectual
Property Rights (including the right to seek past and future damages with
respect thereto) to Confio. To the maximum extent provided for, by, and in
accordance with, applicable Laws and regulations, Confio has recorded each
assignment related to Confio Registered Intellectual Property Rights with the
relevant Governmental Entity, including the PTO, the U.S. Copyright Office or
their respective equivalents in any relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be.
None of the Intellectual Property Rights used by Confio, other than
Intellectual Property Rights licensed from third parties pursuant to valid
license agreements listed in Section 4.10(p) of the Confio Disclosure
Schedule, are registered in the name of any Person other tha Confio.

(c) Each item of Confio Intellectual Property and, to Confio's knowledge, all
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology licensed to Confio (other than
commercially available third party software development tools so long as no
part of such tools is included in the Business' products or services), are
free and clear of any Encumbrances. Confio is the exclusive owner of all
Confio Intellectual Property.

(d) Except as set forth on Section 4.10(d) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
Confio has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that (i) Confio believes
may render any Confio Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable,
including any information or fact that may constitute prior art, (ii) would
render any of the Confio Registered Intellectual Property Rights invalid or
unenforceable, or (iii) would adversely affect any pending application for any
Confio Registered Intellectual Property Right. Confio has not misrepresented,
or failed to disclose, nor does Confio have any knowledge of any
misrepresentation or failure to disclose, any fact or circumstances in any
application for any Confio Registered Intellectual Property Right that would
constitute fraud or a misrepresentation with respect to such application or
that would otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of any Intellectual
Property Right of Confio.

(e) Section 4.10(e) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses,
options or other rights granted by any third party to Confio with respect to
any Intellectual Property Rights (excluding off-the-shelf), used in the
Business, in each case identifying the third party and the Intellectual
Property Rights. Other than general know-how and information available in the
public domain without charge and without any restrictions or limitations, the
Confio Intellectual Property listed on Section 4.10(a) of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule and the Intellectual Property Rights licensed to Confio listed on Section 4.10(e) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule
constitute all the Technology and Intellectual Property Rights used in or
necessary to the conduct of the Business, including the design, development,
manufacture, use, import and sale of products, technology and performance of
services (including products, technology or services under development at such
time).

(f) Confio has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect its rights in
its confidential information in any Technology and in the Confio Intellectual
Property Rights. Without limiting the foregoing, Confio has, and enforces, a
policy requiring each employee or independent contractor to execute a
proprietary information, confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement,
the form of which has been provided to SolarWinds, and all current and former
employees and independent contractors of Confio have executed such an
agreement that covers the periods of time in which such individuals were
engaged by Confio.

(g) To the extent that any Confio Intellectual Property has been developed or
created by any Person other than Confio or jointly with any Person other than
Confio, Confio has a written agreement with such Person with respect thereto,
and thereby has irrevocably obtained worldwide, perpetual ownership of, and is
the exclusive owner of, all such Technology and associated Intellectual
Property Rights, including the right to seek past and future damages with
respect thereto by operation of law or by valid assignment; and has received
the waiver with respect thereto of all non-assignable rights including but not
limited to all author or moral rights. Each current and former employee or
independent contractor has entered into a valid and binding written agreement
with Confio sufficient to vest title in Confio of all Technology and
Intellectual Property Rights created by such employee or independent
contractor.

(h) All Confio Intellectual Property used in the conduct of the Business has
been developed or created solely by either (i) employees of Confio acting
within the scope of their employment or (ii) third parties, including
independent contractors acting within the scope of their engagement, who have
validly and irrevocably assigned, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
all of their rights, including Intellectual Property Rights therein, to
Confio, and no third party owns or has any rights or claims to any of the
Confio Intellectual Property. For the avoidance of doubt, "third parties" as
used in subpart (ii) above includes sellers from whom Confio has purchased
Confio Intellectual Property.

(i) The contracts, licenses and agreements listed in Section 4.10(i) of the
Confio Disclosure Schedule include all contracts, licenses and agreements
(whether written or oral) pursuant to which any person has licensed any
Technology or Intellectual Property Rights to Confio in connection with the
Business. Confio is not in breach of, nor has it failed to perform under, any
of the foregoing contracts, licenses or agreements and, to Confio's knowledge,
no other party to any such contract, license or agreement is in breach thereof
or has failed to perform thereunder.

(j) To Confio's knowledge, the operation of the Business, including the
design, development, use, import, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing,
manufacture, sale and licensing of the products, technology or services of
Confio did not, does not, and will not when conducted by SolarWinds in
substantially the same manner following the Closing, infringe or
misappropriate any Intellectual Property Right of any Person, violate any
right of any Person (including any right to privacy or publicity), or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction, and Confio
has not received notice from any Person claiming that such operation of the
Business or any act, product, technology or service (including products,
technology or services currently under development) of Confio infringes or
misappropriates any Intellectual Property Right of any Person or constitutes
unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction (nor
does Confio have knowledge of any basis therefor).

(k) To Confio's knowledge, there are no contracts, licenses or agreements
(whether written or oral) between Confio and any other Person with respect to
Confio's Intellectual Property under which there is any dispute regarding the
scope of such agreement, or performance under such agreement including with
respect to any payments to be made or received by Confio thereunder.

(l) To Confio's knowledge, no Person is infringing or misappropriating, or has
infringed or misappropriated, any Confio Intellectual Property. Confio has not
brought any action, suit or proceeding for infringement of any Confio
Intellectual Property or breach of any license or agreement involving
Intellectual Property Rights against any third party.

(m) Except as described on Section 4.10(d) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
no Confio Intellectual Property is subject to any proceeding or outstanding
decree, order, judgment or settlement agreement or stipulation that restricts
in any manner the use, transfer or licensing thereof by Confio or that may
affect the validity, use or enforceability of the foregoing.

(n) All Confio Intellectual Property is fully transferable, alienable or
licensable by the Surviving Corporation from and after Closing and without
restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party, except for
applicable fees in connection with recording of assignments with applicable
Governmental Entities to the extent necessary or desirable.

(o) Confio has not transferred ownership of, or granted exclusive rights to
use, any Technology or Intellectual Property Right that is or was Confio
Intellectual Property, to any other Person.

(p) The contracts, licenses and agreements listed in Section 4.10(p)(i) of the
Confio Disclosure Schedule include all contracts, licenses and agreements
(whether written or oral) to which Confio is a party with respect to any
Technology or Intellectual Property Rights, including, without limitation, any
licenses granted to third parties with respect to any of the Confio
Intellectual Property except for End-User Licenses. A true and correct copy of
such End-User License is provided in Section 4.10(p)(ii) of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule. Any Intellectual Property Rights used by Confio in the
conduct of the Business that are not Confio Intellectual Property are listed
in Section 4.10(e) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in
Section 4.10(p)(iii) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, the termination or
expiration of any inbound licenses of Technology or Intellectual Property
Rights (other than commercially available third party software development
tools so long as no part of such tools is included in Confio's products or
services) will not materially and adversely affect the operation of the
Business. Except as set forth in Section 4.10(p)(iv) of the Confio Disclosure
Schedule, no Person who has licensed Technology or Intellectual Property
Rights to Confio has ownership rights or license rights to improvements made by
Confio in such Technology or Intellectual Property Rights which have been
licensed to Confio.

(q) Section 4.10(q) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule lists all contracts,
licenses and agreements (whether written or oral) between Confio and any other
Person wherein or whereby, with respect to the Business, Confio has agreed to,
or assumed, any obligation or duty to indemnify, reimburse, hold harmless,
guaranty or otherwise assume or incur any obligation or Liability or provide a
right of rescission with respect to the infringement or misappropriation by
Confio or such other person of the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person
other than Confio.

(r) Neither this Agreement, any Transaction Document nor the Contemplated
Transactions, by operation of law or otherwise, or any contracts or agreements
(whether written or oral) to which Confio is a party, will result in (i) any
third party being granted rights or access to, or the placement in or release
from escrow, of any Confio Intellectual Property, (ii) SolarWinds granting to
any third party any right, title or interest to or with respect to any
Technology and Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed to,
SolarWinds pursuant to any agreement to which Confio is a party or by which it
is bound, (iii) SolarWinds being bound by, or subject to, any agreement not to
compete or other restriction on the operation or scope of its business or the
Business, (iv) any restriction on the ability of SolarWinds to share
information relating to its ongoing business or operations, or (v) SolarWinds
being obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts to any third party in
excess of those payable by Confio prior to the Closing Date pursuant to
agreements to which Confio is a party or by which it is bound.

(s) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(s) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
Confio does not and has not used any Public Software in connection with the
development of its products or services or incorporated any Public Software
into its products or services. The list in Section 4.10(s) of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule shall contain (i) the name of the Public Software, (ii)
the license name and version pursuant to which Confio has received a license
to use such Public Software, and (iii) a short statement regarding how the
Public Software is being used by Confio. Except as set forth in Section
4.10(s) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, (a) Confio is in compliance in all
material respects with all Public Software license agreements to which Confio
is a party, and (b) Confio's use or incorporation of Public Software has not
and does not (i) grant to any third party any rights in Confio's products,
services or intellectual property, (ii) require the licensing, disclosure, or
distribution of any source code developed by or for Confio, (iii) require
Confio to license the use of its products or services to third parties without
charge, or (iv) create restrictions on or immunities to Confio's enforcement
of its Intellectual Property Rights. "Public Software" means any software that
contains, includes, incorporates, or has instantiated therein, or is derived
in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software that is distributed
pursuant to a license that (1) requires the licensee to distribute or provide
access to the source code of such software or any portion thereof when the
object code is distributed, (2) requires the licensee to distribute the
software or any portion thereof for free or at some reduced price, or (3)
requires that other software or any portion thereof combined with, linked to,
or based upon such software ("Combined Software") be licensed pursuant to the
same license or requires the distribution of all or any portion of such
Combined Software for free or at some reduced price or otherwise adversely
affects Confio's exclusive ownership of its code contained in such Combined
Software and ability to license such Combined Software. The term "Public Software" includes, without limitation,
software licensed or distributed under any of the following licenses or
distribution models, or licenses or distribution models similar to any of the
following: (i) GNU's General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL
(LGPL); (ii) the Artistic License (e.g., PERL); (iii) the Mozilla Public
License; (iv) the Netscape Public License; (iv) the Sun Community Source

(t) All data which has been collected, stored, maintained or otherwise used by
Confio and its subsidiaries, or by a Professional Employer Organization
("PEO") or payroll service provider used by Confio, acting with respect to
Confio-related data, has been collected, stored, maintained, used and
disclosed in accordance with all applicable Laws, guidelines, contracts, and
industry standards for companies similarly situated to Confio. Neither Confio
nor any of its subsidiaries has received a notice of non-compliance with
applicable data protection Laws, guidelines or industry standards. Confio and
its subsidiaries have made all registrations that Confio and its subsidiaries
are required to have made in relation to the processing of data, and are in
good standing with respect to such registrations, with all fees due within
ninety (90) calendar days of the date hereof and the Closing Date duly made.
Confio and its subsidiaries' practices are, and have always been, in
compliance in all material respects with (i) their then-current privacy policy
or statement, including the privacy policy or statement posted on Confio's and
its subsidiaries' websites, and (ii) their customers' privacy policies, when
required to do so by contract. Confio, its subsidiaries and any PEO or payroll
service provider used by Confio have implemented and maintained appropriate
and reasonable measures to protect and maintain the confidential nature of any
personal information relating to the Business. Confio, its subsidiaries and
any PEO or payroll service provider used by Confio have adequate technological
and procedural measures in place in accordance with industry standards for
companies similarly situated to Confio to protect personal information
collected by Confio or a subsidiary of Confio against loss, theft and
unauthorized access or disclosure. Confio and its subsidiaries have the full
power and authority to transfer any and all rights in any individual's
personal information in Confio's and its subsidiaries' possession or control
to SolarWinds. Neither Confio nor any subsidiary of Confio is subject to any
obligation (whether written or oral) that would prevent SolarWinds from using
the personal information in a manner consistent with any Law, guideline,
contract or industry standard regarding the collection, retention, use, or
disclosure of such information.

(u) Each registered Trademark of Confio is used in its jurisdiction of
registration, in association with all wares and services for which it is
registered and in the form appearing in the applicable registration, and has
been used with sufficient continuity in association with those wares and in
such form, and any use by licensee of the Trademark has been controlled and
enforced by Confio, so as to avoid any abandonment, cancellation, expungement
or other such challenge against the Trademark associated with non-continuous
use, or otherwise (including the unenforceability of the Trademark, in each
applicable jurisdiction).

(v) Confio and each of its subsidiaries employ commercially reasonable
measures in accordance with industry standards for companies similarly
situated to Confio to ensure that no software contained within Confio's
products or services or otherwise used by Confio contains any viruses. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "virus" means any computer code intentionally designed to disrupt, disable, or harm in any manner the operation of any
software or hardware or to allow a third party to have access to the user's
computer or network without such user's authority.

(w) Confio owns and has good title or, with respect to Public Software, has
sufficient license rights to the source code relating to all products
manufactured, sold, licensed, leased, or delivered by Confio and each service
rendered by Confio (collectively, the "Source Code"). Except for any Public
Software, the Source Code (i) has at all times been maintained in confidence,
(ii) has been disclosed by Confio only to employees and consultants who need
to have access to such Source Code and are bound by valid and binding written
non-disclosure obligations, (iii) has not been sold, transferred, or licensed
to any customer or third party; (iv) except as listed on Section 4.10(w) of
the Confio Disclosure Schedule, is not the subject of any escrow or similar
agreement or arrangement (whether written or oral) giving any third party
rights in such Source Code upon the occurrence of certain events; and (v) to
the extent such Source Code is the subject of any escrow or similar agreement
or arrangement as listed on Section 4.10(w) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule,
no events have occurred that would give rise to the release of such Source
Code to such third party and Confio has no reason to believe that such an
event giving rise to such a release is likely to occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, taking into account the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

(d) ERISA. (i) No "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the
Code, has been incurred with respect to any Corporation Plan subject to such
Section 412, whether or not waived. No "reportable event," within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA, and no event described in Section 4062 or 4063 of
ERISA, has occurred in connection with any Corporation Plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA. Neither (A) Confio nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or
is expected to incur prior to the Closing Date, nor (B) any PEO or payroll
service provider acting in its relationship with Confio has incurred, or, to
Confio's knowledge, is expected to incur prior to the Closing Date, a
Liability (direct or indirect) under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection
with the termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan
covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA. The assets of Confio are
not now, nor will they after the passage of time be, subject to any lien
imposed under Code Section 412(n) by reason of a failure of Confio or any
ERISA Affiliate to make timely installments or other payments required under
Code Section 412 prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) With respect to all the Corporation Plans, Confio and every ERISA
Affiliate and any PEO or payroll service provider acting in its relationship
with Confio are in compliance in all material respects with all requirements
prescribed by all statutes, regulations, orders or rules currently in effect
and have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be
performed by them. All returns, reports and disclosure statements required to
be made under ERISA and the Code with respect to all Corporation Plans have
been timely filed or delivered. Neither Confio nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any
PEO or payroll service provider used by Confio, nor, to Confio's knowledge,
any of their directors, officers, employees or agents, nor any trustee or
administrator of any trust created under the Corporation Plans, has engaged in
or been a party to any non-exempt "prohibited transaction" as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA which could subject Confio
or its Affiliates, directors or employees or the Corporation Plans or the
trusts relating thereto or any party dealing with any of the Corporation Plans
or trusts to any tax or penalty on "prohibited transactions" imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code. No fiduciary (as defined in ERISA Section 3(21)) has
any Liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or
comply in connection with either the administration or the assets of any
Corporation Plan.

(e) Plan Determinations. Each Corporation Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to so qualify or has
a remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such a determination, and the trusts
created thereunder have been determined to be exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code or a period of time remains to apply for such a
determination; copies of all determination letters or, for any Corporation
Plan maintained under a prototype document, opinion letters, have been made
available to SolarWinds, and, to the knowledge of Confio, nothing has occurred
since the date of such determination letters or opinion letters, as
applicable, which is likely to cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption, or result in the imposition of any excise Tax or income Tax on
unrelated business income under the Code or ERISA with respect to any
Corporation Plan.

(f) Funding. (i) All contributions, premiums or other payments by Confio or, to the extent
Confio could have any Liability therefor, any PEO or payroll service provider
used by Confio due or required to be made under any Corporation Plan prior to
the date hereof have been made as of the date hereof, as applicable, in
accordance with applicable Law or, if required by GAAP, are properly reflected
on Confio's financial statements.

(ii) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Confio, threatened audits,
investigations, examinations, actions, liens, suits, or proceedings relating
to any Corporation Plan other than routine claims by Persons entitled to
benefits thereunder, nor is any Corporation Plan the subject of any pending
(or, to the knowledge of Confio, any threatened) investigation or audit by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person.

(iii) No event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of Confio, there exists no
condition or set of circumstances, which presents a material risk of a partial
termination (within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) of any
Corporation Plan.

(iv) With respect to any Corporation Plan that is qualified under Section
401(k) of the Code, individually and in the aggregate, to the knowledge of
Confio, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, in connection with which Confio could be subject to any
Liability (except Liability for benefits claims and funding obligations
payable in the ordinary course) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable
law. All employee contributions, including elective deferrals, to any
Corporation Plan have been segregated from Confio's general assets and
deposited into the trust established pursuant to such plan in a timely manner
in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor and other
applicable law.

(v) Neither Confio nor any ERISA Affiliate nor, to the extent Confio could
have any Liability therefor, any PEO or payroll service provider used by
Confio has Liability (contingent or otherwise) under Section 4069 of ERISA by
reason of a transfer of an underfunded "defined benefit plan" (as defined in
ERISA Section 3(35).

(g) Certain Other Matters. Except as reserved for on the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet, and to its knowledge, neither Confio nor any PEO or payroll
service provider used by Confio has any Liability or potential Liability in
any form whatsoever, and neither Confio nor any PEO or payroll service
provider used by Confio will have any Liability or potential Liability in any
form whatsoever, with regard to any Corporation Plan, as a result of (i) any
failure to perform non-discrimination testing on any Corporation Plan; (ii)
any failure to amend any Corporation Plan pursuant to the requirements of
applicable Law; (iii) the classification or misclassification of employee and
independent contractors; or (iv) the failure to comply with applicable Law.

(h) Welfare Plans. With respect to any Corporation Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) (a "Welfare
Plan"), (i) each Welfare Plan for which contributions are claimed by Confio or
any PEO or payroll service provider acting in its relationship with Confio as
deductions under any provision of the Code is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable requirements pertaining to such deduction, (ii)
with respect to any welfare benefit fund (within the meaning of Section 419 of
the Code) related to a Welfare Plan, there is no disqualified benefit (within the meaning of Section 4976(b)
of the Code) that would result in the imposition of a Tax under Section
4976(a) of the Code or (iii) any Corporation Plan that is a group health plan
(within the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code) complies, and in each
and every case has complied, in all material respects with all of the
applicable material requirements of COBRA, the Family Medical Leave Act of
1993, the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the
Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1996, the Newborns' and Mothers'
Health Protection Act of 1996, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
of 2010 and regulations thereunder, or any similar provisions of state Law
applicable to employees of Confio or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them. None
of the Corporation Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree
welfare benefits to any Person except as required by COBRA, and none of Confio
and any PEO or payroll service provider acting in its relationship with Confio
or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them has represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree benefits to any
employee, former employee, director, consultant or other Person, except to the
extent required by COBRA or a similarly applicable state statute and except
for the continuation of health or welfare benefits to former employees or
service providers through the end of the month in which they terminate
service, or pursuant to post-termination severance arrangements. No
Corporation Plan or employment agreement provides health benefits that are not
insured through an insurance contract other than a Code Section 125
Corporation Plan. Each Corporation Plan is amendable and terminable
unilaterally by Confio or applicable PEO or payroll service provider used by
Confio at any time without material Liability to Confio as a result thereof,
and no Corporation Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary plan
description or other written communication distributed generally to employees
by its terms prohibits Confio or applicable PEO or payroll service provider
used by Confio from amending or terminating any such Corporation Plan.

(i) Effect of Transaction. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
specifically set forth in Section 4.12(i) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule
hereto, no employee or former employee of Confio or any ERISA Affiliate to the
extent Confio could have any Liability therefor, will become entitled to any
material bonus, severance or similar benefit (including acceleration of
vesting or exercise of an incentive award) as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions, and there is no contract, plan or arrangement covering any
"disqualified individual" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(c) that,
individually or collectively, could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
payment that would not be deductible to SolarWinds or Confio by reason of
Sections 280G of the Code.

(j) No Employer or Closely-Held Stock. During all relevant time periods, no
Corporation Plan has owned stock or any other equity security of (i) Confio or
any ERISA Affiliate or (ii) any non-publicly traded corporation or company. 4.13 Agreements, Contracts and Commitments. Section 4.13 of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the following Contracts (or, in the
case of oral Contracts, summaries thereof) to which Confio is a party
(collectively, the "Material Contracts"):

(a) any Contract that involves a payment in excess of $50,000 per annum
following the Closing Date or the performance of which will extend over a
period of more than twelve (12) months;

(b) any Contracts to which Confio is a party or by which Confio or any of its
properties or assets is bound that cannot be terminated without penalty with
sixty (60) days or less notice by Confio;

(c) any Contract with sales or other agents, brokers, franchisees,
distributors or dealers other than in the ordinary course of business;

(d) any Contract granting exclusive distribution or supply rights;

(e) any partnership or joint venture agreement;

(f) any lease, lease guaranty, sublease or other Contract for the leasing, use
or other occupancy of property material to the operation of the Business;

(g) any Contracts that contain options to purchase or rights of first refusal
to acquire any of Confio's material assets;

(h) any Contracts for the borrowing or lending of money or guaranty agreement;

(i) any Contracts that contain any provisions requiring Confio to indemnify
any other party thereto other than End-User Licenses;

(j) any Contracts granting any Person a Lien, other than a Permitted
Encumbrance, on any of Confio's material assets;

(k) any Contract restricting Confio's right to conduct the Business as
presently conducted and proposed to be conducted at any time, in any manner or
at any place in the world, or the expansion thereof to other geographical
areas, customers, suppliers or lines of business;

(l) any Contract granting most favored pricing to customers;

(m) any Contract between Confio and any current or former employee, consultant
or director of Confio pursuant to which benefits would vest or amounts would
become payable or the terms of which would otherwise be altered as a result of
the Contemplated Transactions or by any other Transaction Document to which
Confio is a party (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events); or

(n) any other Contract, or group of related Contracts, the termination or
breach of which would have a Confio Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of all written Material Contracts and true and
complete summaries of all oral Material Contracts (and all amendments, waivers
or other modifications thereto) have been made available to SolarWinds. Each
Material Contract is valid, subsisting, in full force and effect and binding
upon Confio and, to the knowledge of Confio, the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms. Confio is not in default (and no condition exists
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by
Confio) under any Material Contract, which default would give the other party
the right to terminate or modify such Material Contract or would accelerate
any obligation or payment by Confio, nor, to the knowledge of Confio, is any
other party to any Material Contract in default thereunder (nor to the
knowledge of Confio does any condition exist that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default by any such party). Except as set
forth on Section 4.13 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, none of the Material
Contracts is currently being renegotiated, and except as set forth on Section
4.13 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, the validity, effectiveness and
continuation of each of the Material Contracts will not be materially
adversely affected by the Contemplated Transactions. To the knowledge of
Confio, no party to any of the Material Contracts has made, asserted or has
any defense, setoff or counterclaim under its Material Contract or has
exercised any option granted to it to cancel, terminate or shorten the term of
its Material Contract. Except as set forth on Section 4.13 of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Material Contracts require consents to be
obtained by Confio as a result of the Contemplated Transactions.

4.14 Transactions with Affiliates. Other than as set forth in Section 4.14 of
the Confio Disclosure Schedule, there are no loans, leases, royalty agreements
or other continuing transactions between Confio and any of Confio's present
or, to Confio's knowledge, former directors, officers, employees (other than
ordinary course proprietary information, invention assignment, non-competition
or non-solicitation agreements that restrict the ability of such employee to
compete with or solicit from Confio or Contracts with respect to the grant of
Options or the sale of shares of Capital Stock, which Options or shares of
Capital Stock are accurately reflected on Section 4.2 of the Confio Disclosure
Schedule), consultants or stockholders or, to Confio's knowledge, any member
of any director, officer, employee, consultant or stockholder's immediate
family. To Confio's knowledge, none of Confio's present directors, officers,
employees, consultants or stockholders has any direct or indirect interest in
any entity that does business with Confio (other than an interest in less than
three percent (3%) of the capital stock of any publicly-traded company), has
any direct or indirect interest in any entity which competes with the
Business, has any direct or indirect interest in any property, asset or right
used by Confio in the conduct of the Business or, other than as set forth in
Section 4.14 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, has any contractual
relationship (whether written or oral) with Confio other than such
relationships that result solely from being a director, officer, employee,
consultant, agent, representative or stockholder of Confio.

4.15 Environmental Matters. Confio is in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits and all
past non-compliance, if any, of Confio with Environmental Laws or
Environmental Permits has been resolved without any pending, ongoing or future
obligation, cost or Liability, except where such failure to comply or failure
to resolve will not materially affect Confio, the Business, SolarWinds or the
Surviving Corporation. 4.16 Customers and Suppliers. A true and correct list of all Confio customers
and suppliers has been made provided to SolarWinds. True and correct copies of
each contract, agreement, contract right, license agreement, purchase and sale
order, quotation or other executory right (whether written or oral) between
Confio and any of its customers or suppliers and related to the Business, has
been made available to SolarWinds. Section 4.16 of the Confio Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and correct list of (a) Confio's fifty (50) largest
customers based on revenue received during the seven (7) months ending July
31, 2013 and (b) Confio's ten (10) largest suppliers based on expenditures
made during the seven (7) months ending July 31, 2013 (collectively, the
"Customers and Suppliers"). Since July 31, 2013, Confio has not received (i)
written notice that there has been a loss of, or material subscription
cancellation by, any such Customer or Supplier, (ii) written notice of
termination by any customer who represents more than $100,000 in revenue since
January 1, 2012, or (iii) written notice of termination from any of its
customers which, in the aggregate, represent more than five percent (5%) of
Confio's revenue received during the seven (7) months ending July 31, 2013.

4.17 Warranties; Defects; Liabilities. Each product developed, sold, licensed,
leased, or delivered by Confio, and each service rendered by Confio, in the
course of the Business has been in conformity with all applicable contractual
commitments (whether written or oral) and all express and implied warranties
except where the failure to be in such conformity would not have a Confio
Material Adverse Effect. Confio has no Liability (and to the knowledge of
Confio, there is no current reasonable basis for any Action against it giving
rise to any Liability) for replacement or repair of any such products or with
respect to any such services, or for other damages in connection therewith.
Except as set forth in Section 4.17 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule, no
product manufactured, sold, licensed or delivered by Confio, or service
rendered by Confio, in the course of the Business is subject to any guarantee,
warranty, or other indemnity beyond the applicable standard terms and
conditions of Confio relating to such sale, license, delivery or service.

4.18 Employee Matters.

(a) Section 4.18 of the Confio Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all employees who are employed by, and of all independent
contractors rendering service to, the Business as of the date hereof, and such
list correctly reflects their names, employer(s), dates of employment,
positions, salaries, wage rates and any other compensation plans (other than
benefits under the Corporation Plans) and status (active or non-active and, if
non-active, reason and length of time not active).

(b) Neither Confio nor, to Confio's knowledge, any PEO or payroll service
provider used by Confio has made any statements to current employees or
contractors of Confio indicating or implying that SolarWinds has an obligation
to such employee or contractor or otherwise to retain the services of such
employees or contractors of the Business permanently or for any fixed period
of time after Closing, other than if SolarWinds intends to offer such employee
or contractor an employment agreement or contractor agreement after the
Closing.

(c) There are no Actions pending, or, to the knowledge of Confio, threatened
or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor and employment, safety or
discrimination matters involving any employee or independent contractor of
Confio that could affect the Business or adversely affect the Surviving Corporation's operation of the Business
substantially in the manner being conducted. Confio is not presently, nor has
it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining
agreement or union contract with respect to employees or contractors, and no
collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by or on behalf of Confio.
To the knowledge of Confio, there are no current attempts to organize or
establish any labor union or employee association with respect to any
employees or contractors of the Business.

4.19 Complete Copies of Material Contracts. All Material Contracts provided by

bankruptcy proceeding filed against it, (iii) file a petition or answer of
consent seeking reorganization under any bankruptcy or any similar Law or

Contemplated Transactions.

4.22 No Restrictions. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.22 of the

of Confio is bound or affected by, any judgment, injunction, order, decree,
contract, covenant or agreement (non-compete or otherwise, and whether written
or oral) (each, a "Restriction") that restricts or prohibits, or purports to
restrict or prohibit, Confio from freely engaging in the Business or from
competing anywhere in the world (including any contracts, covenants or
agreements (whether written or oral) restricting the geographic area in which
Confio may sell, license, market, distribute or support any products or
technology or provide services; or restricting the markets, customers or
industries that Confio may address in operating the Business; or restricting

affect the conduct of the Business.

in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

5.4 Litigation. There is no Action pending before any Governmental Entity or,
to the knowledge of SolarWinds, threatened (including allegations that could
form the basis for future Action), against SolarWinds or the Merger Sub or any
of their properties, officers, directors or stockholders (in their capacities
as such), or any judgment, decree or order against SolarWinds or the Merger
Sub, in each case that could reasonably be expected to have a SolarWinds
Material Adverse Effect.

5.5 Sufficiency of Funds. SolarWinds has sufficient immediately available
funds to pay the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement and satisfy the
Surviving Corporation's Liabilities post-Closing. ARTICLE VI

6.3 Employment; Corporation Plans.

(a)Prior to the Closing Date, SolarWinds or its Affiliates may make offers of
employment to each Confio employee that SolarWinds has designated as a Confio
Key Employee (as listed on Schedule 1.1(p)); SolarWinds shall provide to each
such Confio Key Employee the necessary paperwork for such employment including
the Key Employee Non-competition Agreement and Employee Proprietary
Information Agreement (collectively, the "Standard Employee Documents").
SolarWinds may also, in its sole discretion, identify other Confio employees
as Continuing Employees to receive offers of employment by SolarWinds or its
Affiliates. Such employment offers to Confio Key Employees and Continuing
Employees shall be effective as of the Effective Time. Such employment offers
to Confio Key Employees and Continuing Employees shall be on such terms and
conditions as SolarWinds shall determine in its discretion.



(b)Nothing contained in this Article VI shall create any rights in any Confio
Key Employee or Continuing Employee to continued employment for any period
after the Closing Date.



(c)From and after the Closing Date, any Confio Key Employee or Continuing
Employee who signs the Standard Employee Documents, and chooses to remain an
employee of Confio or become an employee of SolarWinds, as the case may be,
shall be given (to the extent he or she elects to participate and it is
permitted by Law), credit for past service with Confio for purposes of
participation under any Corporation Plan (including any SolarWinds 401(k) plan
or Welfare Plan and (other than for defined benefit pension plans) benefit
accrual purposes under any Welfare Plan offered by SolarWinds to such
employee, including, without limitation, any vacation/paid time off policy).



(d)Any severance amounts to be paid in connection with the termination of any
employee of Confio who is not a Confio Key Employee or a Continuing Employee
shall be paid by SolarWinds prior to Closing; provided, however, that any
severance payments pursuant to change in control or employment agreements
already in place between such employee(s) and Confio shall be paid by Confio. (e)Prior to the Closing, and effective immediately prior to the Closing in
accordance with applicable Laws, Confio shall take all necessary action to
terminate, or withdraw from, as applicable, any Corporation Plan covering any
Confio employee.



6.4 Access to Books and Records Following the Closing. Following the Closing,
SolarWinds shall permit the Equity Holder Representative and its authorized
representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
have reasonable access to, and examine and make copies of, all books and
records of Confio and/or SolarWinds that relate to transactions or events
occurring prior to the Closing or transactions or events occurring subsequent
to the Closing that are related to or arise out of transactions or events
occurring prior to the Closing; provided, however, (a) that the Equity Holder
Representative and his representatives shall take such action as is deemed
necessary in the reasonable judgment of SolarWinds and Confio to schedule such
access and visits through a designated officer of Confio and in such a way as
to avoid disrupting the normal business of SolarWinds and/or Confio, (b)
neither SolarWinds nor Confio shall be required to take any action that would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege and (c) neither
SolarWinds nor Confio need supply the Equity Holder Representative, or his
representatives, with any information which, in the reasonable judgment of
SolarWinds or Confio (as the case may be), is under a contractual or legal
obligation not to supply, including, without limitation, as a result of any
governmental or defense industrial security clearance requirement or program
requirements of any Governmental Entity prohibiting certain Persons from
sharing information.

6.5 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. SolarWinds shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely
basis and on a basis reasonably consistent with Confio's past practice (unless
SolarWinds is advised in writing otherwise by its independent outside
accountants or attorneys that such practice is contrary to applicable Law),
all Tax Returns with respect to Confio for taxable periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date and required to be filed thereafter (the "Prior Period
Returns"). The reasonable costs of preparing and filing all such Prior Period
Returns shall be the responsibility of the Equity Holders and SolarWinds shall
be entitled to be reimbursed such costs from the Escrow Fund established
pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof. SolarWinds shall provide a draft copy of such
Prior Period Returns to the Equity Holder Representative for its review at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date thereof. The Equity Holder
Representative shall provide his comments to SolarWinds at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date of such Prior Period Returns and
SolarWinds shall make all changes reasonably requested by the Equity Holder
Representative in good faith (unless SolarWinds is advised in writing by its
independent outside accountants or attorneys that such changes (i) are
contrary to applicable Law, or (ii) will have a material adverse effect on
SolarWinds or any of its Affiliates in any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date). Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which
SolarWinds pays any Taxes of Confio with respect to any Prior Period Returns,
the Confio Equity Holders shall, to the extent such Taxes have not been
accrued or otherwise reserved for on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
taken into account as a current liability for purposes of calculating the Closing Working Capital Amount, pay to SolarWinds the
amount of such Taxes that relates to the Prior Period Returns. In the event
that the Confio Equity Holders for any reason fail to make the payment
contemplated in the previous sentence, then SolarWinds may bring an
indemnification claim under Article VII.

(b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date.

(i) SolarWinds shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to
be filed, on a basis reasonably consistent with Confio's past practice, any
Tax Returns of Confio for Tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and
end after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Straddle Periods" and each, a
"Straddle Period"). SolarWinds shall provide a draft copy of such Straddle
Period Tax Returns to the Equity Holder Representative for review at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the due date thereof. The Equity Holder
Representative shall provide comments to SolarWinds at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns and SolarWinds shall make all
changes reasonably requested by the Equity Holder Representative in good faith
(unless SolarWinds is advised in writing by its independent outside
accountants and attorneys that such changes (i) are contrary to applicable
Law, or (ii) will, or are likely to, have a material adverse effect on
SolarWinds or any of its Affiliates in any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date). Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which
SolarWinds pays any Taxes of Confio with respect to any Straddle Period, the
Confio Equity Holders shall, to the extent such Taxes have not been accrued or
otherwise reserved for on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and taken into
account as a current liability for purposes of calculating the Closing Working
Capital Amount, pay to SolarWinds the amount of such Taxes that relates to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Tax Period"). In the event that the Confio Equity Holders for any reason fail
to make the payment contemplated in the previous sentence, then SolarWinds may
bring an indemnification claim under Article VII.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement:

(1) In the case of any gross receipts, sales and use, income, or similar Taxes
that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes
allocable to (x) the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (y) the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day next succeeding the Closing Date (the
"Post-Closing Tax Period") shall be determined on the basis of a deemed
closing at the end of the Closing Date of the books and records of Confio.

(2) In the case of any Taxes (other than gross receipts, sales and use,
income, or similar Taxes) that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
prior to the Closing Date shall be equal to the product of all such Taxes
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period from the commencement of the Straddle Period through and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period; provided, however, that appropriate adjustments
shall be made to reflect specific events that can be identified and
specifically allocated as occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (in which
case the Confio Equity Holders shall be responsible for any Taxes related
thereto) or occurring after the Closing Date (in which case, SolarWinds shall
be responsible for any Taxes related thereto). (iii) SolarWinds shall be responsible for any Taxes with respect to the Post-
Closing Tax Period of the Straddle Periods.

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(i) SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by any Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation, or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding (including any determination by SolarWinds of any limitation on the
net operating losses or other Tax attributes of Confio under Code Sections
382, 383 or 384) and making their respective employees, outside consultants
and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. SolarWinds and
the Equity Holder Representative, on behalf of the Equity Holders, agree (A)
to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
Confio relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
SolarWinds or the Equity Holder Representative, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Entity, and (B) to give the other
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other so requests, SolarWinds or the Equity
Holder Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other to take
possession of such books and records.

(ii) SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative further agree, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions).

(iii) The Equity Holder Representative further agrees, upon request, to
provide SolarWinds with all information that SolarWinds may reasonably request
to satisfy the requirements of FASB Interpretation 48.

(d) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including any transfer or
similar Tax imposed by any Governmental Entity) shall be shared equally
between SolarWinds on the one hand and the Confio Equity Holders on the other,
and each shall be responsible for one-half of such Taxes. The Party required
by Law to do so will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the
other Parties will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

(e) Indemnification and Tax Contests. SolarWinds' and the Confio Equity
Holders' payment and indemnification obligations with respect to the covenants
in this Section 6.5, together with the procedures to be observed in connection with any Tax
contest, shall be governed by Article VII.

6.6 Spreadsheet. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Confio shall deliver to SolarWinds a spreadsheet (the "Estimated
Spreadsheet") substantially in the form of Schedule 6.6, which Estimated
Spreadsheet shall include, as of the Closing (on a pro forma basis) (a) a list
of all Confio Equity Holders and their respective addresses (to the extent
known), (b) the number of shares of Confio Capital Stock or Options held by
such Confio Equity Holders, (c) the portion of the Common Share Amount due to
each Confio Equity Holder, (d) the amount of the Escrow Cash to be deposited
with the Escrow Agent on behalf of each Confio Equity Holder and (e) the Pro
Rata Share of each Confio Equity Holder. At or prior to the Closing, Confio
shall revise the Estimated Spreadsheet to reflect any changes or correct any
inaccuracies set forth in the Estimated Spreadsheet provided by SolarWinds to
Confio prior to the Closing Date (such final spreadsheet delivered to
SolarWinds pursuant to Section 3.5(a)(iv), the "Spreadsheet").

6.7 Directors' and Officers' Liability.

(a) SolarWinds agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing existing as of the date of this Agreement under
(i) any Confio Charter Document or (ii) any written agreement pursuant to
which Confio is a party providing for indemnification in favor of the current
and former directors and/or officers of Confio shall survive the Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
following the Closing, and SolarWinds shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Section 6.7(a) is intended to benefit each Person who was a
director and/or an officer of Confio prior to the Closing, and shall be
binding on all successors of SolarWinds and Confio. SolarWinds hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the
indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) and the
Confio Charter Documents. In the event that SolarWinds, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns
and transferees of SolarWinds or Confio or their respective successors or
assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7(a).

(b) Prior to the Closing, Confio shall obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as Confio's current insurance carrier with respect to the directors' and
officers' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
Confio's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing Date.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each current director
and officer of Confio and his or her heirs and personal representatives, and
nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any
such current director or officer and his or her heirs and personal
representatives may have under the Confio Charter Documents or any Contract or applicable Law. The
obligations of SolarWinds under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.7 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 6.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7).

6.8 Required Approvals.

(a) Confio and SolarWinds shall use their reasonable efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as
practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required (A)
to be obtained or made by SolarWinds, Confio or any of their respective
subsidiaries or stockholders, and (B) to avoid any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in connection with
the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and regulations and
rules issued pursuant to that act (collectively, the "HSR Act") (and antitrust
and competition laws of any other applicable jurisdiction), in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger, and (iii) make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions required under (A) the HSR Act and antitrust
and competition laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and (B) any other
applicable Laws. Confio and SolarWinds shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all filings or submissions referenced in the
preceding sentence and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any Governmental Entity with respect to any such filing or
submission. Confio and SolarWinds shall, to the extent practicable, consult
the other on, all the information relating to Confio, SolarWinds and its
subsidiaries, and the stockholders of each, as the case may be, that appears
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger. Confio and
SolarWinds may, as each deems reasonably advisable and necessary, designate
any competitively sensitive information requested by the other under this
Section 6.8(a) as "outside counsel only," and such information shall be given
only to such requesting party's outside legal counsel based on an undertaking
from such counsel reasonably satisfactory to the other party to the effect
that such information shall be kept confidential and not provided to the
requesting party. In addition, Confio, SolarWinds and the stockholders of each
may redact any information from such documents shared with the other party or
its counsel that is not pertinent to the Merger and the subject matter of the
filing or submission. Each of Confio and SolarWinds shall promptly notify and
provide a copy to the other party of any written communication received from
any Governmental Entity with respect to any filing or submission or with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions. Each of Confio and SolarWinds shall
give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any
proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filing or any such transaction. Neither Confio nor
SolarWinds shall, nor shall they permit their respective officers, employees,
consultants, attorneys, accountants or other representatives (collectively,
the "Representatives") to, independently participate in any meeting, or engage
in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to attend or participate. The Parties to this
Agreement will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement
in connection with proceedings under, or related to, the HSR Act or applicable
competition laws.

(b) Confio and SolarWinds shall give any notices to third parties, and use,
and cause their respective subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to
obtain any non-governmental third party consents necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. In the event that
either party shall fail to obtain any such third party consent, such party
shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon
Confio and SolarWinds, their respective subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after
the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent; provided,
however, that this Section 6.8(b) shall not constitute in any way a waiver of
the closing condition in Section 3.4(c)(i) related to the delivery of third
party consents.

6.9 No Solicitation of a Competing Proposal.

(a) Subject to Section 6.9(b), from and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Confio agrees that it will not, and
that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal (as defined
below) or (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with, or disclose or provide any material nonpublic information concerning
Confio to, any Person with respect to a Competing Proposal. Subject to Section
6.9(b), Confio shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities that would otherwise be a violation of this Section 6.9(a)
heretofore conducted by Confio or its Representatives with respect to any
Competing Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.9(a), if, after the
date of this Agreement, Confio receives a Competing Proposal that was either
unsolicited or solicited prior to the date of this Agreement and that the
Confio Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
Confio's outside legal and financial advisors (i) is or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and (ii) that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Confio Stockholders under applicable law,
Confio may: (A) disclose or provide nonpublic information to the Person making
such Competing Proposal, (subject to the prior execution by such Person of a
confidentiality agreement on customary terms) and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to the Competing Proposal;
provided, however, that as promptly as reasonably practicable following Confio
taking such actions as described in clauses (A) and (B) above, Confio shall
provide written notice to SolarWinds of such determination of the Confio Board
of Directors as provided above. (c) The Confio Board of Directors has adopted a resolution declaring that this
Agreement is advisable and recommending that the Confio Stockholders adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation").
Subject to Section 6.9(d), the Confio Board of Directors shall not (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to SolarWinds, the Company Board Recommendation,
(ii) recommend a Superior Proposal to the Confio Stockholders, or (iii) cause
Confio to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, or
definitive agreement (A) relating to any Superior Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement on customary terms entered into in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.9(b)) or (B) requiring Confio to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger.

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Sections 6.9(a) and 6.9(c),
prior to obtaining the Confio Stockholder Approval, the Confio Board of
Directors may (i) withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
SolarWinds, the Company Board Recommendation (a "Change of Board
Recommendation"), (ii) recommend a Superior Proposal to the Confio
Stockholders, or (iii) cause Confio to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or definitive agreement relating to a Superior
Proposal, if, in any case, the Confio Board of Directors determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Stockholders under applicable law; provided that concurrently with entering
into any such letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement, Confio shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g)
and pay the amount it is obligated to pay in accordance with Section 8.3(b).

(e) As used in this Agreement, "Competing Proposal" shall mean any written
bona fide proposal (other than a proposal or offer by SolarWinds or any of its
subsidiaries) for (i) a merger or business combination with or involving
Confio; (ii) the acquisition by any Person of a material portion of the assets
or Business; or (iii) the acquisition by any Person of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the issued and outstanding Confio Capital Stock.

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing
Proposal for or in respect of all or substantially all of the outstanding
Confio Shares or all or substantially all of the assets or Business made by
any Person on terms that the Confio Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with Confio's financial and legal advisors, and
considering such factors as the Confio Board of Directors considers to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to Confio and its
Stockholders than the Contemplated Transactions.

6.10 Further Assurances. The Parties shall execute such further documents, and
perform such further acts, as may be necessary to transfer and convey the
Business to SolarWinds, on the terms herein contained, and to otherwise comply
with the terms of this Agreement and consummate the Contemplated Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Confio and the Equity Holder
Representative, on behalf of the Confio Equity Holders, agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist SolarWinds, Confio or its or their
designee, in every reasonable way, to perfect the rights of SolarWinds or
Confio in any Confio Intellectual Property Rights, including the completion
and filing of any patent, trademark or copyright applications with the PTO or
any foreign agency and any assignments related thereto; provided, however, that SolarWinds
shall reimburse the Equity Holder Representative for any filing fees incurred
by the Equity Holder Representative in connection with such matters.

ARTICLE VII 

ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The Indemnifying
Party's Liability for Damages resulting from breaches of representations and
warranties shall survive the Closing and continue until that date that is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing:

(i) claims for indemnification based on breaches of representations and
warranties in connection with Section 4.11 (Taxes) shall survive through and
until that date that is thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (the "Statute of Limitation Claims"); and

warranties in connection with Section 4.1 (Confio Corporate Organization;
Standing and Power), Section 4.2 (Capitalization), Section 4.3(a) and (b)(i)
(Authority), Section 4.21 (Brokers or Finders), and fraud, shall survive
indefinitely (collectively, the "Indefinite Claims").

The Statute of Limitation Claims and Indefinite Claims are collectively the
"Surviving Claims." Unless otherwise specified herein, covenants in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until such covenants are fully performed
by the applicable Party or waived by the beneficiaries thereof.

7.2 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the provisions of Section 7.1
and Section 7.3, the Confio Equity Holders (the "Indemnifying Parties"),
severally (in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares), and not
jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless SolarWinds, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates, and their stockholders, directors, officers,
employees and agents (the "Indemnified Parties") against, and reimburse them
for, any actual Liability, damage, loss, obligation, demand, judgment, fine,
penalty, cost or expense (including reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees and
expenses, and the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation incurred in
defending against or settling such Liability, damage, loss, cost or expense or
claim therefor and any amounts paid in settlement thereof) imposed on or
reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Parties (collectively, the "Damages")
as a result of (i) any breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant on the part of Confio, certain matters disclosed on the Confio
Disclosure Schedule identified in Section 7.3(b)(v) below and any failure by
Confio to obtain the third party consents, approvals, authorizations, Permits
and waivers pursuant to Section 3.4(c)(i) (provided, however, that this
Section 7.2(a) shall not constitute in any way a waiver of the Section
3.4(c)(i) closing condition), (ii) fraud by Confio, (iii) Taxes, as provided
in Section 7.2(b) to the extent such Taxes have not been deducted in the
calculation of the Purchase Price (it being the intent of the Parties that all of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
interpreted to avoid requiring the Confio Equity Holders to pay twice for the
same Tax or other Liability), (iv) any claim by any former or other equity
interest owner of Confio for any transaction prior to the Effective Time
involving Confio Capital Stock or other equity interests of Confio, (v) any
expenses or payments of Confio incurred in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions prior to Closing but not included in the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet, and (vi) any Working Capital
Shortfall Amount as finally determined in accordance with Section 3.2.

(b) The obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under Section 7.2(a) shall
extend to (A) all Taxes of Confio with respect to taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and (B) all Taxes of Confio with respect to Straddle
Periods to the extent that such Taxes are allocable to the period prior to
Closing pursuant to Section 6.5(b) but excluding any Taxes resulting from any
action taken by SolarWinds or its Affiliates outside the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date or after Closing with respect to Confio. Such
obligations shall be without regard to whether there was any breach of any
representation or warranty under Article IV with respect to such Tax or any
disclosures that may have been made with respect to Article IV or otherwise.
The indemnification obligations under this Section 7.2(b) shall apply even if
the additional Tax liability results from the filing of a Tax Return or
amended Tax Return with respect to a pre-Closing Date transaction or period
(or portion of a period) by SolarWinds as permitted by this Agreement.
SolarWinds shall not cause or permit Confio to file an amended Tax Return with
respect to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period unless (i) the Equity Holder Representative provides its prior
written consent to the filing of such amended Tax Return, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (ii) SolarWinds
obtains a written legal opinion from independent counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Equity Holder Representative that such amendment is legally required to
be filed by a Governmental Entity pursuant to the resolution of any Tax audit
or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes (provided, further,
that such legal opinion may not assume any facts that are disputed in good
faith by the Equity Holder Representative). In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Section 7.2(b) and any other provision of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall control.

(c) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to this Article VII shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by SolarWinds and the Equity Holders and their respective
Affiliates on their Tax returns to the extent permitted by Law.

7.3 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. The rights of an Indemnified
Party to indemnification under Section 7.2 are subject to the following
limitations:

(a) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover Damages under
Section 7.2 until the cumulative amount of Damages claimed by the Indemnified
Parties exceeds $500,000.00, in which case, such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for all Damages in excess of (but not including)
such amount subject to the limitations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the limitations contained in this Section 7.3(a) shall not apply to
Excluded Damages, as defined below, and any Excluded Damages shall not be
included in determining the cumulative Damages under this Section 7.3(a). (b) Except for injunctive relief and similar equitable remedies and except for
Damages relating to or arising out of:

(i)fraud by Confio,



(ii)any breach of the Surviving Claims by Confio,



(iii)any payment due SolarWinds under Section 6.5,



(iv)claims set forth in Section 7.2(a)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) above
(collectively, subparts (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the "Excluded Damages"),
and



(v)(A) breaches of Section 4.10(o) and all matters disclosed on Section
4.10(o) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule (if any disclosed); and (B) breaches
of Sections 4.10(w)(iii), (iv) or (v) and all matters disclosed on Part II of
Section 4.10(w)(iv) and Section 4.10(v) of the Confio Disclosure Schedule;
(collectively, subparts (A) and (B), the "Customer Contract Damages"),



recourse to the Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be
the Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy available for any Damages
under Section 7.2, subject to the below provisions of this Section 7.3;
provided, however, that with respect to Excluded Damages and Customer Contract
Damages, the Indemnified Parties shall first seek to satisfy such Excluded
Damages and Customer Contract Damages from the Escrow Fund and, if the Escrow
Fund is insufficient to satisfy such Excluded Damages and Customer Contract
Damages or has been released, then the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to seek recourse from other sources.

(c) The Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable for any Damages to the extent
that such Damages have been reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet and
taken into account in calculating the Closing Working Capital Amount or have
been otherwise recovered by any Indemnified Party or satisfied by any other
Person including, without limitation, as a result of any Indemnified Party
receiving compensation for such Damages pursuant to any policy of insurance
maintained by any Indemnified Party, taking into account any increase in
insurance premiums of SolarWinds. In determining the amount of Damages under
this Agreement, the amount of Damages shall be decreased to take into account
any Tax benefit available to the Indemnified Party as a result of the matter
giving rise to such Damages.

(d) The Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable for Customer Contract Damages
related to items disclosed on Part II of Section 4.10(w)(iv) of the Confio
Disclosure Schedule to the extent such Damages result from SolarWinds not
continuing to perform consistent with Confio's past practice.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Parties shall not have any Liability under any provision of this
Agreement for (i) any Damages consisting of any diminution in value, (ii) any
punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect Damages or (iii) any
Damages consisting of multiples of EBITDA, discounted cash flow or other multiples used to determine the Purchase Price hereunder, except, with respect
to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) to the extent such Damages are payable to a
third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim; provided, however, that Confio
will be liable for any Damages consisting of lost revenue, profits or
earnings, or increased expenses.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall: (i) any Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability with respect to
Damages, other than Excluded Damages and Customer Contract Damages, arising
out of or relating to this Agreement exceed such Confio Equity Holder's Pro
Rata Share of the Escrow Cash; (ii) any Indemnifying Party's liability with
respect to Damages in respect of any indemnification claim hereunder exceed
the product of (A) the amount of such Damages indemnified by all Indemnifying
Parties in respect of any such indemnification claim multiplied by (B) such
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Share; (iii) any Indemnifying Party's aggregate
liability with respect to Damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement
exceed such Indemnifying Party's net proceeds received in connection with the
Merger; or (iv) the Indemnifying Parties' collective aggregate liability with
respect to Damages arising out of or relating this Agreement exceed the
Purchase Price.

7.4 Escrow.

(a) At the Closing, SolarWinds will deposit the Escrow Cash, without any act
of the Equity Holders, with the Escrow Agent, such deposit to constitute an
escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein.
The Escrow Cash may be invested as jointly directed in writing by SolarWinds
and the Equity Holder Representative from time to time. In the absence of
joint written instructions, the Escrow Cash shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in an U.S. Bank, National Association, money market deposit account, as
more fully described on Exhibit J hereto. Any interest, earnings and income
that accrue upon the Escrow Cash during the period of time during which the
Escrow Cash is held in the Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be part of the
Escrow Fund.

(b) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall remain in
existence through and until that date that is eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"). On the date that is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow
Fund to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Confio Equity Holders an
amount equal to (i) $2,500,000.00 of the Escrow Cash less (ii) (A) the amount
paid to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VII for any claims
that have been satisfied from the Escrow Fund prior to such date and (B) any
unsatisfied claims specified in any Damages Certificate (as defined in Section
7.4(d) below). As soon as such claims specified in Section 7.4(b)(ii)(B) have
been resolved (such resolution to be evidenced by the written agreement of
SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative or a final judgment of any
court), and within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Confio Equity Holders the
remaining portion of the amounts specified in Section 7.4(b)(ii)(B), if any,
with such amount to be paid to the Confio Equity Holders in accordance with
each Confio Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share as set forth on the Spreadsheet.

(c) Upon the expiration of the Escrow Period, and within ten (10) Business
Days thereafter, any and all of the remaining Escrow Cash shall be released
from the Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Confio Equity Holders after accounting
for (i) all amounts theretofore validly distributed out of the Escrow Fund to
the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VII and (ii) the retention of
an amount of Escrow Cash equal to such portion of the remaining Escrow Fund
which, subject to the objection of the Equity Holder Representative and the
subsequent resolution of the matter, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Damages Certificate delivered to the Equity Holder
Representative prior to the end of the Escrow Period in accordance with the
terms set forth in this Article VII, which amount shall remain in the Escrow
Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence) until such claims have
been resolved in accordance with the terms hereof. As soon as such claims have
been resolved (such resolution to be evidenced by the written agreement of
SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative or the final judgment of any
court), and within two (2) Business Days thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Confio Equity Holders the
remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any remaining
claims with such amount to be paid to the Confio Equity Holders in accordance
with each Confio Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share as set forth on the
Spreadsheet.

(d) In the event that any Indemnified Party has determined that it has
incurred or sustained Damages or that it reasonably anticipates that it will
incur or sustain Damages, the Indemnified Party shall, (i) within ten (10)
Business Days of making any such determination, and (ii) prior to any
expiration for making such claim as set forth in Section 7.1, deliver to the
Equity Holder Representative a certificate signed by any officer of the
Indemnified Party (a "Damages Certificate") (A) stating that the Indemnified
Party has incurred or sustained Damages or reasonably anticipates that it
could incur or sustain Damages and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Damages included and the basis for such anticipated
Liability.

(e) The Equity Holder Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days
following its receipt of a Damages Certificate to object to any claim or
claims made in a Damages Certificate. In the event that the Equity Holder
Representative has not objected within such thirty (30) calendar day period to
a Damages Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall remit to the Indemnified
Party an amount of Escrow Cash that is equal to the amount set forth in such
Damages Certificate and the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by such amount. In
the event that the Equity Holder Representative so objects within such thirty
(30) calendar day period, such objection must be in the form of a certificate
signed by the Equity Holder Representative and delivered to the Indemnified
Party (an "Objection Certificate"), which certificate shall set forth the item
or items of Damages in the Damages Certificate to which the Equity Holder
Representative is objecting and a reasonable basis for each such objection.

(f) For a period of fifteen (15) calendar days after the delivery of an
Objection Certificate, the Indemnified Party and the Equity Holder
Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective Parties with respect to each of such claims as are objected to
therein. If such an agreement is reached as to all or any portion of the
Damages that are subject to the Objection Certificate, then a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties and,
where an Indemnified Party is entitled to be compensated from the Escrow Fund,
shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on any such memorandum. (g) For federal and state income tax purposes, SolarWinds, the Confio Equity
Holders and the Escrow Agent agree to treat the Escrow Fund in the following
manner: (i) SolarWinds shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund and
thus shall take into account in filing its income tax returns all items of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Fund, and (ii) the
Escrow Agent shall report the income on the Escrow Fund on Internal Revenue
Service Form 1099 showing the Escrow Agent as payor and SolarWinds as payee.
SolarWinds shall be entitled to reimburse itself from the Escrow Fund, no more
often than quarterly, an amount equal to thirty-six percent (36%) of the net
income allocated to it from the Escrow Fund to enable it to pay its Taxes on
such income. From and after the determination date, SolarWinds and the Confio
Equity Holders shall be treated for Tax purposes as the owners of their
respective portion of the Escrow Fund as set forth in a statement provided to
the Escrow Agent, and thus each of SolarWinds and the Confio Equity Holders
shall take into account in filing its income tax returns its share of the
items of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Fund. Any
amount distributed from the Escrow Fund to the Confio Stockholders shall be
treated as a payment pursuant to SolarWinds' obligation to the Confio
Stockholders arising from the Confio Stockholders' sale of the Business to
which the installment sale provisions of Section 453 of the Code and the
unstated interest provisions of Section 483 or 1274 of the Code apply. Each of
SolarWinds and the Confio Equity Holders shall provide the Escrow Agent with a
completed IRS Form W-9 indicating its taxpayer identification number. Neither
SolarWinds nor the Confio Equity Holders shall take any position for federal
or state income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 7.4(g).

7.5 Third Party Claims.

(a) In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party claim
that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand for
indemnification hereunder or for the assignment of, a license to, or the
placement in escrow of, the Source Code (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Equity Holder Representative of such claim
as soon as reasonably practicable, and, in any event, within ten (10) calendar
days after the Indemnified Party has received notice or otherwise learns of
the assertion of such Third Party Claim, and the Equity Holder Representative
shall be entitled (but not required), at the expense of the Confio Equity
Holders, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct except to the
extent provided in Section 7.5(b), the defense of such claim; provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the
Equity Holder Representative shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Confio Equity
Holders are thereby prejudiced.

(b) The Equity Holder Representative will have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i) the Equity
Holder Representative notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty
(30) Business Days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against the entirety of any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Equity Holder Representative provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have the financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the Third Party Claim involves
only monetary damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable
relief, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third
Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Parties,
likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the
continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, and (v) the Equity
Holder Representative conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim in a
commercially reasonably manner. The Equity Holder Representative will not
consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement agreement
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
judgment or settlement includes a full release of the Indemnified Party in
respect of all indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom, related thereto or
arising therefrom.

(c) In the event any of the conditions in Section 7.5(b) above is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem reasonably appropriate
(and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from,
the Equity Holder Representative in connection therewith), (ii) the
Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly for the costs
of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) upon the resolution of any such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Damages the Indemnified
Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this
Article VII.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.5,
SolarWinds shall have the right to control and make all decisions regarding
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Taxes, including selection of counsel and selection of a forum for such
contest; provided, however, that in the event such audit or proceeding relates
to Taxes for which the Confio Equity Holders are responsible and have agreed
to indemnify SolarWinds, (i) SolarWinds, Confio and the Equity Holder
Representative shall cooperate in the conduct of any audit or proceeding
relating to such period, (ii) the Equity Holder Representative shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to participate in such audit or proceeding at
the Confio Equity Holders' expense, (iii) SolarWinds shall not enter into any
agreement with the relevant Governmental Entity pertaining to such Taxes
without the written consent of the Equity Holder Representative, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, and (iv) SolarWinds may, without the
written consent of the Equity Holder Representative, enter into such an
agreement provided that SolarWinds shall have agreed in writing to accept
responsibility and liability for the payment of such Taxes and to forego any
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Taxes. The Parties
will keep each other reasonably informed as to matters related to any audit or
judicial or administrative proceedings involving Taxes for which
indemnification may be sought hereunder including, without limitation, any
settlement negotiations.

(e) Refunds of Tax relating to periods ending prior to the Closing Date (or to
that portion of a Straddle Period that is prior to Closing under the
principles of Section 6.5(b) shall be the property of the Confio Equity
Holders, but only to the extent that such refunds are not attributable to (i) net operating loss or other carrybacks from periods ending
after the Closing Date, (ii) refund claims that are initiated by SolarWinds
(provided that SolarWinds gives the Equity Holder Representative prior notice
of such possible claim and the Equity Holder Representative declines to pursue
such refund at his own expense) or (iii) refunds reflected in the calculation
of the Purchase Price; provided, however, that SolarWinds shall in no event
have an obligation to file or cause to be filed a claim for refund with
respect to any Taxes relating to any period. SolarWinds shall pay any refunds
that are the property of the Confio Equity Holders to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Confio Equity Holders, in immediately available funds and
in accordance with each Confio Equity Holder's Pro Rata Share within five (5)
Business Days of its receiving such refund (or realizing a Tax benefit
attributable thereto) from the appropriate Governmental Authority.

(f) The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in any defense, compromise or settlement, subject to this Section 7.5
including, without limitation, by making available all pertinent books,
records and other information and personnel under its control to the
Indemnifying Party.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.5,
SolarWinds shall have the sole right to control and make all decisions
regarding any Third Party Claim involving a material past, current or future
Confio customer or vendor; provided, however, that in the event the Confio
Equity Holders are responsible and have agreed to indemnify SolarWinds for
such Third Party Claim, (i) SolarWinds, Confio, and the Confio Equity Holders
shall cooperate in the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, (ii) the
Confio Equity Holders shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
participate in the defense, compromise or settlement thereof at the Confio
Equity Holders' expense, and (iii) any compromise or settlement by SolarWinds
shall be approved by the Equity Holder Representative, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 7.6 Exclusive Remedy. Absent fraud, the indemnification provisions contained
in this Article VII are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy
following the Closing as to all Damages any Indemnified Party may incur
arising from or relating this Agreement, the Merger or the Contemplated
Transactions (it being understood that nothing in this Section 7.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect (a) the Parties' rights to specific
performance or other equitable remedies with respect to the covenants in this
Agreement to be performed at or after the Closing or (b) the right of the
Confio Equity Holders to bring an action at law for any breach of this
Agreement by SolarWinds).

7.7 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnified Parties other than SolarWinds. No
Indemnified Party (other than SolarWinds or any successors thereto or
assignees thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or
exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless SolarWinds (or any
successors thereto or assignees thereof) shall have consented to the assertion
of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

7.8 Escrow Agent's Duties.

(a) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of SolarWinds
and the Equity Holder Representative (the "Duties"). Such Duties shall include
the following: (i) safeguarding and treating the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement and not as the property of SolarWinds,
and holding the Escrow Fund in a separate account, apart from any other funds
or accounts of the Escrow Agent or any other Person and (ii) holding and
disposing of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Duties of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Fund may
be altered, amended, modified or revoked only by a writing signed by
SolarWinds, the Escrow Agent and the Equity Holder Representative.

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
notices given by any of the Parties hereto or by any other Person inconsistent
with this Agreement, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is
hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or
decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such
order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to any of the Parties hereto or to any other Person by reason of such
compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have
been entered without jurisdiction.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the Parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

(d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent. (e) The Escrow Agent may resign as Escrow Agent at any time with or without
cause by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice to
each of SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative, such resignation to
be effective thirty (30) calendar days following the date such notice is
given. In addition, SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative may
jointly remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without
cause, by an instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the
Escrow Agent, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such
removal. In the event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow
agent which shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the
United States of America or any state thereof having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than $100,000,000.00, shall be jointly appointed by
SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative in writing. Any such successor
escrow agent shall deliver to SolarWinds and the Equity Holder Representative
a written instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon it shall
succeed to all the rights and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder and shall
be entitled to receive the Escrow Fund. Thereafter, the predecessor Escrow
Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and Liabilities under this
Agreement.

(f) In performing any duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to any Party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall not incur any such Liability for any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible if
acting in good faith for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the
scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may
consult with legal counsel in connection with the Escrow Agent's duties under
this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The
Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of
any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any Party to this
Agreement.

(g) If any controversy arises between the Parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action
regarding it. The Escrow Agent shall await the decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction and act to make or withhold payments out of the Escrow
Fund in accordance with such decision.

(h) In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder or in any notice,
instruction or other communication received by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the
Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action other
than retaining possession of the Escrow Fund, unless the Escrow Agent receives
written instructions, signed by SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representative, that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty.

(i) SolarWinds, the Equity Holder Representative (on behalf of the Confio
Equity Holders and not individually) and their respective successors and
assigns, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, Liabilities, and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on the Escrow Agent or incurred by the
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this
Agreement.

(j) All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall
be paid one-half (1/2) by SolarWinds and one-half (1/2) by the Confio Equity
Holders in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent as
set forth on Exhibit K hereto. It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the Parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if a
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes
in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the
Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services
and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys' fees, including allocated costs of
in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy
or litigation.

(k) Any extraordinary fees and expenses, including, without limitation, any
fees or expenses (including the fees or expenses of outside counsel to the
Escrow Agent) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with a dispute over
the distribution of Escrow Cash or the validity of a Damages Certificate or
Objection Certificate shall, unless otherwise ordered by the applicable
arbitrator, be paid one-half (1/2) by the Confio Equity Holders and one-half
(1/2) by SolarWinds within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a written
invoice from the Escrow Agent accompanied by evidence of a written invoice for
such fees and expenses received by the Escrow Agent.

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of SolarWinds and the Equity Holder
Representative as duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of SolarWinds and
Confio;

(b) by Confio or SolarWinds, at any time after October 30, 2013 if the Closing
shall have not occurred by such date (the "Termination Date");

(c) by Confio or SolarWinds, if any court of competent jurisdiction or any
Governmental Entity shall have issued a final order restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and

Dissenting Stockholders; or

Section 6.9 with respect to the termination of this Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal with a third party, and upon the payment provided in Section

the Merger by Confio or SolarWinds pursuant to this Article VIII, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party.

and no Party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation
arising under this Agreement to any other Party hereto, except as provided in
Section 8.3(b) and Sections 9.14 and 9.15 hereof, which provisions shall
survive such termination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.3
shall prejudice any rights, claims or causes of action that may have accrued
hereunder or with respect hereto prior to the date of such termination arising
from any Party's willful breach of this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Confio pursuant to Section 8.1(g) in
order to enter into a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement relating to a Superior Proposal, then Confio shall pay to SolarWinds
an amount in cash equal to $3,500,000.00 promptly following such termination.
Any payment made pursuant to the preceding sentence to SolarWinds shall be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of SolarWinds and Merger Sub resulting from
such termination of this Agreement by Confio.

9.2 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits,
Schedules or Sections, such reference shall be to an Exhibit, Schedule or
Section to or of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Any reference to
any Law will be deemed also to refer to such Law as in effect on the date
hereof and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation"
or "but not limited to" or words of similar import. Pronouns in the masculine,
feminine and neuter genders will be construed to include any other gender, and
words in the singular form will be construed to include the plural and vice
versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The words "this Agreement,"
"herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder," and words of similar import refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless
expressly so limited. In this Agreement, any reference to any event, change,
condition or effect being "material" with respect to any entity or group of
entities taken as a whole means any material event, change, condition or
effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets
(including intangible assets), Liabilities, business, prospects, operations or
results of operations of such entity or group of entities. The phrase "made
available" in this Agreement shall mean that the information referred to has
been made available if requested by the Party to whom such information is to
be made available. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

9.3 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, together
with the other Transaction Documents and the documents and instruments and
other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto,
including the Exhibits and the Schedules (including the Confio Disclosure
Schedule) (a) constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings and representations, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) is not intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as
provided herein and except that (i) the Confio Equity Holders shall have all
rights hereunder with respect to payment of the Purchase Price and (ii) the
directors and officers of Confio shall have the rights set forth in Section
6.7.

9.4 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.5 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, including the
sole and exclusive remedy provision of Section 7.6, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

9.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and all claims and causes of
action arising hereunder or relating hereto shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
applicable principles of conflicts of law. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court located within the State of Delaware, in connection
with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons and waives
and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise
have to such jurisdiction and such process.

9.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.8 Assignability. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void, except that (a) SolarWinds may
assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of SolarWinds without the prior written
consent of any other Party; provided, however, that SolarWinds shall remain
liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement, and (b) this Agreement
and any of the rights, interests, or obligations incurred hereunder, in part
or as a whole, are assignable by the Confio Equity Holders upon the prior
written consent of SolarWinds, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.9 Rules of Construction. The Parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

9.10 Fees. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, in the event of
any suit or other proceeding to construe or enforce any provision of this
Agreement or any other agreement to be entered into pursuant hereto, or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing Party's or
Parties' reasonable legal, accounting and other fees and costs (in addition to
all other amounts and relief to which such Party or Parties may be entitled)
incurred in such suit or proceeding shall be paid by the non-prevailing Party
or Parties.

9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which will be deemed an original but all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement. The Agreement shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. 9.12 Telecopy Execution and Delivery. A facsimile, telecopy or other
reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more Parties to this
Agreement, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or
more Parties to this Agreement by facsimile or similar electronic transmission
device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such Party can be
seen, and such execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and
effective for all purposes. At the request of any Party to this Agreement, all
Parties to this Agreement agree to execute an original of this Agreement as
well as any facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement.

9.13 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification, waiver, replacement,
termination or cancellation of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by SolarWinds and the Equity
Holder Representative. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, will operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising from this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver will not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

9.14 Transaction Expenses. Confio, SolarWinds and the Confio Equity Holders
will bear their own costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the Contemplated Transactions; provided, however, that the
obligation to pay Taxes shall be allocated pursuant to Section 6.5, the
obligation to pay expenses in connection with the Escrow Fund shall be
allocated pursuant to Section 7.8 and certain transaction expenses of Confio
as paid in accordance with Section 3.5(b)(iv).

9.15 Public Announcements. SolarWinds, Confio, and each of their Affiliates
will, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law or court process.

9.16 USA Patriot Act Compliance. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
Person who opens an account. For a non-individual Person such as a business
entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for
documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority
to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The Parties each
agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as
requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law, including without limitation, the
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001.

9.17 Representation. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers and
Affiliates that Confio is the client of Roberts and Olivia, LLC (the "Firm"),
and not of any Stockholder or Option Holder in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. After the Closing, it is possible that the Firm
will represent one or more Stockholders, one or more Option Holders, the
Equity Holder Representative and their respective Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the "Seller Group") in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions under this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document and any
claims made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document. SolarWinds and Confio hereby agree that the Firm (or any successor)
may represent the Seller Group in the future in connection with issues that
may arise under this Agreement, any other Transaction Document and any claims
that may be made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document. The Firm (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all
or a portion of the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, officer,
employee, representative or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with
any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the Contemplated Transactions.
Each of the Parties consents thereto, and waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each such Party shall cause any Affiliate thereof to
consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.
Each of the Parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary,
that it has been carefully considered, and that the Parties have consulted
with counsel or have been advised they should do so in this connection.
