                                     Option

     2.1 Grant of Option. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Scalable Software hereby grants to NEON Systems an irrevocable option (the
"Option") to merge Scalable Software with and into NEON Systems (the "Merger")
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL").

Option, all existing bridge loans from NEON Systems to Scalable Software shall
be converted into a term loan (the "Term Loan"), effective as of the date of
this Agreement and with the other terms and conditions set forth in the Term

Software additional loans aggregating $5,500,000, which may be advanced to
Scalable Software in increments of $450,000 per month as described in the Term
Loan Financing Documents.

     2.3 Option Term. The Option shall be exercisable at any time during a
two-year term from the date of this Agreement (the "Option Term"), subject to
the provisions set forth in Section 2.5. If the Option has not been exercised

<PAGE>

     2.4 Exercise of Option. Subject to Section 2.5, if NEON Systems intends to
exercise the Option during the Option Term, it may do so only by delivery, prior
to the expiration of the Option Term, of a written notice (an "Exercise Notice")
(the date of which being herein referred to as the "Notice Date") to Scalable
Software specifying a date (as it may be extended from time to time, the
"Exercise Date") not earlier than 30 days from the Notice Date for the exercise
of the Option; provided, however, that NEON Systems shall have received the
approval of the Special Committee prior to exercising the Option. Upon delivery
of the Exercise Notice, Scalable Software may update the Disclosure Schedule.
NEON Systems may exercise the Option by delivery of an additional written notice
to Scalable Software on the date specified in the Exercise Notice.

     2.5 Exercise Events.

     (a) If the current price per share of the NEON Systems Common Stock on the
principal national securities exchange, if any, or the Nasdaq National Market or
other NASDAQ market, or any successor thereto, on which the NEON Systems Common
Stock is listed or admitted to trading exceeds $10.00 for 30 consecutive Trading
Days (the "Trading Period"), then within five Trading Days after the end of the
Trading Period, NEON Systems must deliver to Scalable Software an Exercise
Notice. If NEON Systems does not deliver an Exercise Notice within five Trading
Days after the end of the Trading Period, then the rights and obligations set
forth in this Agreement shall expire and terminate. The current price per share
of NEON Systems Common Stock for any Trading Day will be the closing price on
that day or, if no sale of NEON Systems Common Stock takes place on that day as
reported by the applicable exchange or market system, the average of the closing
bid and asked prices on that Trading Day as so reported.

     (b) If, prior to the exercise of the Option, Scalable Software receives a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal that is not subject to any conditions (other than
the condition that Scalable Software's obligations pursuant to this Agreement
have been terminated) that the Board of Directors of Scalable Software has
determined to accept subject to Scalable Software's obligations under this
Agreement, then Scalable Software shall deliver a written notice to NEON
Systems. The written notice shall set forth the name and address of the
prospective acquiror and the per share purchase price offered by the prospective
acquiror. NEON Systems shall have 30 days after receipt of written notice that
the Board of Directors of Scalable Software has made such a determination to
elect to exercise the Option. NEON Systems shall have the choice, in its sole
discretion, to elect to exercise the Option at the same price as set forth in
the Acquisition Proposal. If NEON Systems does not deliver an Exercise Notice to
Scalable Software within 30 days after the date of receipt of the written notice
from Scalable Software, then the rights and obligations set forth in this
Agreement shall expire and terminate.

     For purposes of Section 2.5(a): (i) the current price per share will be
adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock
splits and the like, (ii) references to the NEON Systems Common Stock at any
time also refer to any Equivalent Security theretofore issued, directly or
indirectly, in respect of the NEON Systems Common Stock then outstanding and
(iii) in the case of any Equivalent Security, the price per share thereof will
be equitably adjusted to reflect the exchange or other action by means of which
that Equivalent Security was exchanged, directly or indirectly, for NEON Systems
Common Stock.

provided in this Article II, the parties shall proceed with the Merger in

     2.7 Right of First Refusal With Respect to Scalable Software Financings.
If, during the Option Term, Scalable Software receives a bona fide offer from a
third party for a financing of Scalable Software that the Board of Directors of
Scalable Software has determined to accept subject to Scalable Software's
obligations under this Agreement, then Scalable Software shall deliver a written
notice to NEON Systems. The written notice shall set forth the name and address
of the entity proposing the financing, as well as the terms of the financing.
NEON Systems shall have 30 days after receipt of the written notice that the
Board of Directors of Scalable Software has made such a determination to provide
financing to Scalable Software on the equal terms to the proposed financing from
the third party. If NEON Systems does not provide financing on equal terms to
Scalable Software within the 30-day period following receipt of the notice,
Scalable Software may accept the terms of the third party financing. This
provision shall not apply to financing obtained by means of the exercise of
options and warrants outstanding as of the date hereof or hereafter issued
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III
                        Closing and Post Closing Matters

     Upon the exercise of the Option as provided in Article II, the provisions
of this Article III shall become effective and binding on the parties hereto;
prior to such exercise, the provisions of this Article III shall have no force
or effect.

     3.1 The Merger.

     (a) In reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties set forth herein and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Scalable Software shall be merged
with and into NEON Systems in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate
existence of Scalable Software shall cease, and NEON Systems shall be the
surviving corporation and, as such, will, all with the effect the DGCL provides,
possess all the properties and rights, and be subject to all the restrictions
and duties, of Scalable Software and NEON Systems and be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware.

     (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, NEON Systems shall (i) file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware which
contains the information the DGCL requires to effect the Merger and (ii) make
all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the date stamped by the Secretary
of State of Delaware upon that certificate of merger (such date is referred to
as the "Effective Date"). On the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of capital stock of Scalable
Software or NEON Systems: (i) each share of capital stock of Scalable Software
which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date and
owned by Scalable Software shall automatically


                                       8

<PAGE>

be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor; and (ii) each share of Scalable Software New
Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Date, other than shares to be canceled pursuant to the preceding clause (i),
shall convert into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable to the
holder thereof pursuant to Section 3.2.

     (c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of NEON Systems, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall continue in full force and
effect as the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of NEON Systems, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, until duly amended in accordance with their
terms and applicable law.

     (d) The directors and officers of NEON Systems from and after the Effective
Date and until the earlier to occur of their death, removal, resignation or
retirement or the due election or appointment of their successors will be as set
forth on Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     (e) The Merger is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party agrees that it will not take or assert
any position on any tax return, report or otherwise which is inconsistent with
the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The provisions and representations contained or
referred to in this Section 3.1(e) shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

     (f) Subject to the closing conditions set forth herein, the closing under
this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place as soon as practicable following
satisfaction or waiver by the applicable party of all conditions to Closing set
forth in Article X (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Vinson & Elkins
L.L.P., 2300 First City Tower, 1001 Fannin Street, Houston, unless a different
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement.

     3.2 Merger Consideration.

     (a) At the Effective Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, including without limitation thereto the conditions to Closing
set forth in Article X hereof, each issued and outstanding share of Scalable
Software New Common Stock shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and
converted, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, into the right
to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and upon
the surrender of the certificate evidencing such share, a fraction of a fully
paid nonassessable share of issued and outstanding NEON Systems Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio, which shall be appropriately adjusted for any
recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the
like that are effected with respect to the Scalable Software New Common Stock or
the NEON Systems Common Stock after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Date. The shares of NEON Systems Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger are hereinafter referred to as the "NEON Systems
Shares" or the "Merger Consideration." No fractional NEON Systems Shares shall
be issued in the Merger. To the extent the application of the Exchange Ratio
would result in a fractional number of NEON Systems Shares being issued to a
holder of Scalable Software New Common Stock in the Merger, the number of NEON


                                       9

<PAGE>

Systems Shares issuable in the Merger shall be rounded down to the next whole
number. For purposes of determining whether a fractional share otherwise would
be issuable, the total number of NEON Systems Shares issuable to any former
holder of Scalable Software New Common Stock shall be determined on the basis of
the total number of shares of Scalable Software New Common Stock which were
registered in the name of that holder if represented by more than one stock
certificate. Payment of the Merger Consideration to all stockholders of Scalable
Software shall be made as set forth in Section 2.2(b); provided, however, that
10% of the whole NEON Systems Shares will be placed in escrow pursuant the
Escrow Agreement.

     (b) After the Effective Date, each holder (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares, as defined and to the extent provided in Section 3.3) of an outstanding
certificate that prior thereto represented shares of Scalable Software New
Common Stock shall be entitled, upon surrender thereof to NEON Systems, to
receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate or certificates representing the
number of whole shares of NEON Systems Common Stock into which the shares so
surrendered shall have been converted as described above, in such denominations
and registered in such names as such holder may request, less the shares of NEON
Systems Common Stock that will be issued and deposited for the account of such
person as Escrow Stock (as defined below), if any. On the Effective Date, NEON
Systems shall issue and deliver to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (the "Escrow Agent")
and deposit pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, for the account and future
potential benefit of the Scalable Software stockholders whose names are set
forth on Exhibit B (the "Escrow Stockholders") a number of shares of NEON
Systems Common Stock equal to 10% of the aggregate number of NEON Systems Shares
(the "Escrow Stock"). In addition to the conditions set forth in the Escrow
Agreement, no Scalable Software stockholder shall be entitled to any
disbursements of Escrow Stock unless and until such stockholder surrenders the
certificates that prior to the Effective Date represented shares of Scalable
Software New Common Stock convertible into NEON Systems Shares in accordance
with the Exchange Ratio. Until surrendered, each outstanding certificate that,
prior to the Effective Date, represented shares of Scalable Software New Common
Stock shall be deemed from and after the Effective Date, for all corporate
purposes, other than the payment of earlier dividends and distributions, to
evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of NEON Systems Common Stock
into which such shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Section 3.2.
Unless and until any such outstanding certificates shall be surrendered, no
dividends or other distributions payable to the holders of NEON Systems Common
Stock, as of any time on or after the Effective Date, shall be paid to the
holders of such outstanding certificates which prior to the Effective Date
represented shares of Scalable Software New Common Stock; provided, however,
that, upon surrender and exchange of such outstanding certificates, there shall
be paid to the record holders of the certificates issued and exchanged therefor,
the amount, without interest thereon, of dividends and other distributions, if
any, that theretofore were declared and became payable since the Effective Date
with respect to the number of full shares of NEON Systems Common Stock issued to
such holders.

     (c) As of the Effective Date, all shares of Scalable Software New Common
Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each
holder of any such shares shall cease to have any


                                       10

<PAGE>

rights with respect thereto or arising therefrom (including without limitation
the right to vote), except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with this
Section 3.2, and until so surrendered, each such certificate shall represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

     3.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Scalable Software New Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares")
that are held by stockholders who have not consented in writing pursuant to
Section 228 of the DGCL to the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement and
who, within 20 days after the mailing of the notice informing such stockholders
of their appraisal rights, have delivered to the surviving corporation a written
notice of their intention to dissent from approval of the Merger and the
Agreement and obtain payment for their shares, and who have delivered to the
surviving corporation a written demand for payment of the fair value of such
shares and deposited certificates representing such shares, each in the manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, shall not be converted into the right to
receive, or be exchangeable for the Merger Consideration set forth in Section
3.2 hereof, but shall instead entitle the holders thereof to payment of the fair
value of such shares as determined by the surviving corporation, with interest
if any has accrued, as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
which fair value may be challenged by such stockholder by a timely demand for an
appraisal as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL.

     3.4 Documents. On the Closing Date, NEON Systems, Scalable Software and
each of the Principal Stockholders shall execute and deliver all appropriate
documents and instruments to effectuate the transactions as set forth in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

     3.5 Scalable Software Options.

     (a) At the Effective Date, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, each Scalable Software Option (whether or not then
exercisable) granted under the Scalable Software Option Plan, which remains as
of such time unexercised in whole or in part, shall be assumed by NEON Systems
and become an option (an "Assumed Option") to purchase that number of shares of
NEON Systems Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of
Scalable Software New Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Scalable
Software Option by the Exchange Ratio at an exercise price per share equal to
the per share exercise price of such Scalable Software Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio. If the foregoing calculation results in an Assumed Option being
exercisable for a fraction of a share of NEON Systems Common Stock, the number
of shares of NEON Systems Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and the total exercise price
for such Assumed Option shall be reduced by the exercise price of the fractional
share. The Assumed Option (i) shall provide the optionee with the same vesting
and other rights that he had under the Scalable Software Option before such
assumption and (ii) shall not give the optionee additional vesting or other
rights that he did not have under the Scalable Software Option before such
assumption.

     (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, NEON Systems shall
deliver to the holders of the Scalable Software Options appropriate agreements
evidencing NEON Systems' assumption of such options.


                                       11

<PAGE>

     (c) At the Effective Date, NEON Systems shall assume the Scalable Software
Option Plan with such amendments thereto as may be required to reflect the
Merger, including, without limitation, the substitution of NEON Systems Common
Stock for Scalable Software New Common Stock thereunder. Scalable Software
hereby assigns to NEON Systems, and NEON Systems hereby assumes from Scalable
Software, in each case effective as of the Effective Date, all Scalable
Software's repurchase rights under the Scalable Software Option Plan.

     (d) The Board of Directors of Scalable Software (or a duly appointed
committee thereof responsible for the administration of the Scalable Software
Option Plan in accordance with the terms of such plan) shall, prior to or as of
the Effective Date, take all necessary actions, pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of the Scalable Software Option Plan and the instruments
evidencing the Scalable Software Options, to provide (i) for the conversion of
the Scalable Software Options into the Assumed Options in accordance with
subparagraph (a) above and (ii) that no consent of the holders of the Scalable
Software Options is required in connection with such conversions.

     (e) Within 30 days of the Closing, NEON Systems shall deliver to the
holders of Scalable Software Options an option agreement duly executed by it for
each Assumed Option.

     (e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, NEON Systems shall
file with the Commission under the Securities Act a registration statement on
Form S-8 to register the shares of NEON Systems Common Stock issuable on the
exercise of the Assumed Options and thereafter shall maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement under the Securities Act.

     3.6 Scalable Software Warrants. At the Effective Date, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Scalable Software
Warrant that remains as of such time unexercised in whole or in part shall be
assumed by NEON Systems and become a warrant (an "Assumed Warrant") to purchase
that number of shares of NEON Systems Common Stock obtained by multiplying the
number of shares of Scalable Software New Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Scalable Software Warrant by the Exchange Ratio at an exercise
price per share equal to the per share exercise price of such Scalable Software
Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio. If the foregoing calculation results in
an Assumed Warrant being exercisable for a fraction of a share of NEON Systems
Common Stock, the number of shares of NEON Systems Common Stock subject to such
Assumed Warrant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and
the total exercise price for such Assumed Warrant shall be reduced by the
exercise price of the fractional share.

                                   ARTICLE IV

other party informed as to the status of any such investigation, action or legal
proceeding; and (iv) promptly inform the other party of any communication to or

will consult and cooperate with the other party and will consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted
in connection

the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the filing of the Proxy Statement

approval of the stockholders at the NEON Systems Stockholders Meeting. Such
information provided by Scalable Software will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Scalable
Software will advise NEON Systems promptly in writing if prior to the Closing
Date it should obtain knowledge of any facts that would make it necessary to
amend the Proxy Statement in order to render the statements therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law.

     9.3 Tax Treatment. All parties intend the Merger to be a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and agree to
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all action required or
appropriate to facilitate such tax treatment.

     9.4 Further Assurances. After the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Scalable Software will, and after the date of this Agreement and prior
to and following the Closing, NEON Systems will cooperate fully with the other
parties and to execute such further instruments, documents and agreements and to
give such further written assurances, as may be reasonably requested by any
other party to better evidence and reflect the transactions described herein and
contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents and purposes of this
Agreement.

Systems shall provide, or cause to be provided to, the employees of Scalable
Software an employer matching contribution formula under a 401(k) plan that is

Plan immediately prior to the Closing. However, nothing herein shall prevent
NEON Systems from changing such contribution formula after the transition period
provided by Section 410(b)(6)(C) of the Code, provided that the employer
contribution formula thereafter applicable to the employees of Scalable
Solutions is not less favorable than that applicable to the employees of NEON
Systems.

          (a) by mutual consent of the parties to this Agreement;

          (b) by either NEON Systems or Scalable Software if:

                                  ARTICLE XII
                    Survival of Representations, Warranties,
                            Covenants and Agreements

     All statements of fact contained in any written statement (including
financial statements), certificate, instrument or document delivered by or on
behalf of Scalable Software pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties of Scalable Software. The several representations
and warranties of the parties to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date

representations and warranties


                                       36

<PAGE>

shall survive being referred to herein with respect to such representations and
warranties as the "Survival Period"), and shall be effective with respect to any
inaccuracy therein or breach thereof (and a claim for indemnification under
Article XIII or Article XIV hereof may be made thereon) if a written notice
asserting the claim shall have been given within the Survival Period with
respect to such matter. Any claim for indemnification made during the Survival
Period shall be valid and the representations and warranties relating thereto

                                  ARTICLE XIII
   Indemnification by Scalable Software and the Scalable Software Stockholders

     13.1 Indemnification by Scalable Software and the Scalable Software
Stockholders.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article XIII, Scalable
Software and each stockholder of Scalable Software, (each, an "Indemnitor")
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless NEON Systems and its respective
directors, officers, employees and controlled and controlling persons (each, an
"Indemnitee") from and against all Losses asserted against, imposed upon, or
incurred by, paid or suffered by any Indemnitee, directly or indirectly, by
reason of, arising out of, or resulting from the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Scalable Software contained in or made pursuant to
this Agreement.

     (b) No Indemnitee will be entitled to, and shall not seek, indemnification
from any Indemnitor pursuant to this Article XIII on the basis of any
representation and warranty of Scalable Software unless such Indemnitee shall
have delivered to the Escrow Representative prior to the first anniversary of
the Effective Date a written claim for such indemnification based on such
representation and warranty (an "Indemnification Claim"). Any Indemnification
Claim so delivered prior to such first anniversary shall remain enforceable
under this Article XIII notwithstanding that it may not be resolved prior to
such first anniversary.

     (c) Except as set forth in Section 13.6, the aggregate liability of the
Indemnitors under this Section 13.1 shall be limited to the Escrow Stock, and
the only recourse of the Indemnitees to such indemnification shall be the Escrow
Stock under the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

     (d) Notwithstanding Section 13.1(a), no Indemnitee shall be entitled to
make any Indemnification Claim against any Indemnitor unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of which all Indemnitees shall have
made Indemnification Claims timely under Section 13.1(b) exceeds $100,000 and,
in such event, only to the extent that such aggregate amount exceeds $100,000.


                                       37

     13.2 Procedures for Indemnification.

     (a) An Indemnification Claim must specify in reasonable detail the basis on
which indemnification is sought and the amount of asserted Losses and, in the
case of a Third Party Claim (as hereinafter defined), contain (by attachment or
otherwise) such other information as the Indemnitee making such Indemnification
Claim shall have concerning such Third Party Claim.

     (b) If the Indemnification Claim involves a Third Party Claim, the
procedures set forth in Section 13.3 shall be observed by the Indemnitee and the
Escrow Representative.

     (c) If the Indemnification Claim involves a matter other than a Third Party
Claim, the Escrow Representative shall have 30 days to object to such
Indemnification Claim by delivery of a written notice of such objection to such
Indemnitee specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection. Failure
to timely so object shall constitute a final and binding acceptance of the
Indemnification Claim by the Escrow Representative on behalf of all Indemnitors,
and the Indemnification Claim shall be paid in accordance with subsection (d)
hereof. If an objection is timely interposed by the Escrow Representative and
the dispute is not resolved by such Indemnitee and the Escrow Representative
within such 30-day period, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration as
provided in Section 13.7.

     (d) Upon determination of the amount of an Indemnification Claim, whether
by agreement between the Escrow Representative and the Indemnitee or by an
arbitration award or by any other final adjudication, the Indemnitee may set off
the amount of such Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Stock in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement within 10 days of the date such amount is determined.

     13.3 Third Party Claims. The obligations and liabilities of the parties
hereunder with respect to any action, arbitration, cause of action, claim,
complaint, criminal prosecution, governmental or other examination or
investigation, hearing, administrative or other proceeding relating to or
affecting a party or its business or assets, or this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case that is instituted against an
Indemnitee by a person or entity other than an Indemnitor and which, if
prosecuted successfully, would result in Losses for which such Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 13.1 (each a "Third Party
Claim") shall be subject to the following provisions of this Section 13.3.

     (a) The Indemnitee shall give the Escrow Representative written notice of a
Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice thereof,
and the Escrow Representative, on behalf of the Indemnitors, may undertake the
defense, compromise and settlement thereof by representatives of its own
choosing reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. The failure of the Indemnitee
to notify the Escrow Representative of such claim shall not relieve the
Indemnitors of any liability that they may have with respect to such claim
except to the extent the Escrow Representative demonstrates that the defense of
such claim is materially prejudiced by such failure. The assumption of the
defense, compromise and settlement of any such Third Party Claim by the Escrow
Representative shall be an acknowledgement of the obligation of the Indemnitors
to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such claim hereunder, unless the
Indemnitor give written notice to the Indemnitee within 30 days after receipt of
the Indemnitee's notice that it disputes its liability to Indemnitee with
respect to such Third Party Claim notwithstanding its assumption of the defense
thereof. If the Indemnitee desires to participate in, but not control, any such
defense,


                                       38

<PAGE>

     compromise and settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If,
     however, the Escrow Representative fails or refuses to undertake the
     defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days after written notice of
     such claim has been given to the Escrow Representative by the Indemnitee,
     the Indemnitee shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
     and settlement of such claim with counsel of its own choosing. In the
     circumstances described in the preceding sentence, the Indemnitee shall,
     promptly upon its assumption of the defense of such claim, be deemed to
     have made an Indemnification Claim as specified in this Section 13.3 which
     is not a Third Party Claim for the purposes of the procedures set forth
     herein.

          (b) If, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee, any Third Party
     Claim or the litigation or resolution thereof involves an issue or matter
     which could reasonably have a material adverse effect on the financial
     condition, business, assets, results of operations or prospects of the
     Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall have the right to control the defense,
     compromise and settlement of such Third Party Claim undertaken by the
     Escrow Representative, and the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of any
     attorney representing the Indemnitee in connection therewith, together with
     the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of any consultant, accountant or
     other party retained by such Indemnitee in connection with the
     aforementioned defense, compromise and settlement, shall be paid by the
     Indemnitors and all other Losses paid, suffered or incurred by the
     Indemnitee resulting from, based upon or arising out of such Third Party
     Claim shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of the
     Indemnitors hereunder. If the Indemnitee shall elect to exercise such
     right, the Escrow Representative shall have the right to participate in,
     but not control, the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third Party
     Claim at its sole cost and expense.

          (c) No settlement of a Third Party Claim involving the asserted
     liability of the Indemnitors under Section 13.1 shall be made without the
     prior written consent by or on behalf of the Escrow Representative, which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Consent shall be
     deemed to have been given where the Escrow Representative has not responded
     within 30 business days of notice of a proposed settlement. If the Escrow
     Representative assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, (i) no
     compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Escrow
     Representative without the Indemnitee's consent unless (A) there is no
     finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights
     of any Person and no effect on any other claim that may be made against the
     Indemnitee, (B) the sole relief provided is damages that are paid in full
     by the Indemnitors with Escrow Stock, and (C) the compromise or settlement
     includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or
     the plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a release, in form and substance
     satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from all liability in respect of such Third
     Party Claim, and (ii) the Indemnitee shall have no liability with respect
     to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its consent.

          (d) In connection with the defense, compromise or settlement of any
     Third Party Claim, the parties shall execute such powers of attorney as may
     reasonably be necessary or appropriate to permit participation of counsel
     selected by any party and, as may reasonably be related to any such claim
     or action, shall provide access to the counsel, accountants and other
     representatives or each party during normal business hours to all
     properties, personnel, books, tax records, contracts, commitments and all
     other business records of such other party


                                       39

<PAGE>

     and will furnish to such other party copies of all such documents as may
     reasonably be requested (certified, if requested).

     13.4 Subrogation. Upon payment in full of any Indemnification Claim,
whether such payment is effected by set-off or otherwise, or the payment of any
judgment or settlement with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitors
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the rights of the
Indemnitee against any person or entity with respect to the subject matter of
such Indemnification Claim or Third Party Claim.

     13.5 Escrow Representative.

     (a) The Escrow Representative shall act as the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact to act for and on behalf of the Indemnitors in all matters
relating to or arising out of this Article XIII and the liability or asserted
liability for such Indemnitor hereunder, including specifically, but without
limitation, accepting and agreeing to the liability of such Indemnitor with
respect to any Indemnification Claim, objecting to any Indemnification Claim,
disputing the liability of such Indemnitor, or the amount of such liability,
with respect to any Indemnification Claim and prosecuting and resolving such
dispute as herein provided, accepting the defense, compromise and settlement of
any Third Party Claim on behalf of such Indemnitor or refusing to accept the
same, settling and compromising the Losses for such Indemnitor hereunder,
instituting and prosecuting such actions (including arbitration proceedings) as
the Escrow Representative shall deem appropriate in connection with any of the
foregoing, retaining counsel, accountants, appraisers and other advisers in
connection with any of the foregoing, all for the account of the Indemnitor,
such Indemnitor agreeing to be fully bound by the acts, decisions and agreements
of the Escrow Representative taken and done pursuant to the authority herein
granted.

     (b) The Escrow Representative shall assume no responsibility or liability
whatsoever to any person other than to act in good faith on behalf of the
Indemnitors under this Agreement. Each of NEON Systems and Scalable Software
hereby agrees, and each Indemnitor, by such Indemnitor's receipt of any of the
Merger Consideration, will be deemed to have agreed (each of NEON Systems,
Scalable Software and such Indemnitor, a "Representative Indemnifying Party"),
to indemnify the Escrow Representative for and to hold the Escrow Representative
harmless against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred on his part
arising out of or in connection with his acting as the Escrow Representative
pursuant hereto, as well as any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating and defending any such loss, claim, damage or
liability as such expenses are incurred, except to the extent any such loss,
claim, damage or liability is due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Escrow Representative. Each of the Representative Indemnifying Parties
agrees that the Escrow Representative may consult with counsel of his own
choice, and the Escrow Representative shall have full and complete authorization
and protection for any action taken or suffered by the Escrow Representative
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion or advice of such
counsel. Each of the Representative Indemnifying Parties understands and agrees
that the provisions of this Section 13.5(b) provide for indemnification by the
Representative Indemnifying Parties of the Escrow Representative for the
negligence of the Escrow Representative.


                                       40

<PAGE>

     (c) NEON Systems and Scalable Software shall pay all the costs and expenses
incurred by the Representative Indemnifying Parties under Section 13.5(b) and
shall be entitled to reimbursement of one-half of such costs and expenses out
of, but only out of, the Escrow Stock, which shall be the only recourse of NEON
Systems and Scalable Software.

     13.6 Remedies Partially Exclusive. The remedies this Article XIII provide
to NEON Systems and the other Indemnitees shall be their sole and exclusive
remedies against each Indemnitor other than the Principal Stockholders, but
otherwise such remedies will not be exclusive of any rights or remedies
available to any party hereto, either at law or in equity.

     13.7 Arbitration. If a party makes a good faith determination that a breach
(or potential breach) of this Agreement by the other party may result in damages
or consequences that will be immediate, severe, and incapable of adequate
redress after the fact, so that a temporary restraining order or other immediate
injunctive relief is necessary for a realistic and adequate remedy, that party
may seek immediate injunctive relief without first seeking relief through
arbitration. After the court has ruled on the request for injunctive relief, the
parties will thereafter proceed with arbitration of the dispute and stay the
litigation pending arbitration. Subject to the foregoing, any dispute arising
out of this Agreement, or its performance or breach, shall be resolved by
binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of
the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). This arbitration provision is
expressly made pursuant to and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 U.S.C. Sections 1-13. The parties hereto agree that pursuant to Section 9 of
the Federal Arbitration Act, a judgment of the United States District Courts for
the Southern District of Texas shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to
the arbitration. A single arbitrator, who shall have the authority to allocate
the costs of any arbitration initiated under this paragraph, shall be selected
according to the AAA Rules within ten days of the submission to the AAA of the
response to the statement of claim or the date on which any such response is
due, whichever is earlier. The arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration in
accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence. The arbitrator shall decide the
amount and extent of pre-hearing discovery which is appropriate. The arbitrator
shall have the power to enter any award of monetary and/or injunctive relief
(including the power to issue permanent injunctive relief and also the power to
reconsider any prior request for immediate injunctive relief by either of the
parties and any order as to immediate injunctive relief previously granted or
denied by a court in response to a request therefor by either of the parties),
including the power to render an award as provided in Rule 43 of the AAA Rules;
provided, however, that the arbitrator shall not have the power to award
punitive damages under any circumstances (whether styled as punitive, exemplary,
or treble damages, or any penalty or punitive type of damages) regardless of
whether such damages may be available under applicable law, the parties hereby
waiving their rights to recover any such damages. The arbitrator shall award
costs and reasonable attorney's fees as it deems just and equitable. Any
arbitration shall be held in Houston, Texas, for any claim brought by any party
under this Agreement. In addition to the above courts, the arbitration award may
be enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject
matter of the arbitration. With respect to any request for immediate injunctive
relief, the state and federal courts in Houston, Texas, shall have nonexclusive
jurisdiction and venue over any such disputes.

                                  ARTICLE XIV
                         Indemnification by NEON Systems

     14.1 Indemnification by NEON Systems.

     (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Date, NEON Systems shall
indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to individuals
who at any time prior to the Effective Date were directors or officers of
Scalable Software to the same extent such individuals are indemnified or have
the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses set forth in the
Charter Documents of Scalable Software as in effect on the date of this
Agreement in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Date (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
unless such modification is required by law.

     (b) From and after the Effective Date, NEON Systems shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, an officer or director
of Scalable Software (the "Covered Parties") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including any Indemnification Claim or Third Party
Claim and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (each, a "Proceeding") based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person was a director or officer of
Scalable Software ("Indemnified Liabilities"), including all Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the full
extent that NEON Systems is permitted under applicable law to so indemnify;
provided, however, that any rights of the Covered Parties to indemnification
under this Section 14.1 shall not affect their indemnification obligations under
Article XIII. In the event any such Proceeding is brought against any Covered
Party, the indemnifying party shall assume and direct all aspects of the defense
thereof, including settlement, and the Covered Party shall cooperate in the
vigorous defense of any such matter. The Covered Party shall have a right to
participate in (but not control) the defense of any such matter with its own
counsel and at its own expense. Notwithstanding the right of the indemnifying
party to assume and control the defense of such Proceeding, such Covered Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense of such Proceeding, and the indemnifying party shall bear the fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel and shall pay such fees, costs and
expenses promptly after receipt of an invoice from such Covered Party if (i) the
use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent such Covered Party
would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in,
or targets of, any such Proceeding shall have been advised by counsel that there
may be legal defenses available to it or to other Covered Parties which are
different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or
(iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to
such Covered Party, in the exercise of the Covered Party's reasonable judgment,
to represent such Covered Party within a reasonable time after notice of the
institution of such Proceeding. The indemnifying party shall not settle any such
matter unless (i) the Covered Party gives prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably


                                       42

<PAGE>

withheld or delayed, or (ii) the terms of the settlement provide that the
Covered Party shall have no responsibility for the discharge of any settlement
amount and impose no other obligations or duties on the Covered Party and the
settlement discharges all rights against Covered Party with respect to such
matter. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent. Any Covered Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 14.1(b), on learning of any such Proceeding,
shall promptly notify NEON Systems and Scalable Software (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may
have under this Section 14.1(b) except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such indemnifying party), and shall deliver to NEON Systems and
Scalable Software all undertakings required under applicable law. The Covered
Parties as a group will be represented by a single law firm (plus no more than
one local counsel in any jurisdiction) with respect to each such matter unless
there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Covered Parties. The
rights to indemnification under this Section 14.1(b) shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Date; provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Indemnified
Liabilities asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Indemnified Liabilities.

     (c) In the event that NEON Systems or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors or assigns of NEON Systems shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this Section 14.1.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                               General Provisions

Agreement confers upon any person not a party hereto (other than non-signing
stockholders of Scalable Software) any rights or remedies hereunder except as
provided in Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 9.6 and Articles XIII and XIV.

obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange or securities quotation or trading system on which securities of that
