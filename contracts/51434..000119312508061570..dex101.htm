reasonable efforts to properly load the railcars to maximize the total allowable carload weight prescribed by the railroad(s) participating in the movement of Chips to Buyer&#146;s Paper Mill. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for truck delivered
Chips, title to and risk of loss of the Chips shall pass from Seller to Buyer upon the Chips being unloaded at Buyer&#146;s Paper Mill. Title to and risk of loss of any non-conforming chips that are rejected shall revert to the Seller immediately
upon rejection. Buyer may request that Seller deliver Chips to mills other than the Paper Mill (&#147;Other Paper Mills&#148;). Seller will deliver Chips to Other Paper Mills and Buyer agrees to provide supplemental truck transportation, if needed.
