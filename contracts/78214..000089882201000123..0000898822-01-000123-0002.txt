At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving

applicable law; provided, however, that the Articles of Incorporation of the

named "Tosco Corporation".   2.6 By-Laws. The by-laws of Merger Sub as in

ARTICLE III   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   3.1 Exchange Ratio. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any capital stock of Tosco:   (a) All shares of capital stock
of Tosco that are held by Tosco as treasury stock or that are owned by
Phillips immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.  
(b) Subject to Sections 3.1(a) and 3.7, each outstanding share of Tosco
Common Stock (together with any associated Tosco Rights) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive 0.8 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Phillips Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").
All of such shares of Phillips Common Stock shall be duly authorized and
validly issued and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. One preferred share purchase right
issuable pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of August 1, 1999,
between Phillips and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as rights
agent (the "Phillips Rights Agreement"), or any other purchase right issued
in substitution thereof (the "Phillips Rights"), shall be issued together
with and shall attach to each share of Phillips Common Stock issued pursuant
to this Section 3.1(b), unless the Phillips Rights have been redeemed prior
to the    -8-     Effective Time. All shares of Tosco Common Stock
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such shares of Tosco Common Stock (a
"Tosco Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such shares of Tosco Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor and any dividends or
other distributions to which holders of Tosco Common Stock become entitled
all in accordance with this Article III upon the surrender of such Tosco
Certificate.   (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights
issued in respect of, Tosco Common Stock or Phillips Common Stock, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of
Tosco Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.   (d) Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   3.2 Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.
(a) Each option to purchase Tosco Common Stock (a "Tosco Stock Option")
granted under Tosco Stock Plans which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Tosco
Common Stock and shall be converted (as so converted, a "Tosco Converted
Option"), at the Effective Time, into an option to purchase Phillips Common
Stock (a "Phillips Stock Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Tosco Stock Option (but taking into account any changes
thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the Tosco Stock
Plans, in any award agreement or in such option by reason of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Phillips
Common Stock subject to each such Phillips Stock Option shall be the number
of shares of Tosco Common Stock subject to the Tosco Stock Option multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Phillips Common Stock, and such Phillips Stock Option shall have an exercise
price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the
per share exercise price specified in such Tosco Stock Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any Tosco Stock Option
to which Section 421 of the Code as of the Effective Time (after taking into
account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof) applies by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the
number of shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) with respect to each holder of a Tosco Stock Option whose employment with
Tosco is terminated for any reason following the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, Tosco may, in its sole discretion with the consent of such
holder, elect to pay such holder in cancellation of such Tosco Stock Option,
an amount of cash equal to (A) the excess (if any) of (x) the closing price
of Tosco Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported on the NYSE Composite Tape) on
the date of such termination (or if there is no such trading on the date
of termination, on the most recent trading day prior to the date of
termination) over (y) the per-share exercise price of such Tosco Stock Option
times (B) the number of shares    -9-     of Tosco Common Stock
subject to such Tosco Stock Option immediately following such termination,
subject to all required Tax withholding, and (ii) with respect to each holder
of a Tosco Stock Option that is converted into a Phillips Stock Option in
accordance with this Section 3.2 and whose employment with Tosco
is terminated for any reason following the Effective Time and prior to the
date six months after the Closing Date, Phillips may, in its sole discretion
with the consent of such holder, elect to pay such holder in cancellation of
such Phillips Stock Option, an amount of cash equal to (A) the excess (if
any) of (x) the closing price of Phillips Common Stock on the NYSE (as
reported on the NYSE Composite Tape) on the date of such termination (or if
there is no such trading on the date of termination, on the most recent
trading day prior to the date of termination) over (y) the per-share exercise
price of such Phillips Stock Option times (B) the number of shares of
Phillips Common Stock subject to such Phillips Stock Option immediately
following such termination, subject to all required Tax withholding.   (b)
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Phillips shall deliver to
the holders of Tosco Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders\' rights pursuant to the respective Tosco Stock Plans and
agreements evidencing the grants of such Tosco Stock Options and stating that
such Tosco Stock Options and agreements have been assumed by Phillips and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 3.2 after giving effect to the Merger
and the terms of the Tosco Stock Plans).   (c) Prior to the Effective Time,
Tosco shall take all necessary action for the adjustment of Tosco Converted
Options under this Section 3.2. Phillips shall reserve for issuance a number
of shares of Phillips Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of
Phillips Common Stock that will be subject to Tosco Converted Options. As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Phillips shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor, or if Form S-8 is not
available, other appropriate, forms) with respect to the shares of Phillips
Common Stock subject to Tosco Converted Options and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.   3.3 Exchange
Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Phillips shall appoint Mellon Investor
Services LLC, or a commercial bank or trust company, or a subsidiary thereof,
reasonably acceptable to Tosco, to act as exchange agent hereunder for the
purpose of exchanging Tosco Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the
"Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Phillips shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of
Tosco Common Stock, certificates representing the shares of Phillips Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Tosco Common Stock. Following the Effective Time, Phillips agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.5. Any
cash and certificates representing Phillips Common Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent (including the proceeds from sales of Excess Shares in
accordance with Section 3.7) shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."   3.4 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Phillips shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a
Tosco Certificate (a) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Tosco
Certificates    -10-     shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Tosco Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Phillips or Tosco may
reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to Tosco and
Phillips prior to the Effective Time) and (b) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Tosco Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, together with any dividends and other distributions with
respect thereto and any cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of
a Tosco Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Tosco Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (i) shares of Phillips Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
requested by such holder or is otherwise required by applicable law or
regulation) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking
into account all shares of Tosco Common Stock then held by such holder) and
(ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, including cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock pursuant to Section
3.7 and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.5. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section
3.5 or Section 3.7. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Tosco Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Tosco, one or more
shares of Phillips Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper
number of shares of Phillips Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.7 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.5, may be issued with respect to such Tosco
Common Stock to such a transferee if the Tosco Certificate representing such
shares of Tosco Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   3.5
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Tosco Certificate with respect to the
shares of Phillips Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Tosco Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 3.7 until such holder shall surrender such Tosco
Certificate in accordance with Section 3.4. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Tosco Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder thereof without interest, (a) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.7 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Phillips Common Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Phillips Common Stock.   3.6 No Further
Ownership Rights in Tosco Common Stock. All shares of Phillips Common Stock
issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Tosco Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 3.5    -11-     or 3.7) shall be deemed to have
been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Tosco Common Stock.   3.7 No Fractional Shares of Phillips Common
Stock. No certificates or scrip or shares of Phillips Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock or book-entry credit
of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Tosco
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Phillips or a
holder of shares of Phillips Common Stock. In lieu of any such fractional
share, each holder of shares of Tosco Common Stock who would otherwise have
been entitled to a fraction of a share of Phillips Common Stock upon
surrender of Tosco Certificates (determined after taking into account all
Tosco Certificates delivered by such holder) shall be paid upon
such surrender cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
holder\'s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales
in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of
the aggregate fractional Phillips Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Section 3.7. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of
Phillips Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Phillips over (ii)
the aggregate number of full shares of Phillips Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Tosco Common Stock (such excess, the "Excess
Shares"), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Tosco
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the
NYSE. The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed
on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall
be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. All commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with
such sale of Excess Shares shall reduce, but not below zero, the amount of
cash paid to holders in respect of fractional shares. Until the net proceeds
of such sale have been distributed to the former holders of Tosco Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former
holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash
to be paid to such former holders of Tosco Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance
with this Agreement such amounts to such former holders of Tosco Common
Stock.   3.8 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Tosco Certificates one year
after the Effective Time shall, at Phillips\'s request, be delivered to
Phillips or otherwise on the instruction of Phillips, and any holders of
Tosco Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III
shall after such delivery look only to Phillips for the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Tosco Common Stock formerly represented thereby
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.4, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends or distributions with
respect to shares of Phillips Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.5. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Tosco Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the
property of Phillips free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.    -12-      3.9 No Liability. None of
Phillips, Merger Sub, Tosco or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   3.10 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by
Phillips on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to
Tosco stockholders pursuant to the other provisions of this Article III. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be
paid to Phillips.   3.11 Lost Certificates. If any Tosco Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Tosco Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Phillips, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as Phillips may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Tosco Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Tosco Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Tosco Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Phillips Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.   3.12 Withholding Rights. Phillips
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid
over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by Phillips, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Phillips.   3.13 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub or Tosco, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub or Tosco, any other actions and things necessary to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Phillips or the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   3.14 Stock
Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of Tosco shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Tosco Common Stock thereafter on the records of Tosco.
On or after the Effective Time, any Tosco Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent, Phillips or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be
converted into the right to receive the Tosco Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Tosco Common Stock formerly represented thereby
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Phillips Common Stock to
which the holders    -13-     thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.7 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.5).   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES   4.1 Representations and Warranties of Tosco. Except as
disclosed in the Tosco disclosure schedule delivered to Phillips concurrently
herewith (the "Tosco Disclosure Schedule") or in the Tosco SEC Documents,
Tosco hereby represents and warrants to Phillips as follows:   (a)
Corporate Organization. (i) Tosco is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada. Tosco
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of
the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Tosco. True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of Tosco, as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Tosco to
Phillips.   (ii) Each Subsidiary of Tosco (A) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) is
duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Tosco, and (C) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted.   (b) Capitalization. (i) The authorized capital stock of
Tosco consists of (A) 250,000,000 shares of Tosco Common Stock (each of which
includes one Tosco Right), of which, as of January 31, 2001, 144,896,342
shares were issued and outstanding and 32,927,172 shares were held in
treasury and (B) 12,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Tosco ("Tosco Preferred Stock," together with the Tosco Common
Stock, the "Tosco Capital Stock"), of which no shares are issued and
outstanding. From January 31, 2001 to the date of this Agreement, no shares
of Tosco Capital Stock have been issued except pursuant to employee and
director stock plans of Tosco in effect as of the date hereof (the "Tosco
Stock Plans"). As of the date of this Agreement, except pursuant to the terms
of options, stock and restricted units issued pursuant to Tosco Stock Plans,
pursuant to the 5 3/4% convertible junior subordinated debentures of Tosco
and the 5 3/4% convertible preferred securities of Tosco Financing Trust
(together, the "Tosco Toprs") and pursuant to the Tosco Rights, Tosco does
not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of Tosco Capital Stock or any other equity
securities of Tosco or any securities of Tosco representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Tosco Capital Stock. As of
January 31, 2001, no    -14-     shares of Tosco Capital Stock were
reserved for issuance, except for 9,010,474 shares of Tosco Common Stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the
Tosco Stock Plans and in respect of the employee and director savings,
compensation and deferred compensation plans described in the Tosco 1999
10-K, 9,113,940 shares of Tosco Common Stock reserved for issuance upon
conversion of the Tosco Toprs and 2,500,000 shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock reserved for issuance in connection with
the Tosco Rights Agreement. Tosco has no Voting Debt issued or
outstanding.   (ii) Except for immaterial amounts of directors\'
qualifying shares in foreign Subsidiaries of Tosco, Tosco owns, directly or
indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity ownership interests of each Subsidiary of Tosco, free and clear
of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security interests
whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests
are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of Tosco has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock
or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. Section 4.2(b)(ii) of
the Tosco Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each material investment
of Tosco in any corporation, joint venture, partnership, limited liability
company or other entity other than its Subsidiaries, which would
be considered a Significant Subsidiary if such investment constituted control
of such entity (each a "Non-Subsidiary Affiliate").   (c) Authority; No
Violation. (i) Tosco has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly approved by
the Board of Directors of Tosco. The Board of Directors of Tosco has directed

meeting of Tosco stockholders for the purpose of approving the Merger and

the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Tosco Common Stock
(the "Tosco Stockholder Approval"), no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Tosco are necessary to approve this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Tosco and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Phillips and Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Tosco, enforceable against Tosco in accordance with its
terms.   (ii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Tosco, nor the consummation by Tosco of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Tosco with any of the terms or provisions hereof,

Incorporation or By-Laws of Tosco, or (B) assuming that the consents and
approvals referred to in Section 4.1(d) are duly obtained, (x) violate any

instrument or obligation to which Tosco, any of its Subsidiaries or Non-
Subsidiary Affiliates is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the case of clause

audit adjustments in the case of unaudited statements.   (f) Absence of
Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the unaudited financial
statements (or notes thereto) included in the Tosco 10-Q, neither Tosco nor
any of its Subsidiaries had at September 30, 2000, or has incurred since that

proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Tosco,
threatened, against or affecting Tosco or any of its   
-17-     Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Tosco, any basis for any
such suit, action, proceeding or investigation that could, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on

Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Tosco or its
Subsidiaries having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, any such

rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity relating to Tosco or any of its

Adverse Effect on Tosco.   (j) Contracts. (i) Neither Tosco nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding (whether written or oral) (A) with respect to the employment
of any directors, officers or employees other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (B) which, upon the consummation or
stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from
Phillips, Tosco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (C) which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been
filed or incorporated by reference in the Tosco SEC Documents, or (D) which
materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by Tosco or upon
consummation of the Merger will materially restrict the ability of Phillips
or the Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of business.
Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described
in this Section 4.1(j), whether or not set forth in the Tosco Disclosure
Schedule or in the Tosco SEC Documents, is referred to herein as a "Tosco
Contract" (for purposes of clarification, each "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be
performed after the date of this Agreement, whether or not filed with the

to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate

required to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third
party, except to the extent that any failure to pay such Taxes would not

Phillips. Neither Phillips nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns in respect of any
taxable year which have not since been filed, nor made any request for
waivers of the time to assess any Taxes that are pending or outstanding,
except where such request or waiver would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Phillips. The consolidated federal income Tax
Returns of Phillips have been examined, or the statute of limitations has
closed, with respect to all taxable years through and including 1995. Neither
Phillips nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any
Person (other than Phillips and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign
law), except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Phillips. Neither Phillips nor any Subsidiary of Phillips is a
party to any agreement (with any Person other than Phillips and/or any of its
Subsidiaries) relating to the allocation or sharing of Taxes, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Phillips.  
(q) Reorganization under the Code. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Phillips nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any
fact that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (r)
Form S-4; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. None of the information to be
supplied by Phillips or its Subsidiaries in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the time of the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the
time of each of the Phillips Stockholders Meeting and the Tosco Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply, as of
its mailing date, as to form in all material respects with all
applicable laws, including the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation is made
by Phillips or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by Tosco for
inclusion therein.   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF

transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any regulatory
law, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction
or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Entity which would make the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair
or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Tosco and Phillips shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts,
including, subject to Section 6.4(a), selling, holding

specified manner, to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger

statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit a party\'s right to terminate this

state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other

practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize
the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.   6.5 Acquisition Proposals.

Person) beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of its total
voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or the
voting power of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer
or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by any other party to
this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have any discussion with or provide any
confidential information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition

an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to

-37-      (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
each of Phillips and Tosco (and their respective Boards of Directors) shall
be permitted to (A) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (to the extent
applicable), (B) effect a Change in the Phillips Recommendation or a Change
in the Tosco Recommendation, as the case may be, or (C) engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such Person,
if and only to the extent that, in any such case referred to in clause (B) or
(C), (I) in the case of Phillips, the Phillips Stockholders Meeting shall not
have occurred, or in the case of Tosco, the Tosco Stockholders Meeting shall
not have occurred, (II) (x) in the case of clause (B) above, it has received
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party and
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) in the case of clause (C) above, its
Board of Directors concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal could constitute a Superior
Proposal, (III) in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, its Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith
that there is a reasonable probability that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (IV)
prior to providing any information or data to any Person in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, its Board of Directors receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that
are customary in such agreements, as advised by counsel, provided that if
such confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive
than the comparable provision, or omits restrictive provisions, contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, then the Confidentiality Agreement will be
deemed to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provisions or to
omit such restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and (V) prior
to providing any information or data to any Person or entering into
discussions or negotiations with any Person, it notifies the other party
promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers. Each of Phillips and
Tosco agrees that it will promptly keep each other reasonably informed of the
status and terms of any inquiries, proposals or offers and the status and
terms of any discussions or negotiations, including the identity of the party
making such inquiry, proposal or offer. Each of Phillips and Tosco agrees
that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
(other than the parties to this Agreement) conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of Phillips and Tosco agrees that it will
use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its directors, officers, key
employees, agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 6.5. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (x) permit Phillips or Tosco
to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article VIII
hereof) or (y) affect or limit any other obligation of Phillips or Tosco
under this Agreement.   6.6 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 8.2,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such Expenses, except Expenses incurred in connection
with the filing, printing and mailing of the Joint Proxy   
-38-     Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4, which shall be shared equally
by Phillips and Tosco. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in
preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns.   6.7 Directors\' and
Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance. Following the Effective Time,
Phillips shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of Tosco
and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (A) to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of
the date of this Agreement by Tosco pursuant to Tosco\'s Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation, By-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date hereof with, or for the benefit of, any directors,
officers and employees of Tosco and its Subsidiaries and (B)
without limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent permitted by law, in
each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
(ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporation\'s (or any successor\'s) articles of incorporation and by-laws
for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions contained in the current Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws of Tosco and (iii) cause to be maintained for a
period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by Tosco (provided that Phillips (or any
successor) may substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall Phillips be required to expend in
any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently
paid by Tosco for such insurance; and, provided further that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Phillips shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. The obligations of Phillips under this Section 6.7 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this Section 6.7 applies without the consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 6.7 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.7).   6.8 Employee Benefits. (a) Phillips agrees that, from and
after the Effective Time, Phillips and its Subsidiaries shall assume and
honor all Tosco Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms. For a period of not
less than one year following the Effective Time, Phillips shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to individuals who are employees of the Tosco and
its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time and who continue to be
employed by Phillips and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the
"Tosco Employees") compensation and employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to Tosco Employees
immediately before the Effective Time, as disclosed by Tosco to Phillips
before the date of this Agreement. The foregoing shall not be construed to
prevent the termination of employment of any Tosco Employee or the amendment
or termination of any particular Tosco Benefit Plan to the extent permitted
by its terms as in    -39-     effect immediately before the Effective
Time; provided, however, that at the option of an affected Tosco Employee (up
to a total of fifteen Tosco Employees), any split dollar life insurance
policies shall be continued.   (b) For all purposes under the employee
benefit plans of Phillips and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Tosco Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Tosco
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Tosco and
its Subsidiaries and predecessor employers before the Effective Time, to the
same extent as such Tosco Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Tosco Benefit Plans, except to
the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Tosco Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a Tosco Benefit Plan in which such
Tosco Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Tosco
Employee, Phillips shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Phillips shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.   6.9 Public
Announcements. Phillips and Tosco shall use reasonable best efforts to
develop a joint communications plan and each shall use reasonable best
efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with
such joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent
disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1, neither Phillips nor Tosco
shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
disclosure concerning the other party or the other party\'s business,
financial condition or results of operations without the consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   6.10
Listing of Shares of Phillips Common Stock. Phillips shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Phillips Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and the shares of Phillips Common Stock to be reserved for issuance

NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) The Board of Directors of Tosco shall take all action to
the extent necessary (including amending the Tosco Rights Agreement) in order

foregoing sentence, the Board of Directors of Tosco shall not, without the
prior written consent of Phillips, (i) amend the Tosco Rights Agreement or
(ii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the
Tosco Rights Agreement, including a redemption of the Tosco Rights, in each
case in order to facilitate any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Tosco.   6.12 Affiliates. Not less than 45 days prior to the date of

identifying all persons who, in the judgment of Tosco, may be deemed at the
time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of Tosco,
"affiliates" of Tosco for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and
applicable SEC rules and regulations, and such list shall be updated as
necessary to reflect changes from the date thereof. Tosco shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each person identified on such list to
deliver to Phillips not later than ten days prior to the Effective Time, a
written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (an
"Affiliate Agreement").   6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective
Time, Phillips and Tosco shall take all such steps as may be required to

(including derivative securities with respect to Phillips Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article II or Article III of
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Tosco or

Indebtedness issued under indentures qualified under the Trust Indenture Act

Assumed Indentures, supplemental indentures or other instruments, in form
satisfactory to the respective trustees or other representatives, expressly

best efforts to cause to be delivered to Phillips a letter from its

of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the

both parties need not sign the same counterpart.   9.5 Entire Agreement; No
Third Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto and the other agreements and
instruments of the parties delivered in connection herewith constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.   (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or

governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).   9.7
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  
9.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any
such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   9.9 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each of Phillips and
Tosco irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
hereof brought by the other party hereto    -49-     or its
successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the Chancery or other
Courts of the State of Delaware, and each of Phillips and Tosco
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of Phillips and Tosco
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a

jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
