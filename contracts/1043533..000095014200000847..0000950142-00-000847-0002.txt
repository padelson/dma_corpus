vii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  ----------------------------  
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 9, 2000 (this "AGREEMENT"),
by and among, Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"PARENT"), SiteSmith, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and
Aqueduct Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Parent ("MERGER SUB").    RECITALS   (a) The respective
boards of directors of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have determined
that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders to combine the respective businesses of the Parent and the
Company, and consequently have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "MERGER"), and have approved and adopted this Agreement
and the Merger, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL").   (b) Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, as a condition to the willingness of the Parent to enter into
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (the "PRINCIPAL
STOCKHOLDERS") are entering into a Voting Agreement, a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"), providing for, among
other things, the approval and adoption by such stockholders of this
Agreement and the Merger.   (c) Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, as a condition to the willingness of the Parent to enter into
this Agreement, Mark Spagnolo and Robert J. Ryan, IV are each entering
into Employment Agreements, dated as of the date hereof and effective as of
the Effective Time, with the Company, copies of which are attached hereto as
Exhibit B-1 (the "SPAGNOLO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT") and as Exhibit B-2 (the
"RYAN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT"), respectively.   (d) It is intended that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and the rules and regulations
promulgated under the Code and that this Agreement be, and is hereby, adopted
as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the Code.   (e)
Certain terms used in this Agreement which are not capitalized have the
meanings specified in Section 9.1.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
mutual representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be
legally bound by this Agreement, agree as follows:      ARTICLE I  
THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time and in
accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with this Agreement and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL, including Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.2
CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place: (a) at
the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, New York, New York

fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement; or (b) at such other place and
time and/or on such other date as the Parent and the Company may agree in
writing (the "CLOSING DATE").   SECTION 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. As soon as
practicable following the Closing, the parties hereto will cause a
Certificate of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") to be signed,
acknowledged and delivered for filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective at the time when a Certificate of Merger has been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such other subsequent
date or time as shall be agreed upon by the parties and set forth in the
Certificate of Merger and in accordance with the DGCL (the "EFFECTIVE
TIME").   SECTION 1.4 THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety
as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub then reads and shall, as so
amended, from and after the Effective Time, be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended as provided
therein or by applicable law.   2     SECTION 1.5 THE BY-LAWS. The by-
laws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be amended at the Effective Time to read in their entirety as the by-laws of
Merger Sub then read and shall, as so amended, from and after the Effective
Time, be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended as
provided therein or by applicable law.   SECTION 1.6 DIRECTORS OF SURVIVING
CORPORATION. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.  
SECTION 1.7 OFFICERS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. The officers of the Company at
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.    ARTICLE II   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON
CAPITAL STOCK;  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION 2.1 CONVERSION OF
CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company:   (a)
MERGER CONSIDERATION.   (i) Each share of the common stock, par value
$.0001 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Parent Subsidiary or by the Company) shall be converted, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into the
right to receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $
.01 per share, of the Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK") equal to the "EXCHANGE
RATIO," which shall be calculated as follows:   (x) if the Average Parent
Stock  Price is greater than or equal to $24.00 and less than or  equal to
$27.2727, then the "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to  the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the Aggregate Share  Consideration by (B) the Total Company
Shares;   3     (y) if the Average Parent Stock  Price is less than
$24.00, then the "Exchange Ratio" shall be  equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) 62,500,000 by  (B) the Total Company Shares; and   (z) if the
Average Parent Stock  Price is greater than $27.2727, then the "Exchange
Ratio"  shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A)  55,000,000
by (B) the Total Company Shares.   The "AGGREGATE SHARE CONSIDERATION" means
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole
number) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $1,500,000,000 by the
Average Parent Stock Price.   The "AVERAGE PARENT STOCK PRICE" means the
average of the daily closing prices of the Parent Common Stock as quoted by
The Nasdaq Stock Market\'s National Market System ("NASDAQ/NMS") (as reported
by BLOOMBERG, L.P.) for the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the
fourth business day (including such fourth business day in the determination)
immediately prior to the Closing.   "TOTAL COMPANY SHARES" means the sum of
(i) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the business day
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of all Company
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Common
Stock (including all Company Warrants, Company Stock Options and Company
Preferred Stock) outstanding on the business day immediately prior to the
Closing Date.   (ii) Each share of the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Company (the "COMPANY SERIES A
PREFERRED STOCK"), the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$.0001 per share, of the Company (the "COMPANY SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK"),
and the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.0001 per share, of
the Company (the "COMPANY SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK," and, together with the
Company Series A Preferred Stock and the Company Series B Preferred Stock,
the "COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Preferred Stock that are
owned by the Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, Merger Sub, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) shall be converted, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that each such share of Company Preferred Stock would
have been entitled to receive upon conversion pursuant to Article IV(B)(4) of
the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
(the "COMPANY CERTIFICATE") immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) the
Exchange Ratio.   (iii) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) and (ii) shall be subject
to adjustment as provided   4    in Section 2.6 and such shares,
together with cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(f), shall collectively be referred to as the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION." At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding, shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(a "CERTIFICATE") formerly representing such shares shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
distribution or dividend under Section 2.2(c).   (b) CAPITAL STOCK OF
MERGER SUB. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger
Sub ("SUB COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.   (c) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-
OWNED STOCK. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company
as treasury stock or by the Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
such shares, no longer be outstanding, (ii) shall be canceled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor, and (iii) shall cease to
exist.   SECTION 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT.
Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.3 and 2.5, as of the Effective Time,
the Parent shall deposit with the Parent\'s transfer agent for its shares of
Parent Common Stock, or with such other bank or trust company designated by
the Parent prior to the Effective Time and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) after giving effect to Sections 2.3
and 2.5 (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto to which the holders of Certificates
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and with the proceeds held in the
Exchange Trust, being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates) to the Exchange Agent, in a form
and with other customary provisions specified by the Parent, (ii)
instructions for surrendering the Certificates in exchange for (A)
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, (B) cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and (C) any unpaid dividends and other distributions and
(iii) the stock transfer powers required by the Escrow Agent  
5    pursuant to Section 2.3. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of that Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange (1) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive under this Article II
(after giving effect to the provisions of Section 2.3), (2) a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholding) of (x) any cash
in lieu of fractional shares plus (y) any unpaid dividends (other than stock
dividends) and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder
has the right to receive under the provisions of this Article II. Any
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon the
surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in
respect of those shares, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent and accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect the transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any certificate
for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that
in which the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of such exchange that the person requesting such exchange pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for shares of
Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Parent or the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH
RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by the Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock and
the record date for that dividend or other distribution is after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under
this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until that Certificate is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this
Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of issuance of such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock and not previously paid, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.  
6     (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. All shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
cash paid under Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(f) issued upon the surrender
for or exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.   (e) NO FURTHER
TRANSFERS. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (f) FRACTIONAL SHARES.   (i) No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share
interest will not entitle its owner to vote, to receive dividends or other
distributions or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive from the Exchange Agent, in
accordance with the provisions of this Article II, a cash payment in lieu of
such fractional share of Parent Common Stock, representing such holder\'s
proportionate interest, if any, in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be
made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange
Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such
holders of the aggregate of the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, as
applicable, which would otherwise have been issued (the "EXCESS PARENT
SHARES"). Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed
to the holders of Certificates, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in
trust (the "EXCHANGE TRUST") for the holders of Certificates. All
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in
connection with this sale of the Excess Parent Shares shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of Certificates without interest. The
Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by
a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder is entitled (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock then held by
such   7    holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount
of fractional share interests to which all holders of Certificates are
entitled.   (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this
Section 2.2(f), the Parent may elect, at its option exercised prior to the
Effective Time and in lieu of the issuance and sale of Excess Parent Shares
and the making of the payments contemplated in such subsection, to pay to the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) by (B) the closing price for a share of Parent
Common Stock on the first business day immediately following the Effective
Time as quoted by NASDAQ/NMS (as reported by BLOOMBERG, L.P.) and, in such
case, all references in this Agreement to the cash proceeds of the sale of
the Excess Shares and similar references shall be deemed to mean and refer to
the payments calculated as set forth in this Section 2.2(f)(ii).   (g)
TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND; UNCLAIMED STOCK. Any shares of Parent Common
Stock and any portion of the Exchange Fund or of dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock deposited by the Parent
with the Exchange Agent (including the proceeds of any investments of those
funds) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Parent. Any former
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of their
Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions issuable or
payable pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2(c) upon due surrender of
their Certificates, in each case, without any interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any amount properly delivered to
a public official under applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to five years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts
payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled to those
amounts.   (h) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of a bond in the
form customarily required by the Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
shares of Parent Common Stock, any unpaid dividends or other distributions
and any   8    cash payment in lieu of a fractional share in respect of
that Certificate issuable or payable under this Article II upon due surrender
thereof and deliverable in respect of the shares represented by such
Certificate under this Agreement, in each case, without interest.   SECTION
2.3 ESCROW.   (a) At the Closing, the Parent shall withhold from the shares
of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be issued in the Merger to each
holder of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (the
"COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS") pursuant to Section 2.1(a), a number of such shares
of Parent Common Stock that is equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger
Consideration, and the number of such shares of Parent Common Stock withheld
from each Company Stockholder shall be PRO RATA and shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number of such shares (such withheld shares of Parent
Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the "ESCROW SHARES"). The
Parent will deliver certificates representing such Escrow Shares to an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company, as escrow agent (the
"ESCROW AGENT"), and, at the time prescribed in Section 2.2(b), the Company
Stockholders will deliver to the Escrow Agent related stock transfer powers
executed by the applicable Company Stockholders (with medallion signature
guarantees if requested by the Escrow Agent), to be held by the Escrow Agent
as security for the Company Stockholders\' indemnification obligations under
Article VIII and pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT")
to be entered into at the Closing by the Parent, the Escrow Agent and Mark
Spagnolo, as the representative of the Company Stockholders (the "ESCROW
REPRESENTATIVE") under the Escrow Agreement and as the attorney-in-fact and
agent for and on behalf of each Company Stockholder as provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Shares shall be withheld from each Company Stockholder
PRO RATA in the same proportion as the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to such stockholder under Section 2.1(a) bears to the
total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued to all
Company Stockholders under Section 2.1(a). The Escrow Shares shall be
represented by stock certificates issued in the names of each of the Company
Stockholders in proportion to their respective interests in the Escrow Shares
and shall be held by the Escrow Agent during that time period commencing on
the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time
or on such earlier or later date as may be provided in the Escrow Agreement
(such time period being hereafter called the "ESCROW PERIOD").   (b) By
their approval of the Merger, the Company Stockholders will be conclusively
deemed to have consented to, approved and agreed to be bound by: (i) the
indemnification provisions of Article VIII; (ii) the Escrow Agreement; (iii)
the appointment of Mark Spagnolo as the Escrow Representative; and (iv) the
taking by the Escrow Representative of any and all actions and the making of
any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Escrow Representative
under this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of
the power to: (I) authorize delivery to the Parent of Escrow Shares in
satisfaction of indemnity claims by the Parent or any other Indemnified
Person pursuant to Article VIII and/or the Escrow   9    Agreement; (II)
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand
arbitration of, and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to, such claims; (III) arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise
any claim for indemnity made pursuant to Article VIII; and (IV) take all
actions necessary in the judgment of the Escrow Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Escrow Representative will have
authority and power to act on behalf of each Company Stockholder with respect
to the Escrow Agreement and the disposition, settlement or other handling of
all claims under Article VIII hereof or governed by the Escrow Agreement, and
all rights or obligations arising under the Escrow Agreement so long as all
Company Stockholders are treated in the same manner. The Company Stockholders
will be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the Escrow
Representative in connection with the Escrow Agreement, and the Parent will
be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Escrow Representative.
In performing the functions specified in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Representative will not be liable to any Company
Stockholder in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the Escrow Representative. Any loss, liability or expense reasonably
incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Escrow
Representative in connection with actions taken by the Escrow Representative
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal
counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs) will be paid by the
Company Stockholders to the Escrow Representative PRO RATA in proportion to
their respective percentage interests in the Escrow Shares. In performing the
functions specified in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Representative shall have reasonable access to information about the Parent
and the reasonable assistance of the Parent\'s officers and employees;
PROVIDED, that the Escrow Representative shall treat confidentiality and not
disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary to any person (except on a need to know basis to individuals who
agree to treat such information confidentially).   SECTION 2.4 TREATMENT OF
COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND COMPANY WARRANTS.   (a) The Parent and the
Company shall take such actions as are necessary to provide that, at the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option and Company Warrant
shall be assumed by the Parent and adjusted in accordance with the terms
thereof and this Agreement to be exercisable to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock, as provided below. Following the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Option and Company Warrant shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Option Plans or
any other agreement pursuant to which such Company Stock Option or Company
Warrant was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time, as the case may
be, except that (i) each such Company Stock Option and Company Warrant, as
the case may be, shall be exercisable for that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant,
as the case may be, was exercisable, and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded, in
the case of any Company Stock Options, other than an "incentive stock option"
(within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code), or Company Warrant, up,
and,   10    in the case of any Company Stock Option that is an
incentive stock option, down, to the nearest whole share, and (ii) the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant
shall be equal to the aggregate exercise prices of such Company Stock Option
or Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option
or Company Warrant shall be exercisable as determined in accordance with the
preceding clause (i), rounded to the nearest cent in the case of any Company
Warrant or any Company Stock Option other than an "incentive stock option"
and, in the case of any Company Stock Option that is an "incentive stock
option," rounded up to the nearest cent.   (b) As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, the Parent shall deliver to the holders of
Company Stock Options and Company Warrants appropriate notices setting forth
such holders\' rights after giving effect to the Merger and the provisions
set forth above. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make
such amendments and take such other actions, if any, to the Company Option
Plans or such other agreement pursuant to which the Company Stock Options or
Company Warrants were issued as shall be necessary to permit the assumption
and adjustment referred to in this Section 2.4 and except as expressly
required by the terms thereof as in effect on the date hereof and described
in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, to ensure that none of the
Company Stock Options or Company Warrants shall vest, and that there shall
not be any acceleration of vesting schedules under the terms of such Company
Stock Options and Company Warrants, as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (c) It is the intention of the parties that, to
the extent that any Company Stock Option constituted an incentive stock
option immediately prior to the Effective Time, such option continue to
qualify as an incentive stock option to the maximum extent permitted by
Section 422 of the Code, and that the assumption of the Company Stock Options
provided by this Section 2.4 satisfy the conditions of Section 424(a) of the
Code. The Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company Option Plans and
ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, such
Company Option Plans, that the Company Stock Options that qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as
incentive stock options after the Effective Time.   (d) The Parent shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company
Stock Options and Company Warrants at and after the Effective Time.  
SECTION 2.5 APPRAISAL RIGHTS. (a) On the date hereof, the Company shall send
to its stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights the notice required
by Section 262 of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of the California General Corporate
Law ("CGCL"), if applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company for
which, as of the date which is   11    20 days after the mailing of the
notice to stockholders required by Section 262 of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of
the CGCL, if applicable, the holder thereof has demanded an appraisal of
their value in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the
CGCL, if applicable ("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.1(a), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the
DGCL and Chapter 13 of the CGCL, if applicable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
the status of any such shares as Dissenting Shares shall not be perfected in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of the CGCL, if
applicable, or if any such shares shall lose their status as
Dissenting Shares, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
(upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
shares) Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(a).   (b) The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand received by
the Company to require the Company to purchase Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of the CGCL, if applicable, and of any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL or CGCL, if applicable, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand unless the Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment
or settlement offer.   SECTION 2.6 ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION. In the
event that prior to the Effective Time there is a change in the number of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a distribution,
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio
shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of that event.  
SECTION 2.7 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and the
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provisions of Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the
case may be, and paid to the appropriate taxing authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of a Certificate in respect to which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the
case may be.   12      ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and
Merger Sub that:   SECTION 3.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION;

governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not resulted and could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes of this Agreement,
"MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY" means any change in or effect on the
business, assets, properties, results of operations or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is or could
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that could reasonably be expected
to materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, other than any change or effect relating to, arising out
of or resulting from (i) general changes relating to the internet
infrastructure or telecommunications industry, (ii) general changes in United
States economic conditions, (iii) general changes in the United
States securities markets, or (iv) the announcement of the execution of this

contemplated hereby.   (b) Section 3.1(b) of the disclosure

the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or to effect the
registration of any shares of Company Common Stock or other Company
securities under the Securities Act. Each outstanding share of capital stock
of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights and each such share owned
by the Company or a Company Subsidiary is free and clear of all security
interests, liens (other than statutory liens), claims, pledges, options,
rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company\'s or such
other Company Subsidiary\'s voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of
any nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS"). Except as set forth in Section

3.6 REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the

consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for the Company or any Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate

PLANS.   (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter: (i) each pension, retirement, savings,
disability, medical, dental, health, life, death benefit, group insurance,
profit sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, bonus, incentive,
severance pay, or other employee benefit plan, trust, arrangement, contract,
commitment, agreement or policy (collectively, "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS") of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been administered and is in
material compliance with the terms of such plan and all applicable laws,
rules and regulations in all material respects; (ii) no "reportable event"
(as such term is used in Section 4043 of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (other than those events for
which the 30 day notice has been waived pursuant to the regulations), non-
exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is used in Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) or "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such
term is used in Section 412 or 4971 of the Code) has heretofore occurred with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan or any Benefit Plan of its affiliates and
any trade or business which is or within the past five years has been under
common control or which is or within the past five years has been treated as
a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code ("ERISA AFFILIATE"); and (iii) with respect to the Company Benefit
Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, the Company has
received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") setting forth the
determination that such Company Benefit Plans are so qualified and the trusts
maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income taxation
under Section 501 of the Code, the Company may rely on an opinion letter
issued with respect to a standardized prototype plan adopted in accordance
with the requirements for such reliance, or the Company has applied (or there
is time remaining to apply) to the IRS for such determination letter and to
make amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination with respect to
all periods since the date of adoption of such Company Benefit Plan, and
that nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Company
Benefit Plans which could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption
or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code
which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and no notice has been received from the IRS with respect to
the revocation of such qualification.   (b) There is no litigation or
administrative or other proceeding involving any Company Benefit Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits and administrative appeals with respect to
such claims) nor has the Company or any Company Subsidiary received notice
that any such proceeding is threatened, in each case where an adverse
determination, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has
not incurred, nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, is reasonably likely to incur
any withdrawal liability with respect to any "multiemployer plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The termination of, or withdrawal from, any Company Benefit Plan
or multiemployer plan to   20    which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary contributes, on or prior to the Closing Date, will not subject the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any liability under Title IV of ERISA
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (c) Section
3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all material Company Benefit
Plans. Correct and complete copies of the following documents, with respect

of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company Benefit Plans provide
for post-employment life or health insurance, benefits or coverage for
any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except as may be
required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended ("COBRA") and at the expense of the participant or the participant\'s
beneficiary. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and except as individually or in the aggregate do not have or could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,

Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder.  
(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment becoming
due to any employee (current, former or retired) of the Company, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan or
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits under any such plan.   (f) Except as set forth in Section
3.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible

nor any Company Subsidiary has made any payment that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) of the Code.   21     SECTION
3.11 TAX MATTERS. Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor is the
Company aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that would
prevent the Merger from constituting a transaction qualifying as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   SECTION 3.12
CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS. Except for the Contracts disclosed in Section
3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, correct and complete copies of which
have been made available to the Parent, there is no Contract that is material

CONTRACT"). Each of the Material Contracts constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of the Company or such Company Subsidiary and of the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is in full
force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor to the
Company\'s knowledge, any other person, is in material violation of or
in material default under (nor does there exist any condition which with
the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation of
or default under) any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary

obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors\' rights

Company Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning
of the National Labor Relations Act or applicable state statutes) or seeking
to compel the Company or any Company Subsidiary to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages and conditions of employment, in any such case, that

activity involving any employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary

of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite

conducted. Each of the Parent, Merger Sub and each Parent Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in

could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
PARENT" means any change in or effect on the business, assets, properties,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Parent or
any Parent Subsidiaries that is or could reasonably be expected to be

Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by hereby, other
than any change or effect relating to, arising out of or resulting from (i)
general changes relating to the internet infrastructure or telecommunications
industry or (ii) general changes in United States economic conditions, (iii)
general changes in the United States securities markets or (iv) the

of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.2 CERTIFICATE

those documents. The Parent Charter Documents, the Merger Sub Charter
Documents and all comparable organizational documents of the other Parent
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect. Neither the Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of its organized

LETTER"), executed by each such person so identified as an "affiliate" of the
Company.   43     SECTION 5.7 DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INDEMNIFICATION
AND INSURANCE.   (a) The Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification
now existing in favor of any employee, agent, director or officer of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as provided
in their respective charters or by-laws, in an agreement between
an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries,
or otherwise in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be maintained by
the Surviving Corporation and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the
Effective Time; PROVIDED that in the event any claim or claims are asserted
or made within such six- year period, all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of
any and all such claims. The Parent also agrees to indemnify all Indemnified
Parties with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such
individuals\' services as officers, directors, employees or agents of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or as trustees or fiduciaries of
any plan for the benefit of employees, or otherwise on behalf of, the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved
in any capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with
any matter, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
occurring prior to, and including, the Effective Time, the Parent will pay as
incurred such Indemnified Party\'s legal and other expenses (including the
cost of any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each

successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.7.   SECTION 5.8 WRITTEN CONSENT OR STOCKHOLDERS
MEETING. The Company shall prepare and deliver to each Principal Stockholder
a written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders (the "WRITTEN
CONSENT"), or, if for any reason the Company cannot obtain or make use of the
Written Consent after using its reasonable best efforts, the Company shall
call and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the "COMPANY
STOCKHOLDERS MEETING"), in either case as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement Effective Date, for the purpose of consenting to or
voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts (through its agents or otherwise) to solicit
from its stockholders consents or proxies in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement, and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure Requisite Company Vote.   SECTION 5.9 REASONABLE BEST
EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and
to applicable legal requirements, each of the   44    parties to this
Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, in the case of the
Company, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement
in doing, as promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to ensure that the
conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, including the execution of additional
instruments, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall take all such necessary action.   SECTION 5.10 REGISTRATION
STATEMENT. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Parent shall finish the preparation of and, with the cooperation and
assistance of the Company, file with the SEC, a Registration Statement in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
Merger. The Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have or cause
the Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable,
and shall take any action required under any applicable federal or state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger. The Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company as the Parent may reasonably request in connection
with such actions and the preparation of the Registration Statement.  
SECTION 5.11 CONSENTS; FILINGS; FURTHER ACTION.   (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties to this
Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain from Governmental Entities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
required to be obtained or made by the Parent or the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other submissions either required or deemed
appropriate by each of the parties, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement required
under (A) the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable
federal or Blue Sky Laws, (B) the HSR Act, (C) the DGCL, (D) the CGCL, if
applicable, (E) any other applicable Law and (F) the rules and regulations of
NASDAQ/NMS. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate and consult with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including by
providing copies of all such documents to the nonfiling party and its
advisors prior to filing, and none of the parties will file any such document
if any of the other parties shall have reasonably objected to the filing of
such document. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions  
45    contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Entity without the consent and agreement of the other parties to this
Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.11(a), each party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the others of any material communication from
the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other domestic
or foreign government or governmental or multinational authority regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party or any affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such government or authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith
to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. The Parent will advise the Company promptly in respect of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the Parent
proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other domestic or foreign government or
governmental or multinational authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulatory laws, rules or regulations of any domestic or foreign government
or governmental authority or any multinational authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11 shall require, or be construed to
require, the Parent or the Company, in connection with the receipt of any
regulatory approval, to proffer to, or agree to (i) sell or hold separate and
agree to sell, divest or to discontinue or limit, before or after
the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or
businesses of the Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates
(or to the consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, or discontinuance or
limitation by the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, of any of its
assets or businesses) or (ii) agree to any conditions relating to, or changes
or restrictions in, the operations of any such asset or businesses which, in
either case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Parent or a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to
materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to such
party of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 5.12
PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax
regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party to this Agreement shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not,
without the prior written consent of the parties to this Agreement, knowingly
take any actions or cause any actions to be taken which could prevent the
Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, and consistent with any
such consent, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any of their
affiliates shall knowingly take any action or knowingly cause any action to
be taken   46    which would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parent shall execute and
deliver to each of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, counsel to the
Parent, and Venture Law Group, a Professional Corporation, counsel to the
Company, a tax representation letter substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E-1 (the "PARENT TAX REPRESENTATION LETTER"), and the
Company shall execute and deliver to each of those law firms a tax
representation letter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E-2 (the "COMPANY TAX REPRESENTATION LETTER"), in connection with the
delivery by those law firms of the tax opinions referred to in
Sections 6.2(h) and 6.3(c).   SECTION 5.13 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The
initial press release concerning the Merger shall be a joint press release
and, thereafter, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent
required by applicable Law or the requirements of NASDAQ/NMS, in which case
the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other parties before issuing any such release or making any such public
statement.   SECTION 5.14 OBLIGATIONS OF MERGER SUB. The Parent shall
take all actions necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   SECTION 5.15 NASDAQ/NMS
LISTINGS. The Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NASDAQ/NMS, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
the Effective Time.   SECTION 5.16 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.5(b), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expense, except that Expenses incurred in connection with the
filing fee for the Merger under the HSR Act shall be shared equally by the
Parent and the Company.   SECTION 5.17 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any Takeover
Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Company and its
respective board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.   47     SECTION 5.18 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
AND STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, the
Parent shall, except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all
benefits and obligations under the Benefit Plans, each as in effect on the
date of this Agreement (or as amended as contemplated hereby or with the
prior written consent of the Parent). The Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue in effect any Company Benefit Plan under which any
former employee of the Company is receiving COBRA continuation coverage as of
the Effective Time until the later of (i) such time as a plan maintained by
the Parent assumes such COBRA continuation coverage and (ii) such time that
the COBRA continuation coverage expires other than by reason of termination
of such Company Benefit Plan.   (b) For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, the Parent shall provide to individuals who are employed by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
("AFFECTED EMPLOYEES"), employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are
substantially equivalent to the benefits provided pursuant to the Benefit
Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c) Except to
the extent necessary to prevent the duplication of benefits, the Parent will,
or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Affected Employees full
credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and
determination of the level of benefits under any employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for such
Affected Employees\' service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (d) The Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Affected Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, at
any time from the date of this Agreement through and including the date that
is two years following the Effective Time, the employment of any person who
is an employee of the Company at the Effective Date (i) is terminated by the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation as a result of redundancy of position or
(ii) voluntarily resigns his or her employment with the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation "For Good Reason" (as defined below), then the Parent
shall cause the unvested portion of each Company Stock   48    Option
held by such employee at the Effective Time to fully accelerate and become
immediately exercisable. The determination as to whether any such termination
of employment by Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have been "as a
result of redundancy" shall be made by Mark Spagnolo (or, in the event that
Mr. Spagnolo\'s employment shall be terminated, his designee) in
his reasonable discretion following consultation in good faith with the
Parent. For the purposes of this Section 5.17(e), a resignation "FOR GOOD
REASON" shall be deemed to occur if any employee resigns his or her
employment with written notice to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation
within 30 days after the occurrence of any of the following events: (A) a
material reduction or change in job duties, responsibilities and requirements
inconsistent with the employee\'s position with the Company and the
employee\'s prior duties, responsibilities and requirements, taking into
account the differences in job title and duties that are normally occasioned
by reason of an acquisition of one company by another and that do not
actually result in a material change in duties, responsibilities and
requirements inconsistent with an employee\'s prior position with
the acquired company, (B) a reduction of greater than 5% in the aggregate
amount of the employee\'s current base salary and other non-performance
based, guaranteed cash compensation, other than as a result of poor
performance (without regard to any compensation payable as a result of the
consummation of the Merger) or (C) a relocation of principal place of
employment by more than 50 miles. The Parent agrees to deliver to the
employees of the Company prior to the Closing a letter in a form acceptable
to the Company, in its reasonable discretion, explaining the rights that each
such employee has been granted pursuant this Section 5.18.   SECTION 5.19
FORM S-8. No later than three business days following the Effective Time, the
Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate
form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration
statement under the Securities Act, with respect to the Parent Common Stock
issuable in respect of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein), as well as comply with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws, for as long as such Company Stock Options and
Company Warrants remain outstanding.   SECTION 5.20 PARENT OPTION POOL. The
Parent will grant stock options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Parent Common
Stock to the employees (other than Mark Spagnolo and Robert J. Ryan, IV) of
the Company (the "ADDITIONAL OPTION GRANT") at the Effective Time in order to
reasonably provide incentives for, and to retain, such employees after the
Effective Time. The Additional Option Grant shall be made to such employees
in such amounts as shall be mutually agreed by the Parent and the Company
prior to the Effective Time.   49      ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS

proceedings for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the
SEC, and all requests for additional information on the part of the SEC,
shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the parties
hereto.   (f) INJUNCTIONS. No court or Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law, orders, injunction or decree (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
such Laws, orders, injunctions or decrees, could reasonably be expected to

seeking any such Law, order injunction or decree.   50     (g) ESCROW

true and correct, and the other representations and warranties of the Company

Company, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent the
representation or warranty is expressly limited by its terms to another date,
and the Parent shall have received a certificate (which certificate may be

Time.   SECTION 8.2 AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY. Subject to the provisions of
Sections 8.3 and 8.4 below, the Company Stockholders (the
"INDEMNITORS") will, severally, on a PRO RATA basis, and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective officers, directors, agents, stockholders and employees, and
each person, if any, who controls or may control the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(each an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON" and collectively, "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") from
and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of actions,
losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, other professionals\' and experts\' reasonable fees and
court or arbitration costs (collectively, "DAMAGES"), directly or indirectly
incurred, resulting or and arising out of any inaccuracy, misrepresentation,
breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants
given or made by the Company in this Agreement, in the Company Disclosure
Letter, or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company of an
officer of the Company pursuant to any provision of Article 6 (if such
inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach or default existed at the Closing
Date).   SECTION 8.3 LIMITATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS TO INDEMNIFICATION.   (a)
In seeking indemnification from an Indemnitor, the Indemnified Persons will
exercise their remedies solely with respect to the Escrow Shares and any
other assets deposited in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.   (b)
The Indemnification provided for in Section 8.2 shall not apply unless and
until the aggregate cumulative Damages for which one or more  
55    Indemnified Persons have sought indemnification under this Section,
exclusive of legal fees, exceeds $750,000 (the "BASKET") and then the
indemnification shall extend to the amount of such cumulative Damages.  
SECTION 8.4 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.   (a) Promptly after receipt by an
Indemnified Person of notice of the commencement of any claim or demand
asserted by a third party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), such Indemnified Person
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Indemnitors,
notify the Escrow Representative in writing of the commencement thereof (an
"INDEMNITY NOTICE"), PROVIDED that (i) the failure to notify the Escrow
Representative will not relieve the Indemnitors from any liability which they
may have hereunder unless and except to the extent such failure results in
the forfeiture by the Indemnitors of substantial rights and defenses, and
(ii) the omission so to notify the Escrow Representative will not relieve the
Indemnitors from liability which they may have to an Indemnified Person
otherwise than on account of this indemnity or in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement. In case any such proceedings
are brought against any Indemnified Person and it notifies the Escrow
Representative of the commencement thereof, the Escrow Representative will be
entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect
by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Person, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Person; PROVIDED that, if the defendants in any such proceedings include both
the Indemnified Person and an Indemnitor, and the Indemnified Person shall
have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnitor, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert
such legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnified Person, if, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Person, (x) the Indemnitor has a
conflicting or contrary defense or position or (y) the Indemnitor fails to
adequately assert such defense. Upon receipt of notice from the Escrow
Representative to such Indemnified Person of the Escrow Representative\'s
election so to assume the defense of such proceedings and approval by the
Indemnified Person of counsel, the Indemnitor will not be liable to such
Indemnified Person for expenses incurred hereafter by the Indemnified Person
in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnified Person
shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of
legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence
(it being understood, however, that the Indemnitor shall not be liable for
the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one
local counsel firm in the jurisdiction in which any proceeding is brought),
approved by the Indemnified Parties, representing all the Indemnified Parties
who are parties to such proceedings), (ii) the Escrow Representative shall
not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person
to represent the Indemnified Person within a reasonable time after notice of
commencement of the proceedings or (iii) the Escrow Representative has
authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnified Person.
The indemnity and reimbursement obligations of an Indemnitor hereunder shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors of the Indemnitor
and any Indemnified Person. If an Indemnified Person seeks to settle any
Third Party Claim and in respect of   56    which Third Party Claim
such Indemnified Person might seek indemnity under this Section 8.4(a), then
such Indemnified Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the Escrow
Representative to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.   (b) In the event of any claim or demand,
including Third Party Claims, in respect of which an Indemnified Person might
seek indemnity under this Section 8.4(a), the Indemnified Person shall
deliver notice with reasonable promptness to the Escrow Representative. The
failure by any Indemnified Person to give notice shall not impair such
party\'s rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnitor
demonstrates that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. The Escrow
Representative will notify the Indemnified Person within the 30 day period
following its actual receipt of such notice (the "DISPUTE PERIOD") as to
whether the Escrow Representative disputes the liability to the Indemnified
Person hereunder. If the Escrow Representative notifies the Indemnified
Person that it does not dispute the claim described in such notice, or fails
to notify the Indemnified Person within the Dispute Period whether the Escrow
Representative disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the
Damages specified in the notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnitors and the Indemnitors shall pay the amount of such Loss, when
it has been finally determined, to the Indemnified Person on demand. If the
Escrow Representative has timely disputed the liability with respect to such
claim, the Escrow Representative and the Indemnified Person will proceed
in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within 60 days following the Indemnified
Person\'s receipt of a written notice from the Escrow Representative
disputing such claim, such dispute shall be finally settled by litigation in
a court of competent jurisdiction.    ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS
