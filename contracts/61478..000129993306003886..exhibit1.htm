WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of ADC has determined to recommend to its

WHEREAS, ADC, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this
Agreement and the Merger;   

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain

which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,

defined in Section 4.1(b)) shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in the form
attached as Exhibit A hereto, and such amended Andrew Charter shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until

Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL
and as provided in such by-laws.

thereafter if, with appropriate disclosure, any required further approval of
the revised structure is obtained from the stockholders of ADC and Andrew,
as applicable; _provided, however_ , that under any such revised structure
the Merger would qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or as a transfer qualifying under Section 351 of the
Code.   

Article II    

Effects of the Merger; Exchange of Certificates    

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of ADC, Merger Sub, Andrew or the holders of any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Andrew (together with
any associated Andrew Rights (as defined in Section 4.2(a)), " _Andrew Common
Stock_ "):   

(a) _Conversion of Andrew Common Stock_. Each share of Andrew Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, _other than_
any shares of Andrew Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.57 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of a fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.20 per share, of ADC (" _ADC Common Stock_ ") upon surrender of
the Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such share of Andrew Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, Section 2.2(h)). The shares of ADC Common Stock, together with
the associated ADC Rights (as defined in Section 3.2(a)), to be issued or paid
to holders of Andrew Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, together with
any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e), are
referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". As a result of the Merger, at
the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, _except_ the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Andrew Common Stock
represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to
be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b) (or, in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(h)).   

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Andrew Common Stock held
as treasury stock by Andrew, if any, shall automatically be extinguished
without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect
thereof.   

(d) _Andrew Options, Andrew Warrant, Andrew Note and Andrew Restricted Stock
Units_. At the Effective Time, (i) all issued and outstanding options to
purchase Andrew Common Stock under any Andrew Stock Plan (as defined in
Section 4.2(a)) (each, an " _Andrew Option_ ") shall be assumed by ADC in
accordance with Section 6.10(a), (ii) the warrant, dated January 16, 2006,
to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Andrew Common Stock issued to True Position,
Inc. (the " _Andrew Warrant_ ") shall be assumed by ADC in accordance with
Section 6.10(b), (iii) all issued and outstanding 3 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Notes Due 2013 (the " _Andrew Notes_ "), subject to the
indenture, dated August 8, 2003, between Andrew and BNY Midwest Trust Company
(the " _Andrew Indenture_ ") shall become convertible into ADC Common Stock
in accordance with Section 6.10(c), and (iv) all restricted stock units
issued under the Andrew Stock Plans shall be treated as set forth in Section
6.10(d).   

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of ADC Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of
Andrew Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of ADC Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of ADC
Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), receive from ADC an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price
of one share of ADC Common Stock for the ten most recent trading days that
ADC Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the
Effective Time, as reported on the NASDAQ National Market (" _NASDAQ_
").   

(f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
Section 5.1), the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into ADC
Common Stock or Andrew Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to ADC Common Stock or
Andrew Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.   

2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.   

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, ADC shall engage
Computershare Investor Services LLC (or such other institution reasonably
satisfactory to ADC and Andrew) to act as exchange agent in connection with
the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement reasonably
satisfactory to ADC and Andrew. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
ADC shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Andrew Common Stock, the shares of ADC Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a). In addition, ADC shall make available by
depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Andrew Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All cash and ADC Common Stock deposited
with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, ADC shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Andrew Common Stock and that at the Effective Time were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1 (the " _Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for whole shares of ADC Common Stock, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of whole shares of ADC
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 (which,
as required by the ADC By-Laws (as defined in Section 3.1(b)), shall be issued
in uncertificated book entry form only), payment in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Andrew Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Andrew, the proper number of shares of ADC Common Stock
may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of ADC Common Stock to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of ADC
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c))
upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c).   

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to ADC Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of ADC Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(e), until such Certificate has been
surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject to Applicable Law (as
defined in Section 3.7(a)), following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest,
(i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of ADC Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, together
with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of ADC Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of ADC Common Stock,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of ADC
Common Stock.   

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Andrew Common Stock_. All shares of ADC
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (and
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Andrew
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Andrew shall be closed and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Andrew Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.   

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to ADC, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to ADC for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section
2.2(c).   

(f) _No Liability_. None of ADC, Merger Sub, Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of ADC
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective
Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of ADC
Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of ADC Common Stock or
any dividends or distributions with respect to ADC Common Stock issuable
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.3(e)), any such
shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.   

(g) _Withholding Rights_. ADC or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person who was a holder of Andrew Common Stock, options or other
securities or rights immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as
ADC or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by ADC or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such consideration would otherwise have been paid.   

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of ADC Common
Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash for
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c); _provided, however_ , that
ADC may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to ADC, or a bond in such sum as ADC may reasonably direct as
indemnity, against any claim that may be made against ADC or the Exchange
Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.   

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by ADC on a daily basis _provided_
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
former stockholders of Andrew after the Effective Time pursuant to this
Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to
ADC.   

Article III

_GAAP_ ") or the accounting rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), (B) any change in the market price or

operating in such markets or industries or serving such markets, or (G) any
change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts arising directly or
indirectly out of the execution, delivery, performance or disclosure of this

and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (i) increase any amounts or benefits
otherwise payable or due to any such Person under any ADC Benefit Plan or

or

Material Contract, _except_ in each case for those breaches, violations
and defaults which would not permit any other party to cancel or terminate
such ADC Material Contract, and would not permit any other party to seek
damages or other remedies (for any or all of such breaches violations or

controls and procedures prior to the date hereof, to ADCs auditors and the

cancel or terminate such Andrew Material Contract, and would not permit any
other party to seek damages or other remedies (for any or all of such
breaches, violations or defaults, individually or in the aggregate) which
would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Andrew.   

4.18 _Interested Party Transactions_. Since the date of the Andrew Balance
Sheet, no event has occurred that would be required to be reported as a
Certain Relationship or Related Transaction pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 or Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the
SEC.   

4.19 _Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls_. Andrew and its Subsidiaries
have designed and maintain a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting. Andrew (i) has designed and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by
Andrew in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to Andrews management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date hereof, to Andrews auditors and the audit committee of Andrews Board
of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Andrews
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Andrews internal controls over
financial reporting.   

4.20 _Andrew Rights Agreement_. Andrew has taken all action so that the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of
any rights to any Person under the Andrew Rights Agreement or enable, require
or cause the Andrew Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. The
Board of Directors of Andrew has approved an amendment to the Andrew Rights
Agreement to provide that the Andrew Rights will terminate immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

5.2 _No Solicitation_.   

(a) The following terms will have the definitions set forth below:

mean any of the following transactions: (i) any transaction or series of
related transactions with one or more third Persons involving: (A) any
purchase from such party or acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of more than a 20% interest in the total outstanding
voting securities of such party or any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or group beneficially owning 20% or
more of the total outstanding voting securities of such party or any merger,
consolidation or business combination involving such party as a whole, or (B)
any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary

outstanding voting securities of such party, and as a result of which, the
stockholders of such party immediately preceding such transaction would hold
less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction (or its ultimate parent), which the Board of
Directors of such party has in good faith determined (taking into account,
among other things, (1) the advice of its outside legal counsel and its
financial adviser, and (2) all terms of such Alternative Transaction Proposal
and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by the other party
hereto), to be more favorable to such partys stockholders (in their
capacities as stockholders) than the terms of this Agreement (as it may be
proposed to be amended by the other party hereto) and to be reasonably
capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account, all
other legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the Person making such Alternative
Transaction Proposal including, if such Alternative Transaction Proposal
involves any financing, the likelihood of obtaining such financing and the
terms on which such financing may be secured.   

(b) Neither ADC nor Andrew shall, nor shall either of them permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or
employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly, or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing any information), or take any other action intended to
facilitate, induce or encourage, any inquiries with respect to, or the
making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal,
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person any information with respect to, any, or any possible,
Alternative Transaction Proposal (except (A) to disclose the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.2, or (B) to the extent specifically permitted
pursuant to Section 5.2(d)), (iii) approve, endorse or recommend
any Alternative Transaction (except to the extent specifically permitted

of ADC and Andrew and each of their respective Subsidiaries will immediately

investment banker, financial adviser, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it to cease, any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to any possible or proposed Alternative Transaction,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce (and not waive any
provisions of) any confidentiality and standstill agreement (or any
similar agreement) relating to any such possible or proposed Alternative
Transaction.   

(c) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) after
receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or any inquiry relating to any Alternative Transaction Proposal,
ADC or Andrew, as the case may be, shall provide the other party with oral
and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the
Person or group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or
inquiry. In addition, ADC or Andrew, as the case may be, shall provide the
other party as promptly as practicable with oral and written notice
setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep the
other party informed in all material respects of all material developments
regarding the status and terms (including material amendments or proposed
material amendments) of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
request or inquiry, and, without limitation of the other provisions of this
Section 5.2, shall promptly provide to the other party a copy of all written
materials (including written materials provided by e-mail or otherwise in
electronic format) subsequently provided by or to it in connection with
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. ADC or Andrew, as
the case may be, shall provide the other party with 48 hours prior notice
(or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of
Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of
Directors is reasonably likely to consider any Alternative Transaction
Proposal or Alternative Transaction.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b), in
the event that ADC or Andrew, as the case may be, receives an unsolicited,
bona fide Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined by its Board
of Directors to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, it may then take the following actions (but only (1) if and to the
extent that (x) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after receipt
of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its
stockholders under Applicable Law and (y) ADC or Andrew, as the case may be,
has given the other party at least three business days prior written notice
of its intention to take any of the following actions and of the identity of
the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and (2) if it shall not have breached in
any material respect any of the provisions of this Section 5.2 or Section
5.4):    

(i) furnish nonpublic information to the Person or group making such Superior
Proposal,  _provided_ that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information, it receives from such Person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive as the
terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2006,
between Andrew and ADC (the " _CA_ "), and (B) contemporaneously with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or group, it
furnishes such nonpublic information to the other party hereto (to the extent
such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to such
party); and    

(ii) engage in negotiations with such Person or group with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , in no event shall such party enter
into any definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal.   

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit ADC or Andrew or their
respective Boards of Directors from taking and disclosing to their
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure required by Applicable
Law.   

5.3 _Board of Directors Recommendation_.   

(a) In response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona fide Alternative
Transaction Proposal which is determined by the Board of Directors of Andrew
or ADC, as the case may be, to be a Superior Proposal, such Board of
Directors may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor
of, in the case of Andrew, approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger and, in the case of ADC, the ADC Share Issuance, and, in the case
of a Superior Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to
its stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by a Board of Directors
or a committee thereof, a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Board
of Directors of ADC or Andrew, as the case may be, has concluded in good
faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a
Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law.   

(b) Prior to announcing any Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section
5.3(a), ADC or Andrew, as the case may be, shall (A) provide to the other
party hereto three business days prior written notice which shall (x) state
expressly that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and (y)
describe any modifications to the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group making the Superior
Proposal from the description of such terms and conditions and such Person
contained in the notice required under Section 5.2(d), (B) make available to
the other party hereto all materials and information made available to the
Person or group making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior
Proposal, and (C) during the three business-day period commencing upon
receipt of the notice described in Section 5.3(b)(A), if requested by the
other party hereto, engage in good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that the Alternative Transaction Proposal which was
determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal.   

(c) In addition to the circumstances set forth in Section 5.3(a), the Board of
Directors of ADC may effect a Change of Recommendation (but only insofar as
the same involves withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
recommendation in favor of the ADC Share Issuance) if there shall have
occurred and be continuing:    

(i) a Material Adverse Change of Andrew since the date of this Agreement,
or    

(ii) any other event, occurrence or circumstance as a result of which, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of ADC, after consultation with
outside counsel of ADC, the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation
would violate the fiduciary duties of the ADC Board of Directors to ADCs
shareholders under Applicable Law.   

(d) In addition to the circumstances set forth in Section 5.3(a), the Board of
Directors of Andrew may effect a Change of Recommendation (but only insofar
as the same involves withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
recommendation in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger) if there shall have occurred and be continuing:    

(i) a Material Adverse Change of ADC since the date of this Agreement,
or    

(ii) any other event, occurrence or circumstance as a result of which, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Andrew, after consultation
with outside counsel of Andrew, the failure to effect a Change in
Recommendation would violate the fiduciary duties of the Andrew Board of
Directors to Andrews stockholders under Applicable Law.   

(e) If the Board of Directors of Andrew or ADC has effected a Change of
Recommendation, Andrew or ADC, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other
party in writing of such Change in Recommendation, including the specific
subparagraph, but not more than one subparagraph, of Section 5.3 in reliance
upon which such Change in Recommendation is made. If the other
party thereafter terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1
based upon such notice, then the termination effects with respect to the
specific subparagraph identified in such notice that are set forth in Section
8.3 shall apply.   

5.4 _Company Stockholder Meetings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the obligation of ADC or Andrew to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the ADC Shareholders Meeting or the Andrew
Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it
of any Alternative Transaction Proposal with respect to it, or by any Change
of Recommendation. At any such meeting, neither ADC nor Andrew shall submit
to the vote of its respective stockholders any Alternative Transaction,
whether or not a Superior Proposal has been received by it, or propose to do
so.   

5.5 _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed to give ADC, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct Andrews operations or give Andrew, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct ADCs operations, in each case, prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of ADC and Andrew
shall exercise, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its respective operations.   

Article VI    

Additional Agreements

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Andrew and
ADC shall agree upon the terms of, prepare and file with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement, and ADC shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Andrew and ADC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing. Andrew will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Andrews stockholders, and ADC will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to ADCs stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. ADC shall also
take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of
process) reasonably required to be taken under any applicable
state securities laws in connection with the ADC Share Issuance and, and
Andrew shall furnish all information concerning Andrew and the holders of
Andrew Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement or any filing with the SEC
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, in
each case prior to filing such with the SEC, except where doing so
would cause the filing to not be filed timely, without regard to any
extension pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ ,
that each party shall be deemed to have consented to the inclusion in the
Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement or any filing with the SEC incorporated
by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement of any information,
language or content specifically agreed to by such party or its counsel on or
prior to the date hereof for inclusion therein. ADC will advise Andrew
promptly after it receives notice of (i) the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, (ii) the
issuance or threat of any stop order, (iii) the suspension of the
qualification of the ADC Common Stock issuable in connection with this
Agreement for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or (iv) any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
(including any Change of Recommendation) relating to Andrew or ADC, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered
by Andrew or ADC which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement, including, where appropriate, a
filing pursuant to Rules 165 and 425 of the Securities Act, describing such
information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Andrew and ADC.   

(b) Each of ADC and Andrew shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action necessary
in accordance with Applicable Law and the ADC Organizational Documents, in
the case of ADC, and the Andrew Organizational Documents, in the case of
Andrew, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
to be held as promptly as practicable to consider, in the case of Andrew, the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Andrew
Stockholders  Meeting_"), and, in the case of ADC, the ADC Share Issuance
(the " _ADC Shareholders  Meeting_"). Except in the case of a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, each of ADC and Andrew will
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of, in the case of Andrew, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of ADC, the ADC Share Issuance, and
will take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of NASDAQ or
Applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, ADC or Andrew may adjourn or postpone
the ADC Shareholders Meeting or Andrew Stockholders Meeting, as the case
may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its respective
stockholders in advance of a vote on, in the case of Andrew, the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of ADC, the ADC
Share Issuance, or, if, as of the time for which the ADC Shareholders Meeting
or Andrew Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of ADC Common Stock or Andrew Common Stock, as
the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Each of ADC and
Andrew shall use commercially reasonable efforts such that the ADC
Shareholders Meeting and the Andrew Stockholders Meeting, respectively, is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
in connection with the ADC Shareholders Meeting or Andrew Stockholders
Meeting, as the case may be, are solicited in compliance with Applicable
Law, the rules of the NASDAQ and, in the case of ADC, the ADC Organizational
Documents, and, in the case of Andrew, the Andrew Organizational Documents.
Without the prior written consent of Andrew, the ADC Share Issuance is the
only matter which ADC shall propose to be acted on by ADCs shareholders at
the ADC Shareholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of ADC, the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is the only matter
which Andrew shall propose to be acted on by Andrews stockholders at the
Andrew Stockholders Meeting.   

(c) Each of ADC and Andrew will use commercially reasonable efforts to hold
the ADC Shareholders Meeting and Andrew Stockholders Meeting, respectively,
on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, subject to the requirements of Instruction
D.3 to Schedule 14A (Rule 14a-101) promulgated under the Exchange Act.   

(d) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.3: (i) the Board of
Directors of each of Andrew and ADC shall recommend that its stockholders
vote in favor of, in the case of Andrew, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Andrew Stockholders Meeting, and, in the
case of ADC, the ADC Share Issuance at the ADC Shareholders Meeting, (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Board of Directors of (A) ADC has recommended that ADCs shareholders vote in
favor of the ADC Share Issuance at the ADC Shareholders Meeting and (B)
Andrew has recommended that Andrews stockholders vote in favor of approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Andrew Stockholders
Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of ADC or Andrew nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the
recommendation of its respective Board of Directors that the
respective stockholders of ADC or Andrew vote in favor of, in the case of
Andrew, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and, in
the case of ADC, the ADC Share Issuance.   

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.   

(a) Subject to the CA and Applicable Law, each of Andrew and ADC shall, and
shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party
and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives of such other party, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all
their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records (provided that such access shall not interfere with the business or
operations of such party) and, during such period, each of Andrew and ADC
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request. No review pursuant to this Section 6.2
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.   

(b) Each of Andrew and ADC will hold, and will cause its respective officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information received from the other
party in confidence in accordance with the terms of the CA.   

(c) If, on the date that is five business days before the date that the
parties obligations under the CA terminate, (i) the Effective Time has not
occurred and (ii) this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Section
8.1, then the parties shall amend the CA to extend the term of each partys
obligations under the CA to earlier of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the date
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1.   

6.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.   

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied (but in no event shall a party be required to
waive any such condition) as promptly as practicable; (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings, including all filings required by the HSR Act (the
initial filing required by the HSR Act to be filed as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within 15 days, following the execution of this
Agreement) and any applicable antitrust, competition or similar laws of any
foreign jurisdiction, and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
furtherance of the covenants contained in Sections 6.3(a)(ii) and 6.3(a)(iv),
ADC and Andrew shall, if required by one or more Governmental Entities acting
pursuant to any applicable antitrust, competition or similar laws to obtain
any of the actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, or
avoidance of actions or proceedings referred to in Sections 6.3(a)(ii), or
pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(iv) or if required by a federal, state or foreign
court, agree to the divestiture by ADC, Andrew or any of their respective
Subsidiaries of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property
of ADC or its Subsidiaries or Andrew or its Subsidiaries and the imposition
of any limitation on the ability of ADC or its Subsidiaries or Andrew or its
Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses or to own or exercise
control of their respective assets, properties and stock (including licenses,
hold separate agreements, covenants affecting business operating practices
or similar matters) if such divestitures and limitations, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to result in the loss of
annualized revenue of ADC and Andrew on a combined consolidated basis of more
than $225,000,000. Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information and in addition to Section 6.3(b), ADC and Andrew, or their
respective counsel, shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to ADC and its Subsidiaries or Andrew and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(b) Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each
of Andrew and ADC shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required approvals,
consents or clearances of any Governmental Entity (whether domestic, foreign
or supranational). In that regard, each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing,
furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally of) any communications from or with
any Governmental Entity (whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with
respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any
such Governmental Entity, (iii) not participate in any meeting with any such
Governmental Entity unless it consults with the other in advance and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity gives the other the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat, (iv) furnish the other with copies of
all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and (v) furnish the other with such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as Andrew or ADC
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity. Each
of Andrew and ADC shall designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 6.3 as "outside counsel only." Such
material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Andrew or ADC, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.   

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Andrew and ADC
shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to
ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

6.4 _Indemnification and Insurance_.   

(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the present
and former officers and directors of Andrew and its Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as those contained in the Andrew Charter and
the Andrew By-laws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees or agents of Andrew, unless such modification
is required by law. ADC shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions
taken by them in their capacity as officers or directors at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby), or taken by them at the request of Andrew,
ADC, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law for a period of six years after
the Effective Time. Each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten Business Days of
receipt of the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; _provided, however_ , that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Neither ADC nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or claim in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, without the consent of such
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim.   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, ADC shall purchase a directors and officers
and fiduciary liability insurance policy providing coverage for a period of
at least six years following the Effective Time (i) for persons who were
officers and/or directors of Andrew prior to the Effective Time and (ii) for
persons who were officers and/or directors of ADC prior to the Effective Time
and who are not officers or directors of ADC immediately following the
Effective Time, in each case for claims arising after the Effective Time from
facts or events which occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, and in each
case, which policy shall provide for at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than the
respective policies of ADC and Andrew, as in place at the Effective Time;
_provided, however_ , that in no event will ADC be required to expend in any
year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual aggregate premiums currently
paid by ADC or Andrew, as applicable, for such insurance (the " _Maximum
Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can
only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, ADC
will cause to be maintained the most advantageous policies of directors and
officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium.   

(c) In the event that ADC or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that
the successors and assigns of ADC assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.4.   

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Party may have had by contract or otherwise.   

6.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 6.5 and
in Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses (including each partys
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement to its respective shareholders), whether or not the
Merger is consummated, _provided_ that Andrew shall pay any foreign, state or
local real estate transfer or similar taxes imposed on the stockholders of
Andrew as a result of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. ADC
and Andrew shall each bear one-half of the filing fees required by the
HSR Act and any antitrust, competition or similar laws of any foreign
jurisdiction. ADC shall bear the fee to the SEC for the Form S-4 (including
any amendments thereto).   

6.6 _Announcements_. ADC and Andrew will consult with each other before
issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon
and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on, any
press release, public statements or other announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any announcement to
employees, customers, suppliers or others having dealings with ADC or
Andrew, respectively, or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement or other announcement prior
to such consultation, _except_ as either party may determine is required
by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market.   

6.7 _Listing_. ADC shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the ADC
Common Stock issuable under Article II and those shares of ADC Common Stock
required to be reserved for issuance under the Andrew Stock Plans, the Andrew
Warrant and the Andrew Indenture to be authorized for listing on the NASDAQ,
upon notice of issuance, exercise or conversion, as applicable.   

6.8 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. Andrew and ADC intend that the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and each shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither Andrew nor
ADC shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any commercially reasonable action or cause any commercially reasonable
action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would reasonably
be expected to (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code or (ii) cause Andrew, Merger
Sub or ADC to be unable to make the representations necessary for counsel to
render the tax opinions referred to in Section 7.1(h).   

6.9 _Conveyance Taxes_. ADC and Andrew shall cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees or any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time,
and any such taxes shall be paid one-half by ADC and one-half by
Andrew.   

6.10 _Equity Awards, Andrew Warrant and Andrew Note_.   

(a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Andrew Option, whether or not
exercisable at the Effective Time, will be assumed by ADC. Each Andrew Option
so assumed by ADC under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Andrew Option
(including any Andrew Stock Plan under which such Andrew Option was
issued and any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such Andrew Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time, _except that_
(i) each Andrew Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
ADC Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Andrew
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Andrew Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of ADC Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of ADC Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Andrew Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of such Andrew Option by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As of the Effective
Time, all references in the Andrew Stock Plans to Andrew Common Stock shall
thereafter be deemed to be references to ADC Common Stock. As soon
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five business days following the Effective Time, ADC shall file a
registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or another
appropriate form (and use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) with respect to Andrew Options assumed by ADC pursuant
hereto and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to remain in effect for so long as such assumed
Andrew Option shall remain outstanding. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Andrew Stock Plans provide for accelerated vesting, at the
Effective Time, of the Andrew Options. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, between the date hereof and the Effective Time,
Andrew shall not grant any options, restricted stock units or make any other
award or grant under the Andrew 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.   

(b) At the Effective Time, the Andrew Warrant will be assumed by ADC. The
Andrew Warrant will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Andrew Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time, _except that_ (i) the Andrew Warrant will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of ADC Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Andrew Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of the
Andrew Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of ADC
Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of ADC
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Andrew Warrant will be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of the
Andrew Warrant by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
As of the Effective Time, all references in the Andrew Warrant to Andrew
Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be references to ADC Common
Stock.   

(c) At the Effective Time and subject to the satisfaction of the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(i), the Andrew Notes will be assumed by ADC. The Andrew
Notes will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
set forth in the Andrew Note and the Andrew Indenture immediately prior to
the Effective Time, _except that_ the Andrew Notes will be convertible into
that number of whole shares of ADC Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Andrew Common Stock that were issuable upon conversion of
such Andrew Notes immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of ADC
Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, all references in the Andrew Notes and
the Andrew Indenture to Andrew Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be
references to ADC Common Stock.   

(d) At the Effective Time, all restricted stock units granted under the Andrew
Stock Plans will vest as provided under the Andrew Stock Plans and will be
converted into the right to receive the number of whole shares of ADC Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Andrew Common Stock to
which such restricted stock units relate multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of ADC Common
Stock. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Andrew Stock Plans
provide for the lapse, at the Effective Time, of any restrictions on
restricted stock units issued pursuant to the Andrew Stock Plans.   

(e) At the Effective Time, any share of Andrew Common Stock issued under the
Andrew Stock Plans with restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect
thereto shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the respective
Andrew Stock Plan under which such shares were issued, and the shares of ADC
Common Stock issued in exchange for such Andrew Common Stock hereunder
shall have the same restrictions and limitations, if any, as such shares of
Andrew Common Stock exchanged therefor at the Effective Time. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Andrew Purchase Plan provides for the
lapse, at the Effective Time, of any restrictions on Andrew Common
Stock issued pursuant to the Andrew Purchase Plan.   

(f) Andrew and ADC shall take any and all actions necessary to effect the
provisions of Section 2.1(d) above pursuant to the Andrew Indenture.   

6.11 _Employee Benefits_.   

(a) For one year following the Effective Time, with respect to each country in
which Andrew has an employee workforce, ADC shall provide or cause to be
provided to the employee workforce of the Surviving Corporation and the other
members of the employee workforce of any other Affiliate of ADC who were
employees of Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), employee benefits that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee benefits package provided
to the Continuing Employees in such country by Andrew or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to Applicable Law, if ADC
has an employee workforce in such country, ADC may, in lieu thereof, provide
to the Continuing Employees the benefits package offered to ADCs employee
workforce in such country immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.11(a) to the
contrary, each employee of Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any
director or officer of Andrew, who is covered and eligible for benefits under
an Andrew Domestic Benefit Plan that provides for payment of cash severance
benefits upon certain employment termination shall, upon termination
of employment within one year following the Effective Time receive the
severance benefits provided by either the ADC Domestic Benefit Plans or the
Andrew Domestic Benefit Plans applicable to non-officer and non-director
employees. The designation of whether the ADC Domestic Benefit Plans or the
Andrew Domestic Benefit Plans will be applicable shall be determined by which
set of benefit plans would pay the highest cash severance payments to such
terminated employee.   

(b) Following the Effective Time, ADC shall recognize (or cause to be
recognized) the service of each Continuing Employee with Andrew or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any ADC
Benefit Plan, (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation
or severance ADC Benefit Plan and (iii) determination of "retiree" status
under any ADC Benefit Plan, for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise
eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, in
each case _except_ where such crediting would result in a duplication
of benefits. To the extent ADC establishes or designates an ADC Benefit Plan
to provide group health benefits to Continuing Employees, (x) each such ADC
Benefit Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations with respect to
Continuing Employees to the same extent waived or no longer applicable under
the applicable group health plan of Andrew and (y) each Continuing Employee
shall be given credit under the applicable ADC Benefit Plan for amounts paid
under the corresponding group health plan of Andrew or an Affiliate during
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums for such plan year.   

(c) As of the Effective Time, ADC shall assume all rights (including the
rights to modify in accordance with their terms) under and agree to perform
in accordance with their terms (i) all employment, severance and other
compensation agreements and arrangements existing as of the date hereof (and
provided to ADC by Andrew prior to the date hereof) between Andrew or any of
its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee thereof, and (ii) any
such agreements or arrangements entered into after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time by Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries in compliance with
the terms of this Agreement.   

(d) Andrew shall, if requested to do so by ADC, take any action required to
terminate its defined contribution 401(k) plan, such termination to be
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and to be contingent upon
the Closing; provided, however, that Andrew shall make a profit sharing
contribution to such plan for 2006 for allocation among eligible employees.
ADC shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that
each Continuing Employee who is a participant in Andrews 401(k) plan shall
be given the opportunity to "roll over" his or her account balance (including
any promissory note evidencing an outstanding loan) from the terminated plan
to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by ADC or the
Surviving Corporation.   

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.7, nothing in this Agreement
will be construed to create a right in any employee of Andrew or any
Subsidiary to employment with ADC, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Subsidiary of ADC or grant or create any right in any employee or beneficiary
of such employee under an ADC Benefit Plan or an Andrew Benefit Plan.   

6.12 _Consents of Accountants_. Andrew and ADC will each use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to each other consents from their
respective independent auditors, dated the date on which the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, is amended or supplemented, or becomes effective or a
date not more than two days prior to such date, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance for
consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.   

6.13 _Directors and Chief Executive Officer of ADC_. The Board of Directors of
ADC shall take all action within its power so that:   

(a) immediately following the Effective Time, the (i) Board of Directors of
ADC shall consist of 12 directors, who shall be the four Persons identified
in Section 6.13(a) of the Andrew Disclosure Letter (collectively the "
_Andrew Designated Directors_ ") and the eight Persons identified in Section
6.13(a) of the ADC Disclosure Letter (collectively the " _ADC
Designated Directors_ "), and each such director shall serve for a term
expiring at ADCs annual meeting of shareholders for the year indicated in
Section 6.13(a) of the Andrew Disclosure Letter or the ADC Disclosure Letter,
as appropriate, and (ii) the Chairman of the Board of Directors of ADC shall
be ADCs Chairman of the Board of Directors immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and   

(b) immediately following the Effective Time, the chief executive officer of
ADC shall be ADCs chief executive officer immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   

6.14 _Affiliate Legends_. Section 6.14 of the Andrew Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of those Persons who are, in Andrews reasonable judgment,
"affiliates" of Andrew within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act (" _Rule 145 Affiliates_"). Andrew shall notify ADC in
writing regarding any change in the identity of its Rule 145 Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date. ADC shall be entitled to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for ADC Common Stock (provided
that such legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed one year
after the Effective Time upon the request of any holder of shares of ADC
Common Stock issued in the Merger if such holder is not then a Rule 145
Affiliate).   

6.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Andrew shall give prompt notice to
ADC, and ADC shall give prompt notice to Andrew, of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event, which is in Andrews or ADCs Knowledge, as
applicable, and as to which the occurrence or failure to occur would
reasonably be likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set

9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to a " _Person_ "
shall include references to an individual, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, association, trust,
unincorporated organization or other entity. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. All references to
dollar amounts shall be to lawful currency of the United States.   

9.4 _Knowledge_. References to the " _Knowledge_ " of a party to this
Agreement shall mean, (i) in the case of Andrew, the actual knowledge of the
Persons listed in Section 9.4 of the Andrew Disclosure Letter after due
inquiry, and (ii) in the case of ADC and Merger Sub, the actual knowledge of
the Persons listed in Section 9.4 of the ADC Disclosure Letter after
due inquiry.   

9.5 _Disclosure Letters_. On or prior to the date of this Agreement, ADC has
delivered to Andrew a disclosure letter (the " _ADC Disclosure Letter_ ") and
Andrew has delivered to ADC a disclosure letter (the " _Andrew Disclosure
Letter_ "). Each Disclosure Letter sets forth items of disclosure with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the information in such Disclosure Letter relates; _provided,
however_ , that any information set forth in one section of a Disclosure
Letter will be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection of this
Agreement to which its relevance is reasonably apparent; _provided_
, further, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the inclusion of an item in such section of the Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event
or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on ADC or Andrew, as appropriate.   

9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.   

9.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the CA and the documents and instruments referred to herein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and (b) _except for_ the provisions of
Article II (which are intended to benefit the holders of Andrew Common Stock)
and Section 6.4 (which are intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties,
including Indemnified Parties who or which are not parties hereto), is not
intended to confer upon any Person _other than_ the parties any rights
or remedies.   

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws
thereof.   

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part,
by operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in
the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court _other than_ a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or a
Delaware state court.   

9.11 _Headings, etc_. The headings and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   

9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.   

9.13 _Failure or Indulgence Not a Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence
in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies
existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any
rights or remedies otherwise available.   

9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF ADC, MERGER SUB AND ANDREW HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HERBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ADC, MERGER SUB OR ANDREW IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.   

9.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity.
