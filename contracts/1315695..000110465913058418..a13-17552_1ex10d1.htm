prepare and deliver to Buyer, or shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Buyer, a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its
good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash Balances, Capex
Shortfall, and Transferred Company Indebtedness, determined in accordance with
the definitions of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash Balances, Capex
Shortfall, Transferred Company Indebtedness and, except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.4(a) of the Disclosure Letter_, GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the application of such principles in the preparation of the
Balance Sheet; _provided_ that the Retained Cash Balances and Transferred
Company Indebtedness included in the Estimated Closing Statement shall not
include any Retained Cash Balances or Transferred Company Indebtedness arising
under any Enterprise Agreements, which amount, if any, shall be included in
the final determination of the Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company
Indebtedness.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 1.2 as if Parents estimate of Closing Working
Capital, Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement was the actual amount of Closing Working
Capital, Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness. The
Purchase Price as so estimated is referred to as the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Estimated Purchase Price_." The Estimated Closing Statement shall be
accompanied by a certificate executed by a senior financial officer of Parent
to the effect that the Estimated Closing Statement has been prepared in good
faith in accordance with this Section 1.5.

 



 

(c) On or prior to the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Final
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of
Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company
Indebtedness, determined in accordance with the definitions of Closing Working
Capital, Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness, and GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the application of such principles in the
preparation of the Balance Sheet. The Final Closing Statement shall be
accompanied by a certificate executed by a senior financial officer of Buyer
to the effect that the Final Closing Statement has been prepared in good faith
in accordance with this Section 1.5(c). The Final Closing Statement shall also
set forth, and explain, in reasonable detail, any differences between Buyers
calculation of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash Balances and Transferred
Company Indebtedness from Parents estimate of Closing Working Capital,
Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall make available to Parent all workpapers and other books and
records utilized by Buyer in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement,
and shall make available to Parent those employees and representatives
involved in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement. If Buyer employs a
firm of independent accountants in connection with the preparation of the
Final Closing Statement, subject to the execution by Parent of a customary
non-reliance letter, Buyer shall cause such independent accountants to deliver
to Parent and its representatives any computations and workpapers used in the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement. Parent shall notify Buyer in
writing within forty-five (45) days after Parents receipt of the Final
Closing Statement that it accepts the Final Closing Statement or that there is
a dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") as to any item reflected thereon (the "
_Disputed Items_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set forth, and explain, Parents
objections, if any, to the Final Closing Statement in reasonable detail and
Parents calculation of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash Balances and
Transferred Company Indebtedness. If Parent timely delivers to Buyer a Dispute
Notice, only the Disputed Items shall be deemed to be in dispute, and all
other matters included in the Final Closing Statement delivered by Buyer shall
be deemed to be final and binding on the parties hereto. The failure by Parent
to deliver to Buyer the Dispute Notice within such period shall be deemed to
constitute Parents acceptance of the Final Closing Statement. After delivery
of the Dispute Notice by Parent, the parties will use all reasonable efforts
to resolve any Disputed Items, and any resolution by Parent and Buyer of such
Disputed Items shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.

 



 

(e) If any Disputed Items cannot be resolved by the parties within forty-five
(45) days after Parent delivers the Dispute Notice to Buyer, such Disputed
Items shall be referred to BDO USA, LLP (the " _Selected Accountant_ "). The
determination of the Selected Accountant shall be conclusive and binding on
each party. The fees and expenses of the Selected Accountant shall initially
be shared equally by Parent and Buyer; _provided_ , that such fees shall
ultimately be allocated in accordance with Section 1.5(h). Not later than
thirty (30) days after the referral of any Disputed Items to the Selected
Accountant, Parent and Buyer shall

 



      
 

 



 

simultaneously submit written statements to the Selected Accountant (with a
copy to the other party) setting forth their respective positions regarding
the Disputed Items which remain in dispute. Parent and Buyer shall instruct
the Selected Accountant to render its decision resolving the dispute within 30
days after submission of the written statements, and during such period, the
parties shall make available to the Selected Accountant such employees,
information, books and records as may be reasonably requested by the Selected
Accountant to make its final determination. In resolving any Disputed Item,
the Selected Accountant (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section
1.5 and the definitions of the Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash Balances
and Transferred Company Indebtedness, (ii) shall limit its review to the
Disputed Items submitted to the Selected Accountant for resolution, and shall
be instructed not to otherwise investigate matters independently and (iii)
shall further limit its review of the Disputed Items solely to whether the
Final Closing Statement has been prepared in accordance with this Section 1.5
or contains any mathematical or clerical error. The determination of any
Disputed Items cannot, however, be in excess of, or less than, the greatest or
lowest value, respectively, claimed for any such item in the Final Closing
Statement or the Dispute Notice. Parent and Buyer agree that the resolution by
the Selected Accountant of any Disputed Items shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto. Parent and Buyer agree that the procedure set forth in
this Section 1.5 for resolving disputes with respect to Closing Working
Capital, Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness shall be
the sole and exclusive method for resolving such disputes, _provided_ that the
parties hereto agree that judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Selected Accountant in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced.

 



 

(f) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.5
(f) is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Parent shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the shortfall, or (ii) is more than the Estimated Purchase
Price, Buyer shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the excess. Any such
payment pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account (or accounts) designated by Buyer
or Parent, as the case may be, on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Business
Day after acceptance or deemed acceptance by Parent of the Final Closing
Statement (as contemplated by paragraph (d) above) or (y) the second (2nd)
Business Day following resolution (as contemplated by paragraphs (d) or (e)
above) of any Disputed Items; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties are
disputing the final calculation of the Purchase Price, to the extent part of
any payment that would be payable pursuant to this paragraph (f) is not in
dispute, the payor shall pay the amount not in dispute on the date the payment
would otherwise be due but for such dispute by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account (or accounts) designated by the recipient. All
payments made pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be accompanied by interest
at a rate equal to the Prime Rate per annum from the Closing Date through (but
excluding) the date such payment is made. " _Prime Rate_ " shall mean, for any
day, the rate of interest per annum (over a year of 360 days) announced by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor thereto) from time to time, as its
"base rate" in effect on such date. Any amounts payable by either party
pursuant to this paragraph (f) may not be reduced by set-off against any
amount(s) payable (whether at such time or in the future or upon the
occurrence of a contingency) by the recipient or any Affiliate of the
recipient to the payor or any Affiliates of the payor. Any payment required
pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall constitute a payment in respect of the
Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) If the delivery deadline date for the Final Closing Statement or the
Dispute Notice is a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable delivery
deadline date shall be the immediately following Business Day.

 



 

(h) In the event Parent and Buyer refer any Disputed Items to the Selected
Accountant for resolution as provided in this Section 1.5, the responsibility
for the fees and expenses of the Selected Accountant shall be as follows:

 



 

(i) if the Selected Accountant resolves all such Disputed Items in favor of
Buyers position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as
the " _Low Value_ "), then Parent shall be responsible for all of the fees and
expenses of the Selected Accountant;

 



 

(ii) if the Selected Accountant resolves all such Disputed Items in favor of
Parents position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as
the " _High Value_ "), then Buyer shall be responsible for all of the fees and
expenses of the Selected Accountant; and

 



 

(iii) if the Selected Accountant neither resolves all such Disputed Items in
favor of Buyers position nor resolves all such Disputed Items in favor of the
Parents position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as
the " _Actual Value_ "), then that fraction of the fees and expenses of the
Selected Accountant equal to (x) the difference between the High Value and the
Actual Value over (y) the difference between the High Value and the Low Value
shall be paid by Parent and Buyer shall be responsible for the remainder of
the fees and expenses of the Selected Accountant.

 



 

1.6 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any Taxes
from any amount otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as it
reasonably determines that it is required by Legal Requirements to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that Buyer
so withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be (A) paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority and (B) treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and
Seller agree that VAT, which is governed by Section 9.2(a), does not
constitute a withholding Tax for purposes of this section.

dated as of the date of this Agreement, delivered by Parent to Buyer

Letter_ "), Parent hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

2.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the other Sellers is a corporation (or
other Entity) validly existing and (if such Entity is organized in a
jurisdiction in which the concept of good standing or its functional
equivalent is applicable) in good standing or its functional equivalent under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. _Schedule 2.1 of the Disclosure
Letter_ lists each Company and each Subsidiary of the Companies (together with
the Companies, the " _Transferred Companies_ ") and the business entity form

equivalent under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and (ii)
qualified to do business and in good standing or its functional equivalent in
each jurisdiction in which the Assets owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it requires such qualification, in each
case, if such concepts or their functional equivalent are applicable in such
jurisdiction, except, if applicable, for such failures to be so qualified and
in good standing or its functional equivalent which are not material to the
operation of the Business, taken as a whole. Each Transferred Company has all
requisite corporate (or other Entity) authority under the Legal Requirements
pursuant to which it is organized to own, lease or operate the Assets owned,
leased or operated by it and to carry on the business as it is now being
conducted by it. _Schedule 2.1(b) of the Disclosure Letter_ sets forth each

other equity interests owned by the applicable Seller or Transferred Company
in each Transferred Company is set forth on _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure
Letter_. All of the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares have been validly
authorized and issued, are fully paid and, in respect of such jurisdictions
where such concept is applicable, nonassessable and have not been issued in

there is no security, option, warrant, right, call, subscription agreement,
commitment or understanding of any nature whatsoever to which a Seller or a
Transferred Company is a party, that directly or indirectly (a) calls for the
issuance, sale, pledge or other disposition of any shares of capital stock

 



      
 

 



 

or other equity interests of a Transferred Company or any securities
convertible into, or other rights to acquire, any shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of a Transferred Company, (b) obligates a Transferred
Company to participate in or make any capital contribution or future equity
investment in any Persons, (c) obligates a Transferred Company to grant, offer

party to, or otherwise bound by, any voting trust, proxy or other agreement,
restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or
disposition of any Shares or any Subsidiary Shares. None of the Transferred
Companies own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interests in any
Person, other than a Transferred Company. Following the consummation of the
Restructurings, the applicable Seller shall own the Shares to be sold by such
Seller free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances,
and the Sellers will transfer to Buyer at the Closing, good title to the
Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrances.

easement agreements) or to construct, install or maintain any material
improvements upon or in the vicinity of such lot, parcel or tract of land.

indemnity, undertaking or guarantee in relation to the U.K. Retirement Plan.

respects in compliance with, all material Permits (other than Permits required

required to conduct the Business in all material respects in the manner in
which it is conducted as of the date of this Agreement. All such material
Permits are in full force and effect, and no event has occurred and is

period. Since December 31, 2012 and prior to the date of this Agreement, no
customer or supplier listed on _Schedule 2.18 of the Disclosure Letter_ has

none of the Transferred Companies, or any director, officer, agent, employee
or other person acting on behalf of any Transferred Company, has violated any
provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K.
Bribery Act of 2010 or similar laws of any jurisdiction. Since the Lookback

that alleges that any of the Transferred Companies, or its representative, has

2.20 _Brokers_. Except for Lazard Freres and Co. LLC, whose fees and expenses
will be paid by Parent or one of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies), no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby based upon any agreements, written, oral or otherwise made by or on
behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies).

any products designed, manufactured, sold, leased, licensed, or delivered, or
any service provided by the Transferred Companies, whether incurred by reason
of any express or implied warranty (including any warranty of merchantability
or fitness), any doctrine of common law (tort, contract, or other), any other
Legal Requirement or otherwise, (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

no Governmental Authority has alleged that any product designed, manufactured,
sold, leased, licensed, or delivered by any Transferred Company is defective
or unsafe or fails to meet any product warranty or any standards promulgated
by any such Governmental Authority and no product designed, manufactured,
sold, leased, licensed, or delivered by any Transferred Company has been
recalled and (iii) no Transferred Company has received any written notice of
recall of any such product from any Governmental Authority. Except for normal
returns and allowances which, individually or in the aggregate, have not been,
and would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the Business, taken as
a whole, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) could result in any such Losses or recall.

 



 

The parties hereto agree as follows:

Transferred Companies a non-exclusive, non-assignable, fully paid-up, royalty-
free, worldwide license for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days
after the Closing Date to use the Seller Marks to distribute, sell and offer
for sale, products and services, including for the display of marketing,
promotional and advertising materials, business cards, stationery, packaging
materials, displays, signs, promotional materials and other similar materials
that include one or more of the Seller Marks (collectively, " _Supplies_ "),
_provided_ such Supplies (i) were included within the inventory of Business
Assets as of the Closing, (ii) are used solely in connection with the
promotion, marketing, advertising and sale of the Business products of the
type sold, and in a manner consistent with that used, prior to the Closing and
(iii) clearly indicate that (x) the Transferred Companies are not affiliated
with Parent or any of Parents Affiliates and (y) the inclusion of the Seller
Marks in the Supplies shall not be construed as an endorsement of any of the
Business products by Parent or any of Parents Affiliates. Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees against all Losses asserted
against or imposed upon them as a consequence of the use of the Seller Marks
by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) following
the Closing, except for any Losses asserted against or imposed upon them as a
consequence of any claim that the use of the Seller Marks infringes the rights
of any third Person.

 



 

(b) Buyer agrees to cause each Transferred Company whose name includes the
name "Rockwood" to, promptly following the Closing, and in any event within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the Closing Date, change its name such that
its name does not include the name "Rockwood."

 



 

4.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, (a) Parent will give prompt notice in writing to Buyer of (i) any
written notice or other written communication it receives from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that the Consent or Approval
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents, or (iii) any
specific event or circumstance of which it has Knowledge, or of which it
receives written notice, that (x) has had or could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, taken together with other events or
circumstances, a Material Adverse Effect or (y) will result, or has a
reasonable prospect of resulting, in the failure to satisfy a condition
specified in Article V by the Outside Date, and (b) Buyer will give prompt
notice in writing to Parent of (i) any written notice or other written
communication it receives from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
Legal Requirements, (ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that the
Consent or Approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents, or (iii) any specific event or circumstance of which it has
knowledge, or of which it receives notice, that will result, or has a
reasonable prospect of resulting, in the failure to satisfy a condition
specified in Article VI by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice by Parent and the information or knowledge obtained by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall not (i) affect or be deemed to affect
or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Closing in Articles V and VI or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies of Buyer hereunder, including pursuant to Article VII, (ii) be deemed
to affect or modify Buyers reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by Seller in this Agreement or (iii) be deemed
to amend or supplement the Disclosure Letter or prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by Parent.

 



 

4.8 _Retention of Books and Records_. Buyer will retain, or cause its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) to retain, all books, records
and other documents pertaining to the Business in existence on the Closing
Date and to make the same available after the Closing Date for examination and
copying by Parent or its representatives, at Parents expense, upon reasonable
notice and subject to entry into customary confidentiality obligations. Buyer
agrees that no such books, records or documents will be destroyed by Buyer or
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) until the later of (i)
seven (7) years following the Closing or (ii) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the assessment of Taxes in the jurisdiction to which such
books, records and documents relate, and that thereafter no such books,
records or documents will be destroyed without first advising Parent in
writing and providing to Parent a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
or make copies thereof at Parents expense.

 



 

4.9 _Permits_. Buyer shall be responsible for effecting all updates and
amendments and reissuances of Permits required in connection with or as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in effecting such updates,
amendments and reissuances.

 



 

4.10 _Intercompany Agreements_.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing, all Business Agreements and transactions between Parent
and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) on the one hand, and

 



      
 

 



 

the Transferred Companies, on the other hand(other than the Business
Agreements or other transactions listed on _Schedule 4.10 of the Disclosure
Letter_ ) will either be terminated or amended to remove or replace the
applicable Transferred Company or Affiliate of Parent, as the case may be, as
a party to such agreement, as applicable, without further liability to any
Transferred Company that is a party thereto with respect to periods following
the Closing.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the other Sellers
and the Transferred Companies) to take such actions as are necessary to ensure
that the Retained Cash Balances do not exceed U.S.$10.0 million at Closing;
_provided_ that any amounts deemed to be Retained Cash Balances pursuant to
Section 4.22 shall not be Retained Cash Balances for these purposes.

 



 

4.11 _Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing, except for any Indebtedness arising
under any Enterprise Agreement, Parent will cause each Transferred Company to
pay, discharge, compromise, settle, terminate or otherwise satisfy (or cause
to be paid, discharged, compromised, settled, terminated, contributed to the
capital of the applicable Transferred Company or otherwise satisfied) in full
all Indebtedness of the Transferred Companies, including any intercompany
Indebtedness owing from any Transferred Company to Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) and all Indebtedness listed
on _Schedule 2.5(b) of the Disclosure Letter_. In addition, Parent will cause
all intercompany Indebtedness owing from Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Companies) to the Transferred Companies to be
paid, discharged, compromised, settled, terminated, contributed to the capital
of Parent or the applicable Affiliate or otherwise satisfied in full prior to
the Closing.

 



 

4.12 _Guarantees_. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, on or before the Closing Date, and in any event within ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date, the release of each of the obligations of
Parent (or any Affiliate thereof, other than the Transferred Companies) to
guaranty the liabilities listed on _Schedule 4.12 of the Disclosure Letter_ ,
and Buyer shall provide such guarantees as shall be reasonably required to
obtain such release. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent in respect
of any liability or expense incurred by Parent (or any Affiliate thereof,
other than the Transferred Companies) in respect of any claim made in respect
of any such liability or expense arising or incurred after the Closing Date.

 



 

4.13 _Title Insurance_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will cause the
Transferred Companies to reasonably cooperate with Buyer in Buyers efforts to
obtain title insurance or title reports in respect of the Real Property
located in the United States. Such cooperation will include the execution of
such customary instruments by Parent reasonably requested by Buyers title
insurance company to enable Buyer to obtain such insurance and desired
endorsements; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Companies) shall not be required to execute any
instrument which expands in any way the representations and warranties
contained herein or the liabilities of Parent hereunder (for purposes of this
Agreement, any instrument executed by the Transferred Companies pursuant to
this Section 4.13 shall be deemed to have been executed and delivered
following the Closing). The premiums for such title insurance will be Buyers
responsibility.

 



      
 

 



 

4.14 _Restructurings_. Parent shall cause the Restructurings to be consummated
in accordance with _Schedule A-2 of the Disclosure Letter_ and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Restructurings prior to the
date the Closing would otherwise be required to occur pursuant to this
Agreement without giving effect to the conditions to the consummation of the
Closing set forth in Sections 5.5 and 6.4. All fees, expenses and other
liabilities, other than Taxes (liability for which Buyer is indemnified for to
the extent provided in Section 9.1(a)(iii)), in connection with the
Restructurings shall be Parents responsibility.

 



 

4.15 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees, to the maximum extent not violative of applicable Legal
Requirements, that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date,
Parent will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any Business Employee who is or has
been employed by any of the Transferred Companies, at, or at any time within
one (1) year prior to, the time of the act of solicitation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) general solicitations, such as through newspaper
advertisements not directed at Business Employees, will not be deemed to
violate this Section 4.15(a) and (ii) this Section 4.15(a) shall not apply in
respect of any Business Employee whose employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including the Transferred Companies, is terminated by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees, to the maximum extent not violative of applicable Legal
Requirements, that for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date,
Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, engage in the
Business in any country (the " _Restricted Territory_ ") in which the Business
conducts operations as of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Business_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent
Parent or its Affiliates from (w) acquiring or owning, directly or indirectly,
up to 5% of a class of equity securities issued by any Person that engages,
directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory
that is publicly traded or listed on any stock exchange or automated quotation
system, (x) conducting any business conducted by them on the Closing Date
(other than those conducted through the Transferred Companies), (y) acquiring
any Entity or business or owning such acquired Entity or business that,
directly or indirectly, engages in the Restricted Business in the Restricted
Territory; _provided_ , _however_ , that if more than 15% of the aggregate net
revenue derived from the last complete fiscal year of such acquired Entity or
business (calculated on a consolidated basis) was attributed to the Restricted
Business in the Restricted Territory, Parent will or will cause its applicable
Affiliate to, as the case may be, use commercially reasonable efforts to
dispose of such portion of such Entity or business to the extent that it
engages in the Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory within nine (9)
months of the consummation of such acquisition by Parent or such Affiliate, or
(z) performing its obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the restrictions set
forth in Sections 4.15(a) and 4.15(b) will apply only to Rockwood and Entities
"controlled by" (as such term is defined in the definition of the term "
_Affiliate_ ") Rockwood, and shall not apply to any third Person or the
Affiliates of such third Person (other than Rockwood, and any Entities
"controlled" by Rockwood) that acquires Rockwood or any Entities "controlled"
by

 



      
 

 



 

Rockwood, whether as a result of a merger, consolidation, other business
combination, or acquisition of all or substantially all of its assets or
business.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this
Section 4.15 are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all
other respects, and any violation of these restrictions would cause
substantial injury to Buyer and that Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement without receiving the additional consideration offered by Parent in
binding itself and its Affiliates to these restrictions. In the event of a
breach or a threatened breach by Parent or any of its Affiliates of these
restrictions, Buyer will be entitled to seek an injunction restraining Parent
or such Affiliate from such breach or threatened breach without the necessity
of proving the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages; _provided_ , _however_
, that the right to injunctive relief will not be construed as prohibiting
Buyer from pursuing any other available remedies, whether at law or in equity,
for such breach or threatened breach.

 



 

(e) If any court determines that any provision included in this Section 4.15
is unenforceable, such court will have the power to reduce the duration or
scope of such provision, as the case may be, or terminate such provision and,
in reduced form, such provision shall be enforceable; it is the intention of
the parties hereto that the foregoing restrictions shall not be terminated,
unless so terminated by a court, but shall be deemed amended to the extent
required to render them valid and enforceable, such amendment to apply only
with respect to the operation of this Agreement in the jurisdiction of the
court that has made the adjudication.

 



 

4.16 _Cooperation in Litigation_. Buyer and Parent shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with each other at the
requesting partys expense in the prosecution or defense of any claim,
litigation or other proceeding arising from or related to the conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing and involving one or more third Persons. The
party requesting such cooperation shall pay the reasonable out of pocket
expenses incurred in providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal
fees and disbursements) by the party providing such cooperation and by its
Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees and agents, but
shall not be responsible for reimbursing such party or its Affiliates or its
and their officers, directors, employees and agents for their time spent in
such cooperation.

 



 

4.17 _Assistance Obligations of Buyer_. After the Closing, Buyer will (and
will cause the Transferred Companies and its other Affiliates to) reasonably
assist Parent and its Affiliates in preparing information for various
Governmental Authorities or third party insurance providers under policies
held by Parent or its Affiliates after the Closing to the extent that such
information relates to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Business, the Business Assets and/or the liabilities of the Business. Such
information includes, but is not limited to, information required by Parent
and its Affiliates to (i) comply with their financial reporting requirements
and (ii) to submit any claims that would reasonably be expected to be covered
under the insurance policies of Parent or its Affiliates or their respective
self-insurance programs in respect of events, circumstances and occurrences
prior to Closing. Parent shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (excluding internal costs) actually

 



      
 

 



 

incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the compliance by
Parent with its obligations under this Section 4.17.

 



 

4.18 _Further Assurances_. Any time after the Closing, Parent and Buyer will,
and Buyer will cause the Transferred Companies to, promptly execute,
acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents reasonably requested
by Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, to satisfy or in connection with its
obligations hereunder or to consummate or implement the transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.19 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the Transferred Companies
shall cease to be insured by Parents or Parents Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) insurance policies or by any of Parents or Parents
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) self-insured programs.
From and after the Closing, Parent shall be responsible for the administration
and payment of all claims made by any of the Transferred Companies prior to
the Closing under any of Parents or Parents Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) insurance policies or self-insured programs, and Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) shall reasonably
cooperate with any reasonable requests of Parent in connection with
administration and payment of such claims. For the avoidance of doubt,
following the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall retain all rights to
control its insurance policies and programs, including the right to exhaust,
settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect
to any of its insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding whether any
such policies or programs apply to any liabilities of Buyer or the Transferred
Companies. Prior to and after the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing Date, the Transferred Companies) shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to assist Buyer in obtaining replacement
insurance policies.

 



 

4.20 _Privileged Matters; Waiver of Conflicts_. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the information relating to or arising out of the legal advice
or services that have been or will be provided prior to the Closing Date for
the benefit of both Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies) and the Transferred Companies shall be subject to a shared
privilege between Parent, on the one hand, and the Transferred Companies, on
the other hand, and Parent and the Transferred Companies shall have equal
right to assert all such shared privileges in connection with privileged
information under any applicable Legal Requirements and no such shared
privilege may be waived by (a) Parent without the prior written consent of
Buyer or (b) by Buyer or any Transferred Company without the prior written
consent of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information relating to
or arising out of any legal advice or services provided, whether before or
after the Closing Date, with respect to any matter for which an Indemnifying
Party has an indemnification obligation hereunder, shall be subject to the
sole and separate privilege of such Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to control the assertion or waiver of all such
separate privileges under any applicable Legal Requirements in connection with
any privileged information, whether or not such information is in the
possession of or under the control of any Indemnified Party. Buyer, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the
Transferred Companies, hereby irrevocably waives any conflicts arising out of
the representation of the Transferred Companies by Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP
or Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP prior to the Closing that may, following the
Closing, prevent such firms from representing Parent and its Affiliates in any
matter

 



      
 

 



 

(including with respect to claims and legal proceedings arising under or with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

4.21 _Post-Closing Confidentiality_. For five (5) years following the Closing,
Parent shall keep confidential, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their representatives to keep confidential, all information relating to the
Business, the Transferred Companies and the Business Assets (" _Confidential
Information_ "), except (a) with the prior written consent of Buyer, (b) to
the extent necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements, including
federal securities laws, the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction
or any judicial or administrative process, in which event, to the extent
permitted by such Legal Requirement, order or process, Parent shall notify
Buyer as promptly as practicable (and, if possible, prior to the making of
such disclosure) and disclose only that information that Parent determines
(with the advice of counsel) is required by such applicable Legal Requirements
to be disclosed, (c) to the extent such Confidential Information is available
to the public through no fault of the Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, (d)
to the extent such Confidential Information was or becomes available to Parent
or any Affiliate of Parent from a third Person who is under no confidential or
fiduciary obligation to Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to such
Confidential Information, (e) to the extent such Confidential Information is
independently developed by Parent or its Affiliates without violating this
Section 4.21 or (f) to the extent such Confidential Information is used in the
enforcement of any of the rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents or in the defense of any action,
suit, litigation, investigation or proceeding brought against Parent or one of
its Affiliates.

 



 

4.22 _Enterprise Agreements_

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause the Enterprise Agreements to be terminated by RSGG with
effect as near to (but not after) the Closing Date as is reasonably
practicable (the effective date of such termination, the " _Termination Date_
"). Within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause Rockwood Clay Additives to prepare and complete, in cooperation with
RSGG, the annual financial accounts of Rockwood Clay Additives for the fiscal
period commencing on January 1 of the calendar year during which the
Termination Date occurs and ending as of the Termination Date (the " _German
Controlled Entity Profit Pooling Accounts_ "), which accounts shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
Germany as in effect on the Termination Date and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, consistent with the past practices of Rockwood
Clay Additives, including by applying the policies, procedures, practices and
elections applied by Parent in the preparation of the annual financial
accounts of Rockwood Clay Additives prior to the Closing Date on a consistent
basis. Any amounts included in the German Controlled Entity Profit Pooling
Accounts as payable by RSGG to Rockwood Clay Additives as of the Termination
Date under an Enterprise Agreement shall be treated as Retained Cash Balances
for purposes of determining the Purchase Price, and such amount shall be
included in the Retained Cash Balances included in the Final Closing Statement
delivered by Buyer to Parent pursuant to Section 1.5(c), and any disputes over
such amount shall be resolved pursuant to Section 1.5. Any amounts included in
the German Controlled Entity Profit Pooling Accounts as payable by Rockwood
Clay Additives to RSGG under an Enterprise Agreement as of the Termination
Date shall be treated as Transferred Company Indebtedness for purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

determining the Purchase Price, and such amount shall be included in the
Transferred Company Indebtedness included in the Final Closing Statement
delivered by Buyer to Parent pursuant to Section 1.5(c), and any disputes over
such amount shall be resolved pursuant to Section 1.5. Promptly, and in any
event, within two (2) Business Days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5, (i) Buyer shall cause Rockwood Clay
Additives to pay to RSGG any amounts payable to RSGG under the Enterprise
Agreements as of the Termination Date, and (ii) Parent shall cause RSGG to pay
to Rockwood Clay Additives any amounts payable to Rockwood Clay Additives
under the Enterprise Agreements as of the Termination Date.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including Rockwood Clay Additives) not to, amend, re-file or
otherwise modify the German Controlled Entity Profit Pooling Accounts without
the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). Upon Parents reasonable request, Buyer shall, and shall
cause Rockwood Clay Additives to, amend the German Controlled Entity Profit
Pooling Accounts in accordance with the written instructions of Parent, if and
to the extent required in order to maintain the fiscal unity of Rockwood Clay
Additives with RSGG and its Affiliates in accordance with the applicable
Enterprise Agreement for any period ending on or prior to the Termination
Date. In the event that, following the Closing Date, a Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction makes a determination which is not subject to appeal
that the amount of profits transferred or the losses paid, as the case may be,
under an Enterprise Agreement with respect to any period ending on or prior to
the Termination Date were not transferred or paid, as the case may be, in
accordance with the applicable Enterprise Agreement or applicable Legal
Requirements, (i) Parent will cause RSGG to pay any such amounts so determined
to be payable by RSGG to Rockwood Clay Additives, or (ii) Buyer shall cause
Rockwood Clay Additives to pay such amounts so determined to be payable by
Rockwood Clay Additives to RSGG, as the case may be, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by Parent
or Buyer, as the case may be, to the other party. Concurrently with any
payment by RSGG to Rockwood Clay Additives pursuant to the previous sentence,
Buyer shall pay to Parent an amount equal to such payment and, concurrently
with any payment by Rockwood Clay Additives to RSGG, as the case may be,
pursuant to the previous sentence, Parent shall pay to the Buyer an amount
equal to such payment, in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account designated in writing by Parent or Buyer, as the case
may be, to the other party.

 



 

4.23 _Parent Release_. Except (a) for the rights and remedies in respect of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, (b) with regard to those items
listed on _Schedule 4.10 of the Disclosure Letter_ or (c), with respect to any
director, officer or employee of a Transferred Company, for any breaches or
violations of the Rockwood Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or similar
policies, effective upon the Closing, Parent, on behalf of itself and each of
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies), hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases, discharges and covenants not to sue and otherwise
agrees not to enforce any claim, cause of action, right, title or interest
against, any Transferred Company and each director, officer and employee of
each Transferred Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns
of, from and with respect to any and all claims, charges, complaints, debts,
covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, actions or demands of any
kind or character,

 



      
 

 



 

based upon any fact or circumstance, whether known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, which presently exists or has ever existed in the past, that
Parent or such of its Affiliates have or may have in any manner whatsoever,
either singly or jointly with others against any of such Persons.

 



 

4.24 _ECC America Agreement_. Following the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing Date, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent to assign in part the ECC America Agreement to Buyer or one
if its Affiliates from the counterparties to such agreement; _provided_ that
such efforts shall not include an obligation by Parent or any of its
Affiliates to pay any consideration or other amounts to any third Person in
connection with obtaining such consent. In the event the ECC America Agreement
is not assigned in part to Buyer or one of its Affiliates at the Closing,
following the Closing and until the ECC America Agreement is assigned in part
to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, Parent shall, at the cost and expense of
Buyer and its Affiliates, use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide,
and shall cause its Affiliates to use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to provide, Buyer and its Affiliates, including Southern Clay
Products, the benefits under the ECC America Agreement to which Buyer and its
Affiliates, including Southern Clay Products, are entitled, including using
its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any claims for indemnification
available to Buyer and its Affiliates, including Southern Clay Products, under
the ECC America Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. Buyer agrees
to provide, and to cause its Affiliates, including Southern Clay Products, to
provide, such cooperation and information reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with such indemnification claims.

 



 

4.25 _UK Pensions_. Parent will use reasonable efforts to reach an agreement
with the trustees of the U.K. Retirement Plan prior to the Closing under which
any and all liabilities of Rockwood Additives Limited in relation to the U.K.
Retirement Plan are apportioned to Parent or any of its Affiliates other than
the Transferred Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Rockwood
Additives Limited, Buyer or any of their Affiliates following the Closing are
or may become required to pay any amount to or in respect of the U.K.
Retirement Plan (whether under section 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995 or
otherwise), Parent acknowledges that the relevant provisions of Section 8.2 of
this Agreement shall apply.

 



 

4.26 _Post-Closing Asset Transfers_. If after the Closing, either Buyer or
Parent in good faith identifies any Asset (other than any Administrative
Asset) of Parent or its Affiliates which is primarily used or held for use
primarily in the operation of the Business as the Business is conducted as of
the date of the Agreement that is not owned by a Transferred Company at the
Closing, then either Buyer or Parent, as applicable, will provide written
notice to the other Party identifying such Asset, then Parent will, or will
cause its Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable and at no further cost to
Buyer, transfer, convey, assign, deliver, or cause to be transferred,
conveyed, assigned, or delivered to Buyer, all of the right, title and
interest of Parent and its Affiliates in and to such Asset.

ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to consummate the transactions contemplated

have been obtained (and, to the extent relevant, shall remain in full force
and effect).

 



 

6.3 _No Injunctions or Restraints_. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction, or other similar legal restraint or
prohibition, shall have been issued by a Governmental Authority, and shall

Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose
failure (or whose Affiliates failure) to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such order,

this Section 7.2, Section 9.1(h) and Section 10.1 and the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 2.20 and 3.4, which will survive any
termination of this Agreement, this Agreement will forthwith become null and
void, and no party hereto or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, consultants, stockholders or principals will have any
liability hereunder or with respect hereto, except that nothing contained
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any failure to comply with

from or arising out of a breach or inaccuracy of such a representation and
warranty or under such rights of indemnification is made with reasonable

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent

as of such date or time);

 



 

(b) any breach by Parent of or failure by Parent to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

arising out of:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer

as of such date or time);

 



 

(b) any breach by Buyer of or failure by Buyer to perform any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement; and

8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement and except in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct:

 



 

(a) the aggregate liability of Parent and Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2 (other
than Sections 8.2(d) or (e)) or Section 8.3, as the case may be, will not
exceed the Purchase Price (excluding Retained Cash Balances and Transferred
Company Indebtedness), except that the aggregate liability of Parent (i)
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (other than in respect of any inaccuracy or breach
of the Specified Representations or the representations and warranties set

Retained Cash Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness) and (ii) pursuant
to Section 8.2(k) shall not exceed U.S.$20.0 million;

 



 

(b) no Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover indirect, special,
consequential, incidental, punitive or business interruption damages, or lost
revenues, profits, cost savings or synergies pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 8.3,
except to the extent such Losses were (i) other than in the case of punitive
or special damages, reasonably foreseeable or (ii) actually paid to a third
Person (including pursuant to a binding contractual obligation) pursuant to a
final, non-appealable award, decree or settlement in any Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(c) no claim for indemnification may be made by a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 8.2 or by a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8.3 unless written
notice of such claim (describing the facts or events, the existence or
occurrence of which constitute or have resulted in the alleged inaccuracy or
breach of a representation or warranty made in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or which otherwise form the basis of the claim with reasonable
specificity, to the extent known) has been given to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") during the relevant
survival period set forth in Section 8.1 (which, for purposes of Sections
8.2(a) and 8.3(a), will be the survival period of the representation and
warranty alleged to have been breached);

 



 

(d) Parent shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a): (i) for any
Losses with respect to an individual matter or series of related matters until
the cumulative aggregate amount of the Losses with respect to such matter or
series of related matters arising out of the same facts or circumstances
exceeds U.S.$150,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the amount of
all such Losses (including those that are less than the Threshold Amount)
shall be included for purposes of computing the Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder and/or applicable against the Basket Amount pursuant to clause (ii)
below; and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Losses of the Buyer
Indemnitees for which indemnification would otherwise be available under
Section 8.2(a) exceeds 0.5 % of the Purchase Price (excluding Retained Cash
Balances and Transferred Company Indebtedness) (the " _Basket Amount_ "),
after which Parent will be obligated to indemnify for only that portion of
such Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees that exceed the Basket Amount; _provided_
that the limitations set forth in subclause (ii) of this clause (d) shall not
apply to Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee by reason of any inaccuracy or
breach of a Specified Representation; and

 



 

(e) Parent shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2 for any Loss to the
extent a reserve with respect to such Loss is included in or taken into
account in the calculation or determination of Closing Working Capital, Capex
Shortfall or Transferred Company Indebtedness.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parents
obligations under Section 8.2(a) in respect of any asserted breach or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.14
shall, to the extent such obligations involve a Remedial Action, be limited to
the minimum reasonable cost approach to such Remedial Action, taking into
account Buyers or its successors continued industrial use of the relevant
property or facility, that is legally available (or otherwise required by any
Governmental Authority).

 



 

(g) Parent shall have no liability for Losses relating to any Environmental
Condition (i) under Section 8.2(a)-(j) to the extent occurring as a result of
or triggered by the closure, decommissioning or demolition after the Closing
of any part of any facility or structure of any Transferred Company or (ii)
under Section 8.2 to the extent occurring as a result of or triggered by any
sampling, monitoring, testing, or surface or subsurface investigation
conducted after the Closing that is not (A) expressly required pursuant to an
Environmental Requirement of any Governmental Authority (except where the
Governmental Authority has requested such Remedial Action by reason of a
request initiated by a Buyer or its Affiliates or its or their
representatives) or (B) otherwise the reasonable action of a prudent
businessperson taken for a reason other than the assertion of an indemnity
claim under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) For purposes of Section 8.2, Losses shall not include (i) any Losses
arising from any change to a non-industrial use of the Real Property, (ii) any
Losses resulting from any increase, worsening or other adverse impact on any
Environmental Condition that arises from any act or omission attributable to
Buyer or any Transferred Company (and their Affiliates, agents and contractors
and Persons acting on their behalf) following the Closing that is a failure to
act reasonably with respect to an Environmental Condition, and (iii) any
expense related to management or employee time (whether opportunity costs,
direct costs or otherwise).

 



 

(i) For the purposes of determining whether a breach of representation or
warranty has occurred for the purposes of Section 8.2(a) or 8.3(a), as the
case may be, and calculating the amount of Losses related thereto, any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in
Articles II and III shall be disregarded (it being understood that the word
"Material" in the defined term "Material Contract(s)" and the qualifications
as to "material", "material respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" contained
in Sections 2.4(a) (second sentence), 2.6(a)(ii), 2.11(c), 2.12(a), and 4.3(b)
(to the extent incorporated into Section 2.6(b)) shall not be disregarded for
any of such purposes).

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for the
qualification of the representations and warranties in Articles II and III by
the Disclosure Letter as expressly provided for in Section 10.10(b), the
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Parties after the Closing shall not be
limited by the fact that any Indemnified Party had actual or constructive
knowledge (regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained through such
Indemnified Partys own investigation or through disclosure by Parent, Buyer
or any third party, as applicable) of any breach, event or circumstance,
whether before or after the Closing.

 



 

(k) For purposes of Section 8.2(k):

 



 

(i) Parent shall have no liability for any Losses with respect to an
individual Environmental Condition or series of related Environmental
Conditions until the cumulative aggregate amount of the Losses with respect to
such Environmental Condition or series of related Environmental Conditions
arising out of the same facts or circumstances exceeds U.S.$50,000, after
which Parent will be obligated to indemnify for only that portion of such
Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees that exceed such amount;

 



 

(ii) Parent shall be liable only for (A) 75% of the Losses of the Buyer
Indemnitees incurred prior to and including the tenth (10th) anniversary of
the Closing Date and (B) 50% of the Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees incurred
after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to and
including the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) Parent shall not be liable for any Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees
incurred following the fifteenth (15h) anniversary of the Closing Date; and

 



 

(iv) Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under clauses
(d), (e), (g) or (j) of Sections 8.2 for any Pre-Closing Widnes Environmental
Condition.

 



       
 

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
Article VIII, Parent shall have no liability for any Losses incurred by the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon, resulting from or arising out of the
remediation, removal or disposal of any asbestos at the facility of the U.K.
Company in Widnes, Cheshire, United Kingdom identified in the surveys
described in _Schedule 2.14(g) of the Disclosure Letter_.

 



 

8.5 _Mitigation and Recovery from Third Persons_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Parent shall each take, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss for which
indemnification may be sought hereunder promptly upon a responsible officer of
an Indemnified Party or its Affiliates becoming aware of such Loss, and
neither Buyer nor Parent shall be liable for any Loss to the extent the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates could have mitigated such Loss by taking
reasonable steps after a responsible officer of such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates becomes aware thereof.

 



 

(b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII (before giving effect to the other limitations on indemnification
set forth in this Article VIII) shall be net of any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) under insurance policies, or
otherwise recovered by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) from
other Persons (in each case, net of any costs incurred for the recovery of
such amounts), with respect to such Loss. Buyer and Parent each agree that,
unless the other party shall otherwise direct in writing, it will (and cause
its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any such
amounts to the extent such recoveries would reduce amounts required to be paid
by the other party pursuant to this Article VIII; _provided_ that, no
Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) shall be required to seek
recovery of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article
VIII from any employees or managers of any Transferred Companies in order to
recover the full amount of the Loss.

 



 

8.6 _Procedure_. Any claim for indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section
8.3 will be made in accordance with this Section 8.6. In the case of any claim
for indemnification arising from a claim or demand of a third Person (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will give prompt written notice,
and in any event, no more than fifteen (15) Business Days following such
Indemnified Partys receipt of such claim or demand, to the Indemnifying Party
describing in reasonable detail the basis of such claim or demand as to which
it may request indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such notice need only specify such information to the knowledge of the
Indemnified Party as of the date of such notice and shall not limit or
prejudice any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party (including
pursuant to Section 8.1) on the basis of any such limitations on the
information included in such notice or any limitations made in good faith to
preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
privilege, _provided_ , _further_ that the failure to notify or delay in
notifying an Indemnifying Party as provided in this sentence or the next
sentence will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant
to Sections 8.2 or 8.3 above, as applicable, except to the extent that such
failure actually harms the Indemnifying Party (it being understood that any
claim for indemnity pursuant to Sections 8.2(a) or 8.3(a) above must be made
by notice given as provided in this sentence or the next sentence within the
applicable survival period

 



      
 

 



 

specified in Section 8.1 above). Any other claim for indemnification will be
made as promptly as practicable after the time the Indemnified Party becomes
aware of the facts forming the basis of such claim. The Indemnifying Party
will have the right, at its sole expense, to defend and to direct the defense
against and management and settlement of any such claim or demand, in its name
or in the name of the Indemnified Party, with counsel or other representatives
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party may not assume the
defense, management or settlement of any such claim if (i) such claim seeks
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or (ii) the
Indemnified Party has determined in good faith that Losses that may be
incurred as a result of such claim, either individually or when aggregated
with all other outstanding indemnification claims under this Article VIII,
would exceed the amount specified in Section 8.4(a). The Indemnifying Party
may not settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless the relief consists
solely of monetary Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party and includes as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person asserting such claim to
all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such claim. Each party will cooperate with the other party and make
available its officers and employees and relevant files and records (and those
of its Affiliates), and agrees to promptly provide such information as to the
defense of any such claim or demand as the other party shall reasonably
request. The Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any claim or demand with counsel of its choice
employed by it at the expense of the Indemnified Party and will have the
right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all cross-claims and
counterclaims it may have. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice of a
Third-Party Claim that it elects to undertake the defense thereof or is not
permitted or, shall fail to, defend, contest or otherwise protect against the
imposition of any such damages as to any such claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest or assert any
cross-claim or counterclaim or otherwise protect against such claim and may
make any compromise or settlement thereof and recover from and be indemnified
by the Indemnifying Party for the entire reasonable cost thereof, including
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel; _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party will have no indemnification obligations with respect to any such claim
or demand which is settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

8.7 _Further Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, except with respect to matters covered by Section
1.5, the rights of the parties under Sections 8.2 and 8.3 (and under Article
IX) will be the exclusive remedy of the parties (and the Transferred
Companies) with respect to any claims a party may have against the other party
or such other partys Affiliates under, relating to or in

 

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
except with respect to the matters covered by Section 1.5, or for the
obligations of Parent under Section 8.2 (and under Article IX), Parent shall
have no liability to Buyer or its Affiliates under, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.7 limits or modifies
any rights of either party to seek

 



      
 

 



 

specific performance or specific enforcement of, or other injunctive or
equitable relief in respect of, any express provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party will,
upon payment of such indemnity, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Party with respect to claims to which such indemnification relates.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) other than with
respect to the survival of the representations or warranties set forth in
Section 2.7, this Article VIII shall have no application with respect to
indemnification for Taxes, which shall otherwise be covered exclusively by
Sections 9.1 and 9.2 and (ii) nothing in this Article VIII shall limit the
rights or remedies of any Person under this Agreement based upon or in
connection with fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

 



 

8.8 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Any indemnification payment made pursuant to
this Article VIII shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

 _ARTICLE IX_

 



 

 _TAX AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS_

 



 

9.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) (i) To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, at the
request of Parent, Buyer shall cooperate with Parent in making any elections
or taking any other actions that will result in any taxable periods of the
Transferred Companies that begin prior to the Closing Date ending on or prior
to the Closing Date. Parent, Buyer and their Affiliates shall cooperate and
shall make such elections and take such other actions necessary to terminate
the Tax year of the U.K. Company as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) Parent will cause to be prepared and filed all Income Tax Returns
(including any consolidated, unitary or combined Income Tax Returns) required
to be filed with respect to any Transferred Company for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date (any such period, a " _Pre-Closing
Period_ "). Parent shall cause to be delivered to Buyer drafts of any such
material Income Tax Returns (other than any Income Tax Returns filed by a
combined, unitary or consolidated group with respect to which a Transferred
Company is not the parent) at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
due date for filing such Income Tax Return for Buyers review and comment
(which Parent shall not be obligated to accept) within five (5) Business Days
after receipt of the drafts from Parent. Parent will include (or cause to be
included) the income of Southern Clay Products in the consolidated federal
Income Tax Returns filed by Rockwood for all taxable years ending on or before
the Closing Date. Buyer will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns
other than Income Tax Returns (any such Tax Returns, " _Non-Income Tax
Returns_ ") required to be filed with respect to any Transferred Company for
any Pre-Closing Period that are due after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_
, that (A) drafts of any such Non-Income Tax Returns (other than monthly
returns for

 



      
 

 



 

VAT, wage tax and social security) shall be provided to Parent for its review
and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to filing and the parties will use
all reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute with respect to such Non-Income
Tax Returns, but if such dispute cannot be resolved by the parties within
fifteen (15) days after Buyer receives notice of such dispute, it shall be
referred to the Selected Accountants, (B) such Non-Income Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements and (C) Parent may assume
responsibility for preparing and filing any such Non-Income Tax Returns (other
than monthly returns for VAT, wage tax and social security) upon notice to
Buyer at least thirty (30) days before any such Non-Income Tax Return is due.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) shall amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period
without Parents consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

(iii) Parent will pay, and will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, Taxes imposed upon or
incurred by any Transferred Company (A) for any Pre-Closing Period or that
relate to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period as a result
of the Restructurings or the satisfaction of the Transferred Companies
Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.11) or (B) that result from (I) a breach of
a representation or warranty in Section 2.7(f), (g), (h), (k), (l), (m), or
(n) or a covenant in Section 4.3, (II) secondary liabilities for Taxes under
Treasury Regulation § 1502-6 or any comparable provision of state, local or
non-U.S. law or of any Transferred Companies having been, on or before the
Closing Date, a member of a consolidated, combined or affiliated group for Tax
purposes or (III) payment of the Transaction Bonuses described in Section
9.3(h), except in the case of (A) and (B) above, to the extent that the
liability for such Taxes was included in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax
Basis, any Taxes imposed as a result of (A) any action outside the ordinary
course of business effected by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Transferred Companies) on the Closing Date, (B) any Tax election
made by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies), except for any such election directed by Parent or required
pursuant to this Agreement, or (C) the breach by Buyer of any of its covenants
hereunder. To the extent that the accrued liability with respect to any such
Taxes in the calculation of Closing Working Capital exceeds the actual
liability, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to pay such excess to
Parent within fifteen (15) days after filing the relevant Tax Return for such
Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 9.1(a)(iii), Parent shall have no
liability pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(iii) for any Tax to the extent a
reserve for such Tax is included or taken into account in the calculation or
determination of Transferred Company Indebtedness.

 



 

(b) (i) (A) Buyer will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required
to be filed by or on behalf of any Transferred Company for any taxable period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (any such period, a "
_Straddle Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that drafts of any such Tax
Return (other than a monthly return for VAT, wage tax and social security)
shall be provided to Parent for its review and comment at least thirty (30)
days prior to filing, and such Tax Returns shall be subject to Parents review
and

 



      
 

 



 

approval. To the extent that any dispute with respect to the preparation of a
Straddle Period Tax Return cannot be resolved by the parties at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date of the Tax Return, it shall be referred to the
Selected Accountants for resolution. Except as otherwise consented to by
Parent or as required by applicable Legal Requirements, any such Tax Returns
will be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices of the Transferred
Companies.

 



 

(ii) In the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes in the nature of
property Taxes, be deemed to be equal to the amount of such Tax for the entire
tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and
(B) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes in the nature of property Taxes,
be equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended
on the Closing Date assuming a deemed closing of the books, except that
exemptions, allowances and deductions (such as depreciation deductions)
calculated on an annual basis shall be prorated between the portion of the
applicable Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date and the portion after
the Closing Date on a per diem basis.

 



 

(iii) Subject to Section 9.1(a)(iii), Buyer shall reimburse Parent, and will
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates from and against, on a
Net After-Tax Basis from any Taxes imposed upon Parent or its Affiliates for
any Taxes, attributable to the Post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period,
except to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of any breach by
Parent of any of its covenants hereunder. Any Taxes (including estimated
Taxes) paid by the Transferred Companies with respect to any Straddle Period
prior to the Closing shall be credited against Parents liability pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)(iii). Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Transferred Companies) shall amend any Tax Return for a
Straddle Period without Parents written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(c) Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, any
Taxes of the Transferred Companies for taxable periods beginning after the
Closing Date, except to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of
the breach by Parent of any of its covenants under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Parent or, respectively, Buyer will be entitled to retain, or receive
prompt payment from Buyer or, respectively, Parent of, to the extent not
included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, any refund or credit
for overpayment of Taxes for which Parent or, respectively, Buyer (including
by way of offset) is responsible pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or (b) plus any
interest received with respect thereto from the relevant taxing authorities.
Buyer will, if Parent so reasonably requests in good faith and at Parents
expense, cause the Transferred Companies to promptly file for and obtain any
refunds or credits to which Parent is entitled under this Section 9.1(d);
provided that such claim for refund or credit would not reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on Buyer after the Closing Date. Buyer will
permit Parent to control (at Parents expense) the prosecution of any such
claim for refund

 



      
 

 



 

and, when deemed appropriate by Parent, will cause the relevant Entity to
authorize by appropriate power of attorney such person as Parent may designate
to represent such Entity with respect to such refund claimed. For purposes of
this Section 9.1(d), a party will be deemed to have made prompt payment of a
refund or credit if such payment is made within ten (15) days of the receipt
by such party of such refund or of the use by such party of such credit.

 



 

(e) If and to the extent that any audit or other adjustment to a Tax Return
filed by or on behalf of a Transferred Company for a Pre-Closing Period
results not only in an increase in Tax liability for which Parent is
responsible pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or (b) (including, without limitation,
any liability with respect to a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax) but
also in a corresponding Tax benefit to Buyer (or any of its Affiliates,
including the Transferred Companies) for any taxable period or portion thereof
following the Closing (including, without limitation, as a result of income
having been accelerated from a period following the Closing to a Pre-Closing
period, deductions or credits being deferred from a Pre-Closing Period to a
period following the Closing, or increased depreciation or amortization
deductions being allowed following the Closing), within thirty (30) days
following such adjustment, Buyer shall pay over to Parent an amount equal to
the net present value of any such corresponding Tax benefit (less any related
costs) to Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) up to, but not in excess of, the
corresponding Tax liability, it being understood that the net present value of
a Tax benefit shall be calculated based on the relevant applicable Tax rate
and using a 5.5% annual discount rate.

 



 

(f) Buyer will promptly notify Parent in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) of
notice of any pending or threatened audit or assessment with respect to Taxes
for which Parent would be required to pay or indemnify Buyer or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or (b) (each an " _Indemnifiable Tax
Claim_ "); provided that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Parent
of its obligations under Sections 9.1(a) or (b), except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that Parent is actually prejudiced thereby. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall have thirty
(30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control,
through counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer at the expense of Parent, of
the defense of the Indemnifiable Tax Claim, and Buyer shall cooperate with
Parent in connection therewith; provided that Parent shall not, except with
the consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), compromise or settle any such proceeding, or provide
any consents or waivers to extend applicable statutes of limitations. If
Parent shall assume the conduct and control of any Indemnifiable Tax Claim,
Parent shall permit Buyer to participate, at Buyers own expense, in such
defense (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by permitting reasonable
opportunity for Buyer to review and comment upon any proposed representations
to be made, or caused to be made, by Parent in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax
Claim) through counsel chosen by Buyer (and the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by Buyer). So long as Parent is reasonably so
contesting the Indemnifiable Tax Claim in good faith, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit any Transferred Company to, pay or settle the Indemnifiable
Tax Claim; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the
right to pay or settle, or cause to be paid or settled, the Indemnifiable Tax
Claim if Buyer waives its right to indemnification with respect to such
Indemnifiable Tax Claim and Parent shall have consented to such payment or
settlement (such

 



      
 

 



 

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Parent
does not notify Buyer within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Buyers
notice of an Indemnifiable Tax Claim that it elects to undertake the defense
thereof, Buyer shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
Indemnifiable Tax Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement, and Buyer shall be entitled to
reimbursement of any reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney fees and disbursements of counsel) with respect thereto. Buyer and
Parent shall, at their own expense, jointly control any audit, examination,
administrative or court proceeding in respect of Taxes related to any Straddle
Period.

 



 

(g) After the Closing Date, each of Buyer and Parent will (at its own expense)
provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the
other party in connection with the preparation of any return, report, or form
with respect to Taxes or any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
(such assistance to include assistance in data collection and responses to
information requests) relating to liability for Taxes of the Transferred
Companies or any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group in which
any of the Transferred Companies is included.

 



 

(h) Buyer will be responsible for payment of, and will indemnify and hold
Parent and its Affiliates harmless from and against all documentary, stamp,
transfer, sales, use, excise and similar Taxes imposed upon Parent or Buyer or
their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall be responsible for
any Taxes arising in connection with the Restructurings. Buyer will be
responsible for preparing and timely filing any forms required with respect to
any such Taxes. Promptly following the filing of each such return, Buyer will
provide to Parent a true copy of such return as filed and evidence of the
timely filing thereof and a receipt showing payment of any Taxes owed.

 



 

(i) Subject to Section 4.22, any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between
or among Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies), on the one hand, and the Transferred Companies, on the other hand,
shall be terminated or cancelled, and Parent and its Affiliates shall take
such additional steps as may be required so that, in each case, as of the
Closing Date any such agreement or arrangement shall have no further effect
for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year or a past year),
and after the Closing Date none of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than
Transferred Companies) shall make any claim against any Transferred Company in
respect of such an agreement or arrangement.

 



 

(j) Any amount paid by or on behalf of any party to or on behalf of another
party pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(k) Parent shall be subrogated to any rights (including rights to
indemnification) that Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) may have against third parties (other than employees and managers
of the Transferred Companies) with respect to Taxes paid or indemnified by
Parent pursuant to this Section 9.1, so long as such rights are exercised in a
commercially reasonable manner.

 



      
 

 



 

(l) The indemnification obligations in this Section 9.1 shall survive until
the date that is (x) thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations in the case of any Taxes other than German
Taxes, and (y) six (6) months after the Tax assessment becomes binding and
unappealable ( _formell und materiell bestandskraftige_ ) in the case of
German Taxes.

 



 

9.2 _Certain VAT Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Parent are of the opinion that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not subject to VAT and Buyer and Parent agree not to take,
or cause to be taken, any action that could reasonably be expected to cause
VAT to become due. Parent shall, and shall procure that the other Sellers
undertake, not to opt to treat the transactions contemplated hereunder as
being subject to VAT (or other Tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction).
To the extent that the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are
confirmed by an applicable Governmental Authority to be subject to VAT (or any
other Tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction), Buyer shall pay, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent, Sellers and each of their Affiliates from,
such VAT (or any other tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction), in
addition to the Purchase Price, except to the extent that such VAT (or any
other tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction) is triggered by actions of
Sellers which actions are not contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent so
required, VAT (or any other tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction) shall
be payable by Buyer immediately upon receipt from the Sellers an invoice which
complies with the respective VAT provisions of the respective VAT Code or
other applicable Legal Requirement.

 



 

(b) With respect to the VAT fiscal unity ( _umsatzsteuerliche Organschaft_ )
between RSGG as the common parent company ( _Organtr ager_) and Rockwood Clay
Additives as controlled entity ( _Organgesellschaft_ ) (the (" _Controlled VAT
Member_ "), (i) the Controlled VAT Member shall, and the Buyer shall procure
that the Controlled VAT Member will, reimburse RSGG for any output VAT (
_Umsatzsteuer_ ), which relates to supplies rendered or advance payments
received by such Controlled VAT Member until and including the Closing Date
and is paid or otherwise settled by RSGG in its capacity as the common parent,
and (ii) RSGG shall reimburse the Controlled VAT Member for any input VAT (
_Vorsteuer_ ), which relates to supplies or advanced payments received by the
Controlled VAT Member until and including the Closing Date and is credited to
RSGG in its capacity as the common parent.

 



 

(c) The Controlled VAT Member shall not be required to reimburse RSGG pursuant
to Section 9.2(b)(i), and RSGG shall not be required to reimburse the
Controlled VAT Member pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(ii) if, and to the extent
that, the Controlled VAT Member effected payment of the respective output VAT
amount to RSGG or received payment of the respective input VAT amount from
RSGG, as the case may be, on or prior to the Closing Date. Moreover, the
Controlled VAT Member shall not be required to reimburse RSGG, and RSGG shall
not be required to compensate the Controlled VAT Member, as the case may be,
with respect to any amounts that were not reflected as a liability or asset in
the calculation of Closing Working Capital or as Transferred Company
Indebtedness. RSGG and the Controlled VAT Member shall, and Buyer shall
procure that the Controlled VAT Member will reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

cooperate to reduce the financial burden from such amounts, in particular if,
and to the extent that such reduction does not result in any material cost to
Buyer or the Controlled VAT Member.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.2 relates solely to those VAT
matters referred to herein and the provisions of Section 9.1 shall control
with respect to all other Tax matters.

 



 

9.3 _U.S. Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the twelve (12) month anniversary
thereof, Buyer shall, or shall cause Southern Clay Products to, provide (other
than with respect to any U.S. Business Employees who are represented by a
collective bargaining agreement) (i) a base salary or base wages to each U.S.
Business Employee whose employment continues following the Closing (each a "
_Continuing U.S. Employee_ ") at an annual rate that is no less than the
annual rate of the base salary or base wages that was provided to such
employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits to
the Continuing U.S. Employees that are substantially equivalent in the
aggregate to either (A) the employee benefits provided to such employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) to similarly situated employees
of Buyer or its Affiliates, disregarding (except as contemplated by the terms
of this Agreement) any, equity or equity-based compensation, Transaction
Bonuses or change of control arrangements. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause Southern Clay Products to, honor the terms of any
collective bargaining agreement and union shutdown agreement covering any of
the Continuing U.S. Employees and to continue to provide any compensation or
employee benefits required to be provided under the terms of any such
agreements. With respect to those Continuing U.S. Employees whose services are
performed pursuant to an employment agreement, effective as of the Closing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause Southern Clay Products to, honor the terms of
such employment agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall ensure that, at all times following the Closing, each
Continuing U.S. Employee receives full credit for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accruals (solely, in the case of benefit accruals, for
purposes of determining vacation and severance) for all service that was
recognized by Southern Clay Products or any of its Affiliates under Benefit
Plans with respect to such employee under each of the comparable employee
benefit plans, programs or policies of Buyer or its Affiliates (including
Southern Clay Products) in which such employee becomes or may become a
participant, provided that no such service recognition shall result in any
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Southern Clay Products shall withdraw from
participation in all Benefit Plans other than U.S. Transferred Company Benefit
Plans, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including Southern Clay Products), shall
continue to be responsible for any U.S. Transferred Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause Southern Clay Products to, provide severance
pay and benefit entitlements to any Continuing U.S. Employee whose employment
is terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including Southern Clay
Products), other than for cause, within twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, in an amount no less favorable than

 



      
 

 



 

either (i) the amount of severance pay and benefit entitlements, if any,
determined in accordance with the severance policy or agreement applicable to
such Continuing U.S. Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing or
(ii) the amount of severance pay and benefit entitlements, if any, to which
similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliates would be entitled.

 



 

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall (i) establish or maintain, or
cause to be established or maintained, one or more group health plans which
shall cover all Continuing U.S. Employees and dependents who immediately prior
to the Closing were covered under any group health plan maintained by Parent
or any of its Affiliates, (ii) waive any waiting period and any exclusion or
limitation for preexisting conditions which were covered under the health plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in which the Continuing U.S.
Employee and any eligible dependents participated immediately prior to the
Closing to the same extent recognized by Parent or any of its Affiliates
immediately Closing and (iii) grant credit (for purposes of annual
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket limits) for any covered claims
incurred or payments made prior to the Closing Date during the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs.

 



 

(f) (i) Buyer shall take all steps necessary to permit each Continuing U.S.
Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Rockwood Retirement Plan to roll over
such eligible rollover distribution as part of any lump sum cash distribution
into an account(s) under a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates
(the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_").

 



 

(ii) With respect to each Continuing U.S. Employee who is a participant in the
Rockwood Retirement Plan on the Closing Date and who continues in employment
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including Southern Clay Products) through
December 31, 2013:

 



 

(A) Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the product of ( _x)_ the
"covered compensation" under the Rockwood Retirement Plan earned by such
Continuing U.S. Employee from the beginning of the Rockwood Retirement Plans
2013 plan year through the Closing Date and _(y) _the " _Applicable
Percentage_." The Applicable Percentage shall mean the profit sharing
contribution percentage up to a maximum of 4% of a Continuing U.S. Employees
"covered compensation," as determined by Parent it its sole discretion, that
would have been made by Parent with respect to the Continuing U.S. Employee
for the Rockwood Retirement Plans 2013 plan year if the Continuing U.S.
Employee had remained in "eligible employment" under the Rockwood Retirement
Plan through the end of the 2013 plan year. The aggregate amount, if any,
payable with respect to the Continuing U.S. Employees pursuant to this Section
9.3(f)(ii)(A) (the " _Parent PSP Contribution_ ") shall be paid to Buyer as
soon as practicable (but not more than thirty (30) days) after the date that
Parent determines to make a profit sharing contribution under the Rockwood
Retirement Plan with respect to the 2013 plan year. Each Continuing U.S.
Employees allocable share of the Parent PSP Contribution shall be credited by
Buyer to the Continuing U.S. Employee under the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 



       
 

 



 

(B) Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the product of _(x) _the
"covered compensation" under the Rockwood Retirement Plan earned by such
Continuing U.S. Employee from the beginning of the Rockwood Retirement Plans
2013 plan year through the Closing Date and _(y) _3%. The aggregate amount
payable with respect to the Continuing U.S. Employees pursuant to this Section
9.3(f)(ii)(B) (the " _Parent Nonelective Contribution_ ") shall be paid to
Buyer as soon as practicable (but not more than thirty (30) days) after Parent
makes nonelective contributions under the Rockwood Retirement Plan with
respect to the 2013 plan year. Each Continuing U.S. Employees allocable share
of the Parent Nonelective Contribution shall be credited by Buyer to the
Continuing U.S. Employee under the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Parent PSP Contribution nor the
Parent Nonelective Contribution, nor any assets or liabilities associated
therewith, shall be reflected in the Final Closing Statement or be taken into
account in the calculation of Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(g) Following the Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay to the Continuing U.S.
Employees such amounts with respect to the Parents or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) bonus plans for the 2013 bonus plan
year (the " _Bonus Plans_ ") as are reflected in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital and taken into account in the calculation of the Final Closing
Statement and (ii) provide each Continuing U.S. Employee with an opportunity
to earn bonus compensation amounts with respect to the balance of the 2013
bonus plan year immediately following the Closing Date, that are no less
favorable than the bonus compensation amounts that each such Continuing U.S.
Employee had the opportunity to earn under the Bonus Plans immediately prior
to the Closing. Any amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.3(g)
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as would have applied, and
paid at such times and in such manner as such amounts would have been payable,
under the Bonus Plans.

 



 

(h) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the full amount that may become due
or payable under, taking into account any forfeiture or cancellation in
accordance with the terms of, any transaction or retention incentives, bonuses
or awards made as a result or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Transaction Bonuses_ ") to Business Employees and
directors of the Transferred Companies.

 



 

(i) Upon reasonable request, Parent shall provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall
provide to Parent, such documents, data and information as may reasonably be
necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 9.3 and to administer
their respective benefit plans.

 



 

(j) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, (i) shall confer upon any
of the employees of Parent, Buyer, the Transferred Companies or any of their
Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any right to benefits or
employment, or continued benefits or employment, for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever by reason of this Agreement, or (ii) shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this
Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party
shall be entitled

 



      
 

 



 

to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an
amendment to such benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. If a party
not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to
enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement and that provision is construed to be such
an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby
precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

 



 

9.4 _Non-U.S. Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) Rockwood Clay Additives is a member of, and the parties understand that it
will be able to continue its membership in, the pension fund _Pensionskasse f
ur die deutsche Wirtschaft e.V._ after the Closing.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the individuals set forth on _Schedule 9.4(b) of the
Disclosure Letter_ (" _Remote Employees_ "), to cease to be employed by Parent
or its Affiliates, effective as of the Closing, and Buyer shall (or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) make an offer of employment, effective as of the
Closing, to each Remote Employee.

 



 

(c) Upon reasonable request, Parent shall provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall
provide to Parent, such documents, data and information as may reasonably be
necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 9.4 and to administer
their respective benefit plans.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, (i) shall confer upon any
of the employees of Parent, Buyer, the Transferred Companies or any of their
Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any right to benefits or
employment, or continued benefits or employment, for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever by reason of this Agreement, or (ii) shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this
Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party
shall be entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds
that it is an amendment to such benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement. If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a
lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to such benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement and that
provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly
designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively
as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

 



      
 

 



 

10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
each of which will be deemed an original.

 



 

10.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,
without regard to any conflicts of law rules or principles that would result
in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Each party hereto hereby consents to, and confers exclusive jurisdiction
upon, the courts of the State of New York and the Federal courts of the United
States of America located in the County of New York in the State of New York,
and appropriate appellate courts therefrom, over any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document. Each party hereto hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such action, suit or proceeding that it is not subject to such
jurisdiction or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in said courts or that this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document may not be enforced in or by said courts or that its Assets are
exempt or immune from execution, that such action, suit or proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of such action, suit or
proceeding is improper. Parent and Buyer covenant not to initiate any such
action, suit or proceeding in any other jurisdiction. Service of process in
any such action, suit or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the State of New York, as provided in Section
10.3 herein.

 



 

(c) Each party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this paragraph.

 



 

10.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize that any breach of
the terms of this Agreement may give rise to irreparable harm for which money
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and accordingly agree that, in
addition to all other remedies available to it, any nonbreaching party shall
be entitled to seek to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy as a
remedy of money damages.

 



 

10.10 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_.

 



 

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the singular shall be
held to include the plural and vice versa, (ii) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Letter) and not to

 



      
 

 



 

any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article, Section, Exhibit and
Schedule references are to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits, and Schedules to
this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter unless otherwise specified, (iii)
except where the context otherwise requires, references to a "party" or
"parties" shall mean Buyer or Parent, or both of them as the context requires,
(iv) the word "including" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation," unless the context
otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, (v) the word "or" shall not
be exclusive, (vi) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean
the degree to which a subject or thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean
simply "if", (vii) unless a contrary intent is apparent, any contract,
instrument or Legal Requirement defined or referred to herein means such
contract, instrument or Legal Requirement as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
Legal Requirement, (viii) except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, any
accounting terms shall be given their definition under GAAP, (ix) the phrase
"ordinary course of business" shall mean "ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice" and (x) any document or information shall be
deemed to have been "made available" only if such document or information was
posted to the electronic dataroom created for the purpose of aiding in Buyers
diligence investigation or otherwise delivered to Buyer on or before the date
that is prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(b) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement and any
and all agreements and instruments subject to the terms hereof, the parties
understand and agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated,
prepared and drafted, and if at any time the parties hereto desire or are
required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement
or instrument subject hereto, no consideration will be given to the issue of
which party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of
this Agreement or any agreement or instrument subject hereto.

 



 

10.11 _Third Person Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. Each of Buyer and
Parent may assert the rights of Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees,
respectively, pursuant to Article VIII hereof.

 



 

10.12 _Representations and Warranties; Schedules_. Neither the specification
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties set forth in
Article II nor the indemnification provisions of Article VIII nor the
inclusion of any items in any Schedule of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed
to constitute an admission by Parent or Buyer, or otherwise imply or create
any presumption, that any such amounts or the items so included are material
for the purposes of this Agreement, or that any such item meets any or all of
the criteria set forth in this Agreement for inclusion in such Schedule to the
Disclosure Letter or any other Schedule to the Disclosure Letter. It is
understood and agreed that nothing in the Disclosure Letter is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty of Parent set forth in
Article II of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed only with respect to
the Section of this Agreement to which such Schedule corresponds and to any
other Schedule of the Disclosure Letter to the extent the relevance of such
disclosure to such other Schedule of the Disclosure Letter is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. Any capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Letter or

 



      
 

 



 

any Schedule hereto or thereto but not otherwise defined therein shall be
defined as set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

10.13 _Severability_. Except as provided in Section 4.15(e), if any one or
more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will not be affected thereby, and Parent and
Buyer will use their reasonable efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal
and enforceable provisions which insofar as practicable implement the purposes
and intent hereof. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
each party waives any provision of applicable Legal Requirements which renders
any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect.

 



 

10.14 _Guaranty_. Guarantor irrevocably guarantees each obligation of Buyer,
and the full and timely performance by Buyer of its obligations, in each case,
under the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance, and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees
that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or
extinguishment of Buyers liabilities and obligations (other than in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, as
applicable), whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will
affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee.
Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of Parent, (i) any right to require
Parent, as a condition of payment or performance of Guarantor, to proceed
against Buyer or pursue any other remedies whatsoever and (ii) to the fullest
extent permitted by Legal Requirements, any defenses or benefits that may be
derived from or afforded by Legal Requirements that limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense
is available to Buyer under this Agreement. Guarantor understands that Parent
is relying on this guarantee in entering into this Agreement.
