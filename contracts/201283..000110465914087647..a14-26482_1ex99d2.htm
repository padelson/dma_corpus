required or reasonably believe to be required to deduct and withhold from such
consideration in accordance with applicable Tax Laws. Any such amounts shall
be deducted, withheld and remitted from the consideration payable pursuant to

(i) the Board first determines in good faith, after consultation with its

confidentiality, standstill, non-disclosure, use, business purpose or similar
agreement, restriction or covenant with the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries;

 



 

(iii) the Company has been, and would be after entering into or participating
in any such discussions or negotiations, in compliance with all of its
obligations under this Section 7.2;

 



 

(iv) prior to providing any such copies, access or disclosure, the Company

and then within 24 hours in writing, of any proposal, inquiry, offer or
request relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal or any amendments
to the foregoing or any request for non-public information relating to the

Proposal or for access to the properties, facilities, books or records of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any person that informs the
Company or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto. If in writing or electronic
form, the Company shall provide a copy thereof to the Purchaser Parties, and

request and shall provide the identity of the person making any such

terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or request
and answer the Purchaser Parties혪 reasonable questions with respect thereto.
The Company shall provide to the Purchaser Parties copies of all
correspondence if in writing or electronic form, and if not in writing or

(g) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal prior to the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by the
Common Shareholders, the Board may accept, approve or recommend such
Acquisition Proposal and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if and only if:

such Superior Proposal pursuant to an existing confidentiality, standstill,
non-disclosure, use, business purpose or similar agreement, restriction or
covenant (that had not otherwise been waived);

 



 

(ii) the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance with all of its
obligations under this Section 7.2;

the determination of the Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Board to enter into such
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, together with a
written notice from the Board regarding the value and financial terms that the
Board, in consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, has determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under such Acquisition Proposal (the " **Superior
Proposal Notice** ");

 



 

(iv) the Company has provided the Purchaser Parties with a copy of the
proposed definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal and all supporting
materials, including any financing documents supplied to the Company in
connection therewith;

 



 

(v) at least five business days (the " **Matching Period** ") have elapsed
from the date that is the later of the date on which the Purchaser Parties
received the Superior Proposal Notice and the date on which the Purchaser
Parties received all of the materials set forth in Section 7.2(g)(iv);

 



 

(vi) during any Matching Period, the Purchaser Parties have had the
opportunity (but not the obligation), to offer to amend this Agreement and the
Arrangement in order for such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior
Proposal;

 



 

(vii) after the expiry of the Matching Period, the Board (i) has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (if
applicable, compared to the terms of the Arrangement as proposed to be amended
by the Purchaser under Section 7.2(h)) and (ii) has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that recommending that the
Company enter into a

 



      
 

 



 

definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal is necessary in
order for the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(viii) the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(d)(ii) _[Termination By the Company]_ ; and

 



 

(ix) the Company has previously, or concurrently shall have, paid to
AcquisitionCo the Termination Fee.

 



 

(h) During the Matching Period, or such longer period as the Company may
approve in writing for such purpose: (i) the Board shall review any offer made
by the Purchaser Parties under Section 7.2(g)(vi) to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement in good faith in order to determine whether such
proposal would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal previously
constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal; and (ii)
the Company shall negotiate in good faith with the Purchaser Parties to make
such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would
enable the Purchaser Parties to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on such amended terms. If the Board determines that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
promptly so advise the Purchaser Parties and the Company and the Purchaser
Parties shall amend this Agreement to reflect such offer made by the Purchaser
Parties, and shall take and cause to be taken all such actions as are
necessary to give effect to the foregoing.

 



 

(i) The Board shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement by
news release after any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or made if:
(i) the Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior
Proposal; or (ii) the Board determines that an amendment to the terms of the
Arrangement has been agreed that results in the Acquisition Proposal not being
a Superior Proposal. The Purchaser Parties and their counsel and other
advisors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
form and content of any such news release.

 



 

(j) Each successive amendment or modification of any Acquisition Proposal
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2
and the Purchaser Parties shall be afforded a new Matching Period from the
later of the date on which the Purchaser received the Superior Proposal Notice
and the date on which the Purchaser received all of the materials set forth in
Section 7.2(g)(iv) with respect to the new Superior Proposal from the Company.

 



 

(k) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) limit in any way the
obligation of the Company to convene and hold the Company Meeting in
accordance with Section 2.2 _[Implementation Steps by the Company]_ of this
Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 8
_[Term, Termination, Amendment and Waiver]_ ; or (ii) prevent the Board from
complying with section 2.17 of Multilateral Instrument 62-104 _Takeover Bids
and Issuer Bids_ and similar provisions under Securities Laws relating to the
provision of directors혪 circulars and making appropriate disclosure to its
securityholders.

 



 

(l) The Company shall advise the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents of the prohibitions
set forth in this Section 7.2 and any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 7.2 by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents is deemed to be a breach of this Section
7.2 by the Company.

 



 

 **7.3** **Agreement as to Damages**

 



 

The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to AcquisitionCo by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to $270,000,000 (the "
**Termination Fee** ") if:

 



 

(a) either Purchaser Party shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(c)(i) or 8.2(c)(iii) _[Termination By the Purchaser Parties]_ ,
in which case payment shall be made within two business days of such
termination; or

 



 

(b) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section

made to AcquisitionCo in accordance with Section 7.2(g)(ix) _[Non-
Solicitation]_ ; or

 



 

(c) (i) after the date hereof, but prior to the termination of this Agreement,
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or proposed to the Company or
otherwise publicly announced, or a person shall have publicly announced an
intention to do so;

 



 

(ii) the Common Shareholders혪 Vote shall have been held prior to the Outside
Date, while any Acquisition Proposal remains outstanding and the Arrangement
Resolution shall not have been approved pursuant thereto; and

 



 

(iii) within 365 days after the date of the termination of this Agreement, the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (c)(i) above is consummated by the
Company, in which case payment shall be made on the date on which such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated.

 



 

(d) The Company shall only be obligated to pay the Termination Fee once
pursuant to this Section 7.3.

 



 

 **7.4** **Expense Reimbursement**

 



 

(a) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to AcquisitionCo by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the reasonable documented out-of-
pocket expenses of the Purchaser Parties and their respective affiliates
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated herein (to a maximum
of $20,000,000), including but not limited to, financial advisor fees,
regulatory filing fees, fees of outside legal counsel and all other general
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection the Arrangement
(the " **Expense Reimbursement** "), without prejudice to any other rights it
may have, if this Agreement shall have been terminated by either of the
Purchaser Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(ii) _[Termination By the
Purchaser Parties]_ , such payment to be made within two business days of any
such termination.

 



 

(b) The Company shall only be obligated to pay the Expense Reimbursement once
pursuant to this Section 7.4.

 



 

(c) No Expense Reimbursement shall be payable pursuant to this Section 7.4 if
the Company has paid the Termination Fee and the Company shall only be
required to pay the difference between the Termination Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement if, after the

 



      
 

 



 

Company has paid the Expense Reimbursement to AcquisitionCo, the Company
becomes obligated to pay the Termination Fee.

 



 

 **7.5** **Fees and Expenses**

 



 

Except as provided in Section 7.4 _[Expense Reimbursement]_ and 5.2 _[Pre-
Acquisition Reorganizations]_ , each Party shall pay all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Agreement and the
Arrangement. The Purchaser Parties shall pay the filing fees required to
obtain the Key Regulatory Approvals, including any applicable Taxes.

 



 

 **7.6** **Liquidated Damages**

 



 

The Parties acknowledge that the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in
Section 7.3 _[Agreement as to Damages]_ is the payment of liquidated damages
that is a genuine pre-estimate of the damages the Purchaser Parties will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a penalty. The Company
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the
Purchaser Parties agree that their right to receive payment of the amount
determined pursuant to Section 7.3 _[Agreement as to Damages]_ in the manner
provided therein is the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Parties in
respect of the event giving rise to such payment provided that this limitation
shall not apply in the event of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by
the Company.

information that, in the opinion of Company, acting reasonably, is
competitively sensitive (provided that the Company acknowledges and agrees
that external counsel to the Purchaser Parties may have access to such
information on a privileged and confidential basis in connection with
obtaining Regulatory Approvals) or may result in jeopardizing the Company혪s
legal privilege in respect of such information.

alternative, with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, not to be
unreasonably withheld, purchase run off directors혪 and officers혪 liability

event none of the Purchaser Parties, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall have any further obligation under this Section 7.9(a).

 **9.2** **Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial**

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the Laws of the Province of Alberta and the Laws of Canada
applicable therein, and shall be construed and treated in all respects as an
Alberta contract. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Alberta in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement and the
Arrangement. Each Party hereby waives any right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

 



 

The Purchaser hereby irrevocably designates Bennett Jones LLP (in such
capacity, the " **Process Agent** "), with an office at 4500 Bankers Hall
East, 855 - 2nd Street, S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 4K7, as its
designee, appointee and agent to receive, for and on its behalf service of
process in such jurisdiction in any legal action or proceedings with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and such service
shall be deemed complete upon delivery thereof to the Process Agent; provided
that in the case of any such service upon the Process Agent, the party
effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to the Purchaser in
the manner provided in Section 9.1 _[Notices]_. The Purchaser shall take all
such action as may be necessary to continue said appointment in full force and
effect or to appoint another agent so that Purchaser shall at all times have
an agent for service of process for the above purposes in Calgary, Alberta,
Canada. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve process in
any manner permitted by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.3** **Injunctive Relief**

 



 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, except as provided
for in Section 7.6 _[Liquidated Damages]_ , the Parties shall be entitled to
equitable remedies, including specific performance, a restraining order and
interlocutory, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being
waived. Such remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of
this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law
or equity to each of the Parties.

 



 

 **9.4** **Time of Essence**

 



 

Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.5** **Assignment, Binding Effect and Entire Agreement**

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
Parties hereto, provided that if such assignment and/or assumption takes
place, the Purchaser Parties shall continue to be liable jointly and severally
with such assignee for all of its obligations hereunder. The above
notwithstanding, each of the Purchaser Parties may assign all or any part of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto to one or more of such party혪s direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries or any combination thereof, and provided further that if such
assignment takes place, the Purchaser Parties shall continue to be fully
liable as primary obligor, on a joint and several basis with any such person,
to the Company for any default in performance by the assignee of any of such
Purchaser Party혪s obligations hereunder.

 



 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(c) This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto and the Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, both written and oral, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no
representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements,
express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically
set forth in this Agreement. The Parties have not relied and are not relying
on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into and
completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.6** **Further Assurances**

 



 

Each Party hereto shall, from time to time and at all times hereafter, at the
request of the other Parties hereto, but without further consideration, do all
such further acts and things, and execute and deliver all

 



      
 

 



 

such further documents and instruments and provide all such further assurances
as may be reasonably required in order to fully perform and carry out the
terms and intent hereof.

 



 

 **9.7** **Severability**

 



 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **9.8** **No Third Party Beneficiaries**

 



 

Except as provided in Sections 2.10 _[Treatment of Incentive Securities]_ and
7.9 _[Insurance and Indemnification]_ , and except for the rights of the
Shareholders and Incentive Holders to receive the consideration contemplated
by this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement following the Effective Time,
which rights are hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Purchaser Parties, this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than
the Parties to this Agreement. The Purchaser Parties appoint the Company as
the trustee for the employees, directors and officers of the Company and the
Incentive Holders, as applicable, of the covenants of the Purchaser and/or
AcquisitionCo as specified in Sections 2.10 _[Treatment of Incentive
Securities]_ and 7.9 _[Insurance and Indemnification]_ of this Agreement and
the Company accepts such appointment.

 



 

 **9.9** **Counterparts, Execution**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The Parties shall be entitled to rely upon
delivery of an executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this
Agreement, and such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall be
legally effective to create a valid and binding agreement between the Parties.

 



 

 ** _[Rest of the Page Intentionally Left Blank]_**

 



      
 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** each of the Purchaser Parties and the Company have
caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by
their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

 **ARTICLE 4 
CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS**

 



 

 **4.1** **Payment of Consideration**

 



 

(a) Forthwith following the Effective Time, AcquisitionCo and the Company
shall, subject to Section 4.1(b) of this Plan of Arrangement, cause to be paid
to the Company Shareholders and the Incentive Holders the amounts payable in
respect of Interests required by Section 3.1 of this Plan of Arrangement, as
applicable.

 



 

(b) Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate or
certificates which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding Common Shares or outstanding Preferred Shares that were
transferred and acquired pursuant to Section 3.1(f) and Section 3.1(g) hereof,
as applicable, together with a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary
may reasonably require, the Company Shareholders represented by such
surrendered certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, the consideration which such
holder has the right to receive under this Plan of Arrangement for such Common
Shares and Preferred Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.3
hereof, and any certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, each certificate, agreement, letter or
other instrument, as applicable, that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Interests shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive
the consideration in respect of such Interests required under this Plan of
Arrangement, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section

 



      
 

 



 

4.3 hereof. Any such certificate formerly representing Common Shares or
Preferred Shares not duly surrendered on or before the day that is three years
less one day from the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim by or
interest of any kind or nature against or in any of the Company or the
Purchaser Parties. On such date, any and all consideration to which such
former holder of Common Shares or Preferred Shares was entitled shall be
deemed to have been surrendered to AcquisitionCo.

 



 

(d) Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary pursuant to this Plan
of Arrangement that has not been deposited or has been returned to the
Depositary or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the
second anniversary of the Effective Time, shall be returned by the Depositary
to AcquisitionCo. Any right or claim to payment hereunder that remains
outstanding on the day that is three years less one day from the Effective
Date shall cease to represent a right or claim by or interest of any kind or
nature and the right of a former holder of Interests to receive the
consideration for such Interests pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall
terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited for no consideration.

 



 

(e) No former holder of Interests shall be entitled to receive any
consideration with respect to such Interests other than the consideration to
which such former holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section
3.1, this Section 4.1 and, as applicable, Section 5.1 and, for greater
certainty, no such holder shall be entitled to receive any interest,
dividends, premium or other payment thereon or in connection therewith.

 

 ** **

 

 **4.2** **Lost Certificates**

 



 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Common Shares or Preferred Shares that
were transferred pursuant to Section 3.1(f) or Section 3.1(g) of this Plan of
Arrangement shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, AcquisitionCo or the Depositary, as applicable, will
issue and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
the consideration to which the holder is entitled pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement. When authorizing such issuance and delivery in exchange for any
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person to whom such consideration
is to be issued and delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery
of such consideration, give a bond satisfactory to AcquisitionCo (acting
reasonably) in such sum as AcquisitionCo may direct, or otherwise indemnify
AcquisitionCo in a manner satisfactory to AcquisitionCo, acting reasonably,
against any claim that may be made against AcquisitionCo with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

 **4.3** **Withholding Rights**

 



 

The Company, AcquisitionCo and the Depositary, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to
any Company Shareholder or Incentive Holder under this Plan of Arrangement
(including any amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof), such amounts
as the Company, AcquisitionCo or the Depositary, as applicable, determines,
acting reasonably, are required to be deducted and withheld from such
consideration in accordance with the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada), R.S.C. 1985,
c.1 (5th Supp.), the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any
provision of any other applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such withholding was made,
provided that such deducted and withheld amounts are remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 
DISSENT RIGHTS**

 



 

 **5.1** **Dissent Rights**

 



 

Registered Common Shareholders and registered Preferred Shareholders may
exercise Dissent Rights with respect to the Common Shares and Preferred
Shares, respectively, held by such registered holders in connection with the
Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in section 190 of the
CBCA, as modified by the Interim Order and this Section 5.1, provided that
registered Company Shareholders who duly and validly exercise such Dissent
Rights and who:

 



 

(a) are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their Common Shares or
their Preferred Shares, as applicable, shall (i) be deemed not to have
participated in the transactions in Section 3.1 hereof, other than Section
3.1(d) and Section 3.1(e), as applicable, (ii) be paid an amount equal to such
fair value by the Company, (iii) not be entitled to any other payment or
consideration, including any payment that would be payable under the
Arrangement had such registered Company Shareholders not exercised their
Dissent Rights in respect of such Common Shares or Preferred Shares, and (iv)
be deemed to have transferred their Dissenting Shares to AcquisitionCo in
accordance with Section 3.1(e) and Section 3.1(d) hereof, as applicable,
notwithstanding the provisions of section 190 of the CBCA; or

 



 

(b) are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for
their Common Shares or their Preferred Shares, as applicable, shall (i) be
deemed to have participated in the Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, on
the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Common Shares or Preferred
Shares, as applicable, and (ii) be entitled to receive only the consideration
contemplated in Section 3.1(f) or Section 3.1(g) hereof, as applicable, that
such Company Shareholder would have received pursuant to the Arrangement if
such Company Shareholder had not exercised Dissent Rights;

 



 

provided, however, that no registered Preferred Shareholder who has exercised
its Dissent Rights shall be entitled to be paid the fair value for its
Preferred Shares if the Preferred Share Acquisition Condition is not
satisfied; and provided further that in no case shall the Company, either
Purchaser Party or any other person be required after the Effective Time to
recognize any Company Shareholder who exercises Dissent Rights as a holder of
Common Shares or, if the Preferred Share Acquisition Condition is satisfied,
Preferred Shares, as the case may be, and the names of such Company
Shareholders who exercise Dissent Rights shall be removed from the registers
of Common Shares and Preferred Shares, as applicable, maintained by or on
behalf of the Company, as of the Effective Time.

Shareholders, as applicable, in the manner and as otherwise directed by the

following the Effective Date unilaterally by AcquisitionCo, provided that it
