Republic of China, with corporate seat in Beijing, trade register
number 110107016735242, address at Beijing International Club Office Tower,
Room 302, No. 21, Jian Guo Men Wai Street, Beijing, Peoples Republic of China
("JAC Capital"); and 
---|--- 
 



    _(3)_  | __WISE ROAD CAPITAL LTD, an exempted limited company

company registration number 299533 ("Wise Road" and hereinafter jointly with
JAC Capital referred to as the "Purchasers" and each a "Purchaser"). 
---|--- 

BACKGROUND:

 



    _(A)_ __ | __The Seller s Group is active in (a) the business of
researching, designing, developing, testing, manufacturing, commercializing,
packaging, marketing, distributing, selling and servicing
discrete semiconductor devices, low complexity ICs and integrated passives
through the following NXP business lines: (i) BL GA Discretes, (ii) BL
PowerMOS and (iii) BL Logic, a representative list of such products being
included in Schedule 18 to the IP Transfer and License Agreement (the
"Products") and (b) the business of designing, developing, building,
assembling, installing and maintaining high speed and high quality
semiconductor assembly and test equipment for die placement and taping,
integrated circuit testing, molding, wire bonding, vision and data handling,
and of developing process recipes and software related to the use and
maintenance of said equipment through ITEC (the businesses under (a) and (b)
hereafter the "Business"). For the avoidance of doubt, any business (e.g. in
respect of the small PowerMOS eSwitch discretes) historically conducted by
Freescale Semiconductor does not form part of the Business;  
---|--- 



    _(B)_ __ | __Prior to Completion, the Seller will incorporate a
private company under the Laws of the Netherlands under the name of "Nexperia
HoldCo Netherlands B.V." (the "Company"), and will hold all the issued and
outstanding shares of the Company (the "Shares"). The Business will be
conducted through the Target Group Companies ultimately as of Completion; 
---|--- 
 



1 / 52 through a controlled auction process and the Purchasers have been selected as
the purchasers of the Business; 
---|--- 
 



    _(D)_ __ | __The Seller and JAC Capital entered into a non-disclosure
agreement dated 8 February 2016 (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement"), pursuant to
which certain confidential information relating to the Business was made
available to the members of the Purchasers Group and their Representatives; 
---|--- 
 



    _(E)_  | __The Seller gave the Purchasers and their Representatives
(i) access to the Data Room, (ii) the opportunity to attend and participate
in meetings with the Business management and relevant experts, and (iii) the
opportunity to ask and to receive answers to questions the Purchasers deemed
necessary in relation to the Business and the Transaction. On that basis, the
Purchasers and their Representatives have completed a comprehensive
due diligence investigation with respect to the Business; 
---|--- 



    _(F)_ __ | __At or prior to Completion, the Seller will procure that
the Company will directly or indirectly hold all of the issued shares in the
Dedicated Companies and other Target Group Companies (free of Encumbrances)
and the Seller will procure the transfer of the assets (free of Encumbrances)
and liabilities attributable to the Business to the Target Group Companies in
accordance with _Schedule 10_ ( _Disentanglement Plan_ ) and the other
provisions of this agreement (the "Disentanglement"), save for those assets
and liabilities not to be transferred to the Target Group Companies as set out
in this agreement; 
---|--- 
 



    _(G)_  | __The Seller has been provided with copies of the Equity
Commitment Letters, executed by the Fund Investors and the Purchasers; 
---|--- 
 



    _(H)_ __ | __The Seller has been provided with evidence that the
Purchasers have taken reasonable steps to ensure that they will have
sufficient funds available outside the People s Republic of China to be
readily able to pay the Completion Amount at Completion; 
---|--- 



    _(I)_  | __The Parties have entered into the Escrow Agreement and the
Purchasers have procured the deposit of the Deposit Amount into the Escrow
Account; and 
---|--- 
 



    _(J)_ __ | __Now, in consideration of the foregoing, the Seller
wishes to sell and transfer the Shares to the Purchasers in portions to be
determined by the Purchasers, and the Purchasers wish to acquire the Shares
from the Seller, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this
agreement (the "Transaction ). 
---|--- 
 



2 / 52 THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:



   1 | DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION 
---|--- 

In this agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions and
provisions of _Schedule 1_ ( _Definitions and interpretation_ ) apply
throughout.



   2 | SALE, PURCHASE AND TRANSFER 
---|--- 



   2.1 | Sale and purchase 
---|--- 

On the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, the Seller
hereby sells the Shares to the Purchasers, and the Purchasers hereby purchase
the Shares from the Seller.



   2.2 | Transfer 
---|--- 

At Completion, the Seller shall transfer the Shares to the Purchasers
free from any Encumbrances and together with all rights and obligations
attached to the Shares.



   2.3 | Directions of proportions and nomination other party 
---|--- 



   2.3.1 | Subject to the Purchasers being jointly and severally liable (
_hoofdelijk aansprakelijk_ ) for all obligations of the Purchasers under this
agreement, the Purchasers shall direct the proportions in which they are
to receive and accept the Shares and the Shareholder Loan (if applicable) at
Completion no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Completion
Date. 
---|--- 



   2.3.2 | The Purchasers shall be entitled to nominate, to the extent
permitted by Law, at their own cost, by notice to the Seller delivered no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Completion Date, an
entity incorporated, and (directly or indirectly) wholly owned jointly, by
the Purchasers to which entity all of the Shares will be transferred and the
Shareholder Loan will be assigned at Completion (if applicable), provided that
such nomination shall not (i) adversely impact the satisfaction of the
Completion Conditions set out in Clause 4.1, or (ii) derogate from the
Purchasers obligations towards the Seller under this agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   2.4 | Benefit and risk 
---|--- 

Subject to Completion, the Transaction will be effective as of the Effective
Time and consequently, subject to the other provisions of this agreement, the
benefit and risk of the Shares, together with the benefit and risk of the
Target Group, will be for the account of the Purchasers as of the Effective
Time.

 



3 / 52 ---|--- 



   2.5.1 | Within a reasonable period after the Signing Date and prior to
the Completion Date, the Purchasers may propose to the Seller their desired
structure for the Transaction, including the funding of the Target Group and
the Disentanglement partly through the provision of a shareholder loan by the
Seller to the Company or through the Company to any other Target Group Company
pursuant to Paragraph 2.3(b) of _Schedule 10_ ( _Disentanglement Plan_ ). To
the extent that such proposal is reasonable and possible, the Seller and the
Purchasers shall discuss in good faith further details of the proposal,
including the amount of the shareholder loan and applicable interest rate (the
principal amount and all accrued interest of the shareholder loan up to and
including the Completion Date, the "Shareholder Loan"). 
---|--- 



   2.5.2 | The Shareholder Loan shall be acquired by the Purchasers at
Completion at its nominal value against payment of the Purchase Price. In this
case, the purchase price for the Shares will be reduced accordingly so that
the total consideration for the Shares and Shareholder Loan remains the

Clearance Filings. 
---|--- 
 



   4.3.3 | The Purchasers shall provide the Seller and its legal counsel
with drafts of all written filings and other communication intended to be
submitted to any Competition Authority in respect of any Merger Clearance

participate in all meetings, phone calls, correspondence and discussions with
any Competition Authority in connection with a Merger Clearance Filing.
Business secrets and other confidential information in respect of any Party or
the Target Group Companies may be redacted by the Parties (and/or only
provided to a Partys legal counsel on a privileged basis) as long as the
Seller and the Purchasers act reasonably in identifying such material for
redaction. To the extent applicable merger control regimes provide for such
possibility, the Seller and its legal counsel may, but are not obliged to,
make confidentiality claims with respect to any of the approvals, consents or

   4.3.5 | The Purchasers shall, and shall procure that their Affiliates
will, refrain from carrying out any action (including making or agreeing to

Competition Authorities pursuant to any Merger Clearance Filings, including
by agreeing to perform or accept any disposal of assets or businesses of the
Purchasers Group and to perform any behavioural remedies or conditions that
may be necessary to obtain clearance from the Competition Authorities (the
"Merger Clearance Remedies"), whereby the Purchasers shall be entitled to
engage in discussions and negotiations with any and all relevant Competition
on the nature and scope of such measures, to ensure that any Merger Clearance
Remedies agreed upon are the narrowest possible measures with the least
possible impact on the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, any such disposal
of assets or businesses or behavioural remedies will have no impact on the
Purchase Price and any costs related to any disposal of assets or businesses
or to any such other remedies, or both, will be for the Purchasers sole
account. The Seller will provide reasonable cooperation in respect of all

Indemnified Party, but in accordance with the Relevant Indemnifying Partys
instructions, it being agreed that the Relevant Indemnifying Party shall keep
the Relevant Indemnified Party informed of all relevant matters relating to
the claim and shall forward or procure to be forwarded to the Relevant
