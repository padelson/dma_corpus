### (e) the Buyer shall pay to each Company Stockholder the Per Share Cash
Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration into which his or her
Company Shares are converted pursuant to Section 1.5 by delivery of a
promissory note in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, which note shall
be backed by a standby letter of credit issued by a bank mutually

     

   

### acceptable to the Buyer and the Company, the costs of which shall be paid
at Closing by the Company Stockholders, and which may be repaid by delivery
to each Company Stockholder of the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per
Share Stock Consideration into which his or her Company Shares are converted
pursuant to Section 1.5;

  

### (f) the Buyer shall deliver the aggregate Per Share Option Consideration
to the Company, which shall pay by check or by wire transfer to each
Optionholder the Per Share Option Consideration into which his or her Options
are converted pursuant to Section 1.5; and

  

### (g) the Buyer, the Indemnification Representative and the Escrow Agent
shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement, and the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary shall deposit an amount in cash equal to $20,000,000
(the "Escrow Cash") with the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 1.9.

  

## 1.4 _Additional Action_. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after
the Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the
Transitory Subsidiary, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

## 1.5 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any Party or the holder of any of the
following securities:

  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of common stock
of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of
common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) _Treasury Stock_. Each Company Share held in the Companys treasury
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each Company Share
owned beneficially by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without payment of
any consideration therefor.

  

### (c) _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Equity_. The aggregate
merger consideration to be paid by the Buyer at the Closing in respect of all
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and all of the
outstanding Company Vested Stock Options shall be (i) One Hundred Ninety
Million Dollars ($190,000,000) (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) a number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock with a value of $10,000,000, based on the
Buyer Common Stock Price (the "Stock Consideration") (the amount of the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration collectively, the "Purchase
Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof. The Stock
Consideration may be paid in any combination of cash and/or Buyer
Common Stock at the sole option of Buyer; provided that if Buyer chooses to
pay all or a portion of the Stock Consideration in cash, the amount shall
equal the greater of (i) the value of the shares of Buyer Common Stock not
delivered based on the Buyer Common Stock Price and (ii) the value of the
shares of Buyer Common Stock not delivered based on the closing price of the
Buyer Common Stock on the trading day prior to the Closing Date. At the
Closing:

     

   

#### (i) each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Company Shares owned beneficially by the Buyer or

Companys treasury) shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive, (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration, (B) the Per Share Stock
Consideration, (C) the Per Share 2007 Stockholder Earnout Amount and (D) the
Per Share 2008 Earnout Amount, without any interest thereon;

  

#### (ii) each Company Vested Stock Option issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right
to receive, in cash, (A) the excess of (1) the Per Share Option Consideration
less (2) the exercise price per share of the Company Shares subject to such
Company Vested Stock Option, (B) the Per Share 2007 Optionholder Earnout
Amount and (C) the Per Share 2008 Earnout Amount, without any interest
thereon; and

  

#### (iii) each Company Unvested Stock Option shall be cancelled without
payment of consideration therefor.

  

## 1.6 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

  

### (a) _Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

#### (i) Not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide the Buyer with an estimated balance sheet of the
Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement of the estimated Closing
Working Capital derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet ("Estimated
Closing Working Capital"). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP and the Estimated Closing
Working Capital shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with Schedule
1.6(a) attached hereto.

  

#### (ii) If Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than Target Working
Capital, then the Cash Consideration payable at Closing will be decreased by
the positive difference between Estimated Closing Working Capital and Target
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Shortfall"). If
Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than Target Working Capital,
then the Cash Consideration payable at Closing will be increased by the
positive difference between Estimated Closing Working Capital and Target
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Excess").
"Target Working Capital" shall be $13,198,055.

  

### (b) _Post-Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

#### (i) Following the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
provided herein to reflect the difference between Closing Working Capital and
Estimated Closing Working Capital.

  

#### (ii) Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver
to the Indemnification Representative a balance sheet of the Company as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
reviewed by the Companys independent

     

   

#### accountants, and a statement of Closing Working Capital derived from the
Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Working Capital Statement"). The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Closing
Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with Schedule
1.6(a) attached hereto. The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Working Capital Statement. The Surviving Corporation shall assist
the Indemnification Representative with his review of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement and all financial statements
and work papers related thereto. The Indemnification Representative shall
have reasonable access to the books and records (including financial
statements and work papers) of the Surviving Corporation during regular
business hours for the purpose of verifying the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Working Capital Statement.

  

#### (iii) The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital
Statement (and the computation of Closing Working Capital indicated thereon)
delivered to the Indemnification Representative by the Buyer shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties unless the
Indemnification Representative, within 30 days after delivery to the
Indemnification Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Working Capital Statement, notifies the Buyer in writing that the
Indemnification Representative disputes any of the amounts set forth therein,
specifying in detail the nature of the dispute and the basis therefor.  The
parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute and, if the
parties so resolve all disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Working Capital Statement (and the computation of Closing Working
Capital indicated thereon), as amended to the extent necessary to reflect
the resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. If the parties do not reach agreement in resolving the dispute
within 30 days after notice is given by the Indemnification Representative to
the Buyer pursuant to the second preceding sentence, the parties shall submit
the dispute to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm which is
mutually agreeable to the parties (the "Arbiter") for resolution. If the
parties cannot agree on the selection of an independent accounting firm to
act as Arbiter, the parties shall request the American Arbitration
Association to appoint such firm, and such appointment shall be conclusive
and binding on the parties. Promptly, but no later than 20 days
after acceptance of his or her appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall
determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the Arbiter
shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on
written submissions by the Buyer and the Indemnification Representative, and
not by independent review, only those issues in dispute and shall render a
written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the resulting
computation of the Closing Working Capital which shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties. All proceedings conducted by the Arbiter shall take
place in Boston, Massachusetts. In resolving any disputed item, the
Arbiter (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 1.6 and (y) may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such items
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
items claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiter
shall be equally allocated to and borne by the Buyer and the Company
Stockholders.

  

#### (iv) Upon final determination of Closing Working Capital as provided in
Section 1.6(b)(iii) above, (A) if Closing Working Capital is greater than
Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Cash Consideration shall be increased
by the excess of Closing Working Capital over Estimated Closing Working
Capital (the "Working Capital Excess"), and the Buyer

     

   

#### shall promptly, but no later than five business days after such final
determination, pay the Additional Cash Per Share to the Company Stockholders
and Optionholders (by check or by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to accounts previously designated by each Company Stockholder and each
Optionholder), and (B) if Closing Working Capital is less than Estimated
Closing Working Capital, the Cash Consideration shall be decreased by the
excess of Estimated Closing Working Capital over Closing Working Capital, and
the Company Stockholders shall pay to the Buyer the amount of
such difference, (the "Working Capital Shortfall").

  

#### (v) If an amount is payable to the Buyer pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(iv),
such amount shall be paid to the Buyer within five business days after a
final determination by the Company Stockholders, jointly and severally, in
cash, by cashiers or certified check or by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Buyer within such period. If
the amount is not paid by the Company Stockholders within such period, (i)
such amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Cash and any
earnout payment due pursuant to Section 1.8 shall be paid to the Escrow Agent
as Escrow Cash to the extent of such payment (less amounts paid by the
Company Stockholders to the Escrow Agent as Escrow Cash) and (ii) such amount
shall remain due and payable by the Company Stockholders to the Escrow Agent
as Escrow Cash.

  

## 1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

### (a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration unless the Company Stockholder holding
such Dissenting Shares shall have forfeited his, her or its right to
appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation Law or properly withdrawn
his, her or its demand for appraisal. If such Company Stockholder has so
forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting
Shares, then, (i) as of the occurrence of such event, such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted
into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 1.5, and (ii) promptly
following the occurrence of such event, the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall deliver to such Company Stockholder a payment representing
the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.5.

  

### (b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation Law.  The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

## 1.8 _Earnout_.

  

### (a) _Earnout Payment_. In addition to the consideration payable and/or
issuable to the Company Stockholders and Optionholders pursuant to Sections
1.5 and 1.6 hereof, the Company Stockholders shall be entitled to

     

   

### receive the Per Share 2007 Stockholder Earnout Amount and the Per Share
2008 Earnout Amount and the Optionholders shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share 2007 Optionholder Earnout Amount and the Per Share 2008 Earnout
Amount multiplied by the number of shares held by each Company Stockholder
and underlying the Company Vested Stock Options held by each Optionholder as
applicable.

  

### (b) _Time for Determination_.

  

#### (i) Within 10 days following the completion of the audited financial
statements of Buyer for each of the Earnout Periods, Buyer shall determine
the Earnout EBITDA for such Earnout Period (the "Applicable Earnout EBITDA")
and deliver to the Indemnification Representative a copy of such computation.
Upon the request of the Indemnification Representative, the Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Indemnification Representative income statement
and expense detail supporting the calculation of the Applicable Earnout
EBITDA for such Earnout Period. Such computation delivered to
the Indemnification Representative by the Buyer shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties, unless the Indemnification Representative, within
30 days after delivery to the Indemnification Representative of such
computation, notifies the Buyer in writing that the Indemnification
Representative disputes any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying the
nature of the dispute and the basis therefor. Immediately following delivery
of the computation of the Applicable Earnout EBITDA, the Indemnification
Representative shall have reasonable access to the books and
records (including financial statements) of the Surviving Corporation during
regular business hours for the purpose of verifying Buyers computation of
the Applicable Earnout EBITDA and the Applicable Earnout Amount for such
Earnout Period. Solely for the purpose of clarification, the 2007 Earnout
Amount and the 2008 Earnout Amount A will be computed after the completion of
the audited financial statements of Buyer for its fiscal year ending December
31, 2007 and the 2008 Earnout Amount B shall be computed after the completion
of the audited financial statements of Buyer for its fiscal year ending
December 31, 2008.

  

#### (ii) The parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute and,
if the parties so resolve all disputes, the computation of the Applicable
Earnout EBITDA, as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution
of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If the
parties do not reach agreement in resolving the dispute within 30 days after
notice is given by the Indemnification Representative to the Buyer pursuant
to Section 1.8(b)(i) above, the parties shall submit the dispute to a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm which is mutually agreeable
to the parties (the "Earnout Arbiter") for resolution.  If the parties
cannot agree on the selection of an independent accounting firm to act as the
Earnout Arbiter, the parties shall request the American Arbitration
Association to appoint such firm, and such appointment shall be conclusive
and binding on the parties.  Promptly, but no later than 20 days after
acceptance of his or her appointment as Earnout Arbiter, the Earnout Arbiter
shall determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the
Earnout Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator),
based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the Indemnification
Representative, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
and shall render a written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the
resulting computation of the Applicable Earnout Amount, which shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. All proceedings conducted by the
Earnout Arbiter shall take place in Boston, Massachusetts. In resolving any
disputed item, the Earnout Arbiter (x) shall be bound by the provisions of
this Section 1.8(b)(ii) and (y) may not assign a value to

     

   

#### the Applicable Earnout Amount greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Earnout Arbiter
shall be equally allocated to and borne by the Buyer and the
Company Stockholders.

  

#### (iii) The Applicable Earnout Amount shall be paid to the Company
Stockholders and the Optionholders as follows: (A) as to any amounts that are
not subject to dispute as set forth in a notice of the Indemnification
Representative pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(ii) above, within a reasonable time
after the expiration of the time during which the Indemnification
Representative may object to the Buyers calculation of the Applicable
Earnout Amount; and (B) as to any amounts that are subject to dispute as set
forth in a notice of the Indemnification Representative pursuant to Section
1.8(b)(ii) above, within five (5) business days following the date that the
determination of the disputed portion of the Applicable Earnout Amount shall
become binding and conclusive in accordance with Sections 1.8(b)(i)
or 1.8(b)(ii) above, as the case may be.

  

### (c) _Operation of Surviving Corporation_. During the Earnout Period, the
Surviving Corporation shall be operated (i) in a commercially reasonable
manner that balances the short-term earnings and long-term growth of the
Company; (ii) in a manner reasonably similar to its operations in 2006
and (iii) consistent with the assumptions underlying the projections
prepared by the Company for the Earnout Period.  In particular:

  

#### (i) The Surviving Corporation shall be maintained and accounted for as a
free-standing subsidiary of the Buyer and not combined with any other current
or future business operations of Buyer or its other subsidiaries.

  

#### (ii) The business and affairs of the Surviving Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of Michael McGowan (or, if Michael McGowan
ceases to be employed by the Surviving Corporation during 2007, such other
person appointed by Buyer following good faith consultation with the
Indemnification Representative), who shall (i) report directly to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Buyer and (ii) have authority and discretion to run
and operate the business of the Surviving Corporation in a manner consistent
with the operation of the business of the Company during the 12-month period
prior to the Closing, including making strategic and operating decisions
affecting the business and affairs of the Surviving Corporation.

  

#### (iii) The Buyer shall not take any action that will materially increase
the SGandA expenses of the Surviving Corporation in the aggregate without the
prior written consent of the President of the Surviving Corporation, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, no consent will be required if an appropriate adjustment is made to
negate the impact of such expense on the Applicable Earnout EBITDA. For
purposes of this Section 1.8, "material" shall mean any amount in excess of
$250,000.

  

#### (iv) To the extent that the Buyer requires the Surviving Corporation to
incur additional SGandA expenses that in the aggregate are material and it
would not otherwise incur, an increase shall be made to the Applicable
Earnout EBITDA equal to the amount of such amount in excess of $250,000. To
the extent that the Buyer requires the Surviving Corporation

     

   

#### to incur additional SGandA expenses unrelated to the Companys business,
an increase shall be made to the Applicable Earnout EBITDA. For purposes of
clarification only, it would be unrelated to the Companys business if,
at the request of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation adds to its
staff accountants or implements information technology systems to assist
other subsidiaries of the Buyer.

  

### (d) _Accounting_. In calculating the EBITDA of the Surviving Corporation
for purposes of this Agreement, the operations of the Surviving Corporation
shall be accounted for in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the Closing
Date, applied consistently with the Companys existing (as of the Closing
Date) accounting practices and procedures, except to the extent that any of
such accounting practices and procedures are not in compliance with GAAP as
in effect on the Closing Date. Any subsequent changes in GAAP that would
materially affect EBITDA shall not be taken into account for purposes of
calculating EBITDA for purposes of this Agreement (regardless of how
accounted for other purposes such as the Buyers SEC reporting or internal
accounting).

  

### (e) _Acceleration_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in the event that at any point prior to the end of the
Earnout Period the Buyer or any Affiliate or successor entity of the Buyer
ceases to be (either directly, or indirectly through one or more wholly owned
subsidiaries) the owner of all of the outstanding capital stock of or other
equity interests in the Surviving Corporation, then immediately upon the
occurrence of any such event, the Buyer shall irrevocably become liable to
pay, to the extent then unpaid, to the Company Stockholders and the
Optionholders the maximum 2007 Earnout Amount, 2008 Earnout Amount A and 2008
Earnout Amount B (if such event occurs in 2007) and the applicable 2007
Earnout Amount and the maximum 2008 Earnout Amount (if such event occurs in
2008).  Such 2007 Earnout Amount and the 2008 Earnout Amount shall be
delivered by the Buyer by check or wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts previously designated by the Company Stockholders and
the Optionholders.

  

### (f) _Acknowledgement._ The Buyer and the Company acknowledge: (i) the
payment of the Applicable Earnout Amount hereunder is an integral part of the
consideration to be received by the Company Stockholders and
Optionholders pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; (ii) the Applicable Earnout Amount is not dependent upon the
operating results of Buyer or any subsidiary or affiliate of Buyer; (iii) the
right of the Company Stockholders and Optionholders to a portion of the
Applicable Earnout Amount is not transferable other than by operation of law
or as otherwise provided herein; (iv) the right of the Company Stockholders
and Optionholders to a portion of the Applicable Earnout Amount shall not be
represented by a certificate or other instrument, shall not represent an
ownership interest in Buyer and shall not entitle any Company Stockholders or
Optionholders to any rights common to any holder of Buyer Common Stock; and
(v) the right of the Company Stockholders and Optionholders to payment of the
Applicable Earnout Amount shall not bear any interest except to the extent
the payment thereof by the Buyer is delayed in violation of this Agreement.

  

## 1.9 _Escrow_.

  

### (a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary shall
deposit the Escrow Cash with the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the
indemnification

     

   

### obligations of the Company Stockholders set forth in this Agreement. The
Escrow Cash shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement
pursuant to the terms thereof until the date that is 18 months following the
Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"). The Escrow Cash shall be held
as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall
be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

### (b) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of
all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the
Escrow Cash in escrow.

  

## 1.10 _Indemnification Representative_.

  

### (a) The Company Stockholders by the approval and adoption of this
Agreement appoint, authorize and empower Thomas F. Ryan (the
"Indemnification Representative") to act on behalf of each Company
Stockholder in connection with, and to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions under, this Agreement, which shall include the power and
authority (i) to make all decisions relating to the determination of any
adjustments to the Cash Consideration and the determination of the Applicable
Earnout EBITDA, (ii) to take all action necessary in connection with the
defense and/or settlement of any claims for which the Company Stockholders
may be required to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to Article VI hereof, (iii)
to give and receive all notices required to be given under the Agreement,
(iv) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement, (v) to execute and deliver
such amendments to this Agreement as the Indemnification Representative, in
his reasonable discretion, may deem necessary or desirable to give effect to
the intentions of this Agreement, and (vi) to take any and all additional
action as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the Company
Stockholders by the terms of this Agreement.

  

### (b) In the event of the death or permanent disability of the
Indemnification Representative, Adam Ryan shall serve as Indemnification
Representative. In the event of the death or permanent disability of Adam
Ryan, a successor Indemnification Representative shall be elected by a
majority vote of the Company Stockholders, with each such Company Stockholder
(or his, her or its successors or assigns) to be given a vote equal to the
number of votes represented by the shares of stock of the Company held by
such Company Stockholder immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger. Each successor Indemnification Representative shall have all of the
power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement upon the original Indemnification Representatives.

  

### (c) All decisions and actions by the Indemnification Representative,
including, without limitation, any agreement between the Indemnification
Representative and the Buyer relating to the determination of any adjustments
to the Cash Consideration and the determination of the Applicable Earnout
EBITDA, the defense or settlement of any claims for which the Company
Stockholders may be required to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to Article VI
hereof or the amendment of this Agreement shall be binding upon all of the
Company Stockholders, and no Company Stockholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

     

   

### (d) By their adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Company
Stockholders agree that:

  

#### (i) the Buyer shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Indemnification Representative as to the determination of
any adjustments to the Cash Consideration and the determination of the
Applicable Earnout EBITDA, the settlement of any claims for indemnification
by the Buyer pursuant to Article VI hereof, the amendment of this Agreement
or any other actions required to be taken by the Indemnification
Representative hereunder, and no Party hereunder shall have any cause of
action against the Buyer or the Indemnification Representative for any action
taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the
Indemnification Representative;

  

#### (ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Indemnification
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company
Stockholders, and no Company Stockholder shall have any cause of action
against the Indemnification Representative for any action taken, decision
made or instruction given by the Indemnification Representative under this
Agreement, except for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by
the Indemnification Representative;

  

#### (iii) the provisions of this Section 1.10 are independent and severable,
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Stockholder may have
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

#### (iv) remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 1.10 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer, the Indemnification
Representative and the Company shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if any such Party
brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Section 1.10; and

  

#### (v) the provisions of this Section 1.10 shall be binding upon the
executors, heirs, legal representatives and successors of each Company
Stockholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Company Stockholder or
the Company Stockholders shall mean and include the successors to the Company
Stockholders rights hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition,
the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

  

### (e) All fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnification Representative
shall be paid by the Company Stockholders in proportion to their ownership of
Company Shares.

  

## 1.11 _Currency_. All references herein to "Dollars" and amounts preceded
by a "$" shall be construed as references to United States dollars.

  

## 1.12 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_.

  

### (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety so that such Certificate of Incorporation is identical to the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Transitory Subsidiary

     

   

### immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) the name of the
corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company and
(ii) the identity of the incorporator shall be deleted.

  

### (b) The By-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall be the same as the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

  

## 1.13 _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, no
Company Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of certificates
formerly representing Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as provided herein or by law.

  

## 1.14 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company
Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, certificates
formerly representing Company Shares are presented to the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, subject to applicable law in
the case of Dissenting Shares.

  

## 1.15 _Withholding_. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Company Stockholder and any Optionholder such amounts as the Buyer
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax provision,
with respect to the making of such payment.  To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholders or
Optionholders, as applicable, in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Buyer.

  

## 1.16 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of the Company Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of the Buyer.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Shares as of the Closing Date who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the Buyer Common Stock Price.

taxable periods with respect to which the applicable statute of limitations

examination reports and statements of deficiencies of past Subsidiaries
filed, agreed to, or assessed after the date such entity was no longer a
Subsidiary). No deficiencies for Taxes of the Company have been claimed,
proposed or assessed in writing by any taxing or other governmental

are closed by the applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years
through the taxable years specified for such Tax Returns in Section 2.9(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule. No examination or audit or, to the knowledge of the
Company, other action of or relating to any Tax Return of the Company by any
Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened or contemplated. The Company has not been informed in
writing, and has not otherwise been made aware, by any jurisdiction in which
the Company did not file a Tax Return that the jurisdiction believes that the
Company was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed, or is subject
to Tax in that

such employees, consultants or directors to any payment or benefit; (ii)
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any such employee,
consultant or director; or (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of
payment of any compensation, equity award or other benefit.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in
combination with another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will result

payment is considered to be reasonable compensation for services rendered).

policies and procedures, the Company shall permit representatives of the
Buyer (including legal and tax counsel) to have full access (at all
reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal

tax and accounting records (including the work papers of the
Companys independent accountants; provided that such accountants form of
access letter or other reasonably requested documentation has been executed),
contracts, other records and documents, and personnel, of or pertaining to

Closing Date were directors or officers of the Company (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company at any time prior
to the Closing Date. The Buyer agrees that all rights of the Indemnitees to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.  Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless
such modification is required by law. In addition, the Buyer shall pay any
expenses of any Indemnitee under this Section 4.7, as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, provided that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the
extent required by applicable law.

  

### (b) The Buyer, from and after the Closing Date, shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of certain liabilities of directors and officers
and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company.

  

### (c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
covering acts or omissions occurring prior to

     

   

### the Closing Date with respect to those persons who are currently covered
by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Companys
directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance company
the terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to
such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required
under this Section 4.7(c).

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 4.7: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

  

### (e) In the event that the Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Buyer shall assume all of the
obligations of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
set forth in this Section 4.7.

  

### (f) The obligations of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, under this Section 4.7 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 4.7
applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 4.7 applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 4.7).

prior to the Closing, repay all principal and interest owed to Bank of
America pursuant to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated December
22, 2004, as amended on December 27, 2005, by and between the Company and
Fleet National Bank, a Bank of America Company (the "Company Debt").  Such
repaid Company Debt shall not be reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. If
there is cash on the Closing Balance Sheet, it shall not be included in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital and shall be paid to the Company
Stockholders by the Company as soon after the Closing as is reasonably
practicable.

  

## 4.9 _Employment Matters_.

  

### (a) _Employee Benefits_. Each individual who is an employee of
the Company immediately prior to the Closing shall continue as an employee of
the Company immediately after the Closing (each, a " _Continuing Employee_
"). For a period of no less than one year from and after the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Company or one of their
respective Affiliates to provide, to each Continuing Employee, health and
welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than such
Continuing Employees health and welfare benefits immediately prior to
the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 4.9,
"health and welfare" benefits shall not include any cash or equity
compensation.

   

36

eligibility to participate and vesting and benefit level (but not accrual)
where length of service is relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement in
which any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate, Continuing
Employees shall receive service credit for service with the Company and its
affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the same extent such service credit
was granted under comparable Company Plans. The Buyer shall (i) cause to be
waived all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the plan year including
the Closing Date, in satisfaction of any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements.

  

### (c) _No Third-Party Rights; No Right to Continued Employment_.  No
provision of this Section 4.9 shall create any third-party beneficiary or
other rights in any Continuing Employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of (i) continued employment (or
resumed employment) with the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates,
or (ii) any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any
Company Plans or any similar plan or arrangement which may be established or
maintained by the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. No provision
of this Section 4.9 shall obligate the Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates to adopt or maintain any benefit plan at any time.

  

## 4.10 _Stock Options_.

  

### (a) _Company Vested Stock Options_. The Company shall take such action
as shall be necessary or advisable pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and
any applicable Option agreements, including without limitation, obtaining any
necessary consents, to cause each Company Vested Stock Option that
remains outstanding as of the Effective Time to be cancelled and extinguished
as of the Effective Time and to represent thereafter solely the right to
receive the consideration provided for in Section 1.5(c)(ii) hereof and to no
longer represent the right to purchase Company Shares or any other equity
security of the Company or the Buyer.

  

### (b) _Company Unvested Stock Options_. The Company shall take such action
as shall be necessary or advisable pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and

the Effective Time, such that such Unvested Company Stock Options shall not
be entitled to any portion of the Merger Consideration or any other
consideration.

  

### (c) _Assumption of Shares Under Certain Company Stock Plans_.  Buyer
shall, effective at the Effective Time, assume the Companys Amended and
Restated 2001 Share Incentive Plan and the Companys Amended and Restated

## 4.11 _FIRPTA Tax Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, (i) the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer and to the Internal Revenue Service notices that
the Company Shares are not "U.S. real property interests" in accordance with
Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code, or (ii) each of
the Company Stockholders shall deliver to the Buyer certifications that

     

   

## they are not foreign persons in accordance with the Treasury Regulations
under Section 1445 of the Code, in either case, together with authorization
for Buyer to deliver such notices or certifications to the Internal Revenue
Service upon the Closing. If the Buyer does not receive either the notices or
the certifications described above on or before the Closing Date in form and
substance sufficient to assure the Buyer that it has satisfied
its obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), along with
such authorization, the Buyer shall be permitted to withhold from the
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding tax
under Section 1445 of the Code.

  

## 4.12 _S Corporation Status_. The Company and the Company
Stockholders shall not revoke the Companys election to be taxed as an S

### (a) _Timing_. The Buyer shall file with the SEC, within five business
days following the preparation of the Companys financial statements required

expenses or liabilities to which such Company Stockholder

     

   

### may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Stockholder Registration Statement or any omission to state
therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

such representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made
as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition. During
the same period, each Party will promptly notify the other Party of the
occurrence of any breach of any covenant of such Party or of the occurrence

## 4.17 _Tax Matters_.

  

### (a) _Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

  

#### (i) After giving effect to any valid extensions of the due date, the
Indemnification Representative shall prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed) in a timely manner the Income Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and will timely pay (or
cause to be paid), all Taxes shown as due and owing on all such Tax Returns.
All such Tax Returns shall be signed by KPMG or another major accounting
firm, and the Company Stockholders will pay the expenses of such accounting
firm except for amounts accrued as liabilities on the Closing Balance Sheet
and taken into account as such in the calculation of Closing Working Capital.
The Buyer shall cooperate with the preparation of such Tax returns and
provide all information reasonably required and shall be permitted at least
30 days to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing. The Indemnification Representative shall
cooperate with such review and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns
as are reasonably requested by the Buyer. Any disputes over such Tax Returns
shall be promptly submitted to and resolved by an independent accounting firm
selected jointly by the Buyer and the Indemnification Representative. The
Buyer will reimburse the Company Stockholders for any Taxes with respect to
such Tax Returns to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the reserve
for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of
the balance sheet in the Companys Financial Statements (rather than in any
notes thereto), whether as accrued Taxes or other accrued expenses, and taken
into account as liabilities in calculating Closing Working Capital. The Buyer
will prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) in a timely manner
all other Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are
filed after the Closing Date (after giving effect to any valid extensions of
the due date). Buyer shall permit the Indemnification Representative to
review and comment on each such Tax Return

     

   

#### described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Indemnification Representative. Any disputes over such Tax Returns shall be
promptly submitted to and resolved by an independent accounting firm selected
jointly by the Buyer and the Indemnification Representative. The Company
Stockholders shall pay to the Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the date
on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to such
Taxes of the Company for such periods, except to the extent that such Taxes
are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) shown on the face of the balance sheet in the Companys Financial
Statements (rather than in any notes thereto), whether as accrued Taxes or
other accrued expenses, and taken into account as liabilities in calculating
Closing Working Capital.

  

#### (ii) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed any Tax Returns of the Company for Straddle
Periods. The Company Stockholders shall pay to Buyer within fifteen (15) days
after the date on which any such Taxes are paid with respect to such periods
an amount equal to the portion of Straddle Period Taxes which relates to the
portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date, except to the
extent that such Taxes are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the balance sheet in the
Companys Financial Statements (rather than in any notes thereto), whether as
accrued Taxes or other accrued expenses, and taken into account as
liabilities in calculating Closing Working Capital.

  

#### (iii) In the case of any Straddle Period Taxes, the portion of such Tax
that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of non-income based Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
(including property Taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii)
in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed
in connection with any sale or transfer of property (be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended at the close
of the Closing Date.

  

#### (iv) To the extent required by applicable law, each of the Company
Stockholders shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax
items for Pre-Closing Tax Periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Companys Schedule K-1s for such Tax Periods (including any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) elections contemplated hereunder).

  

#### (v) Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed by the Buyer for taxable
periods beginning before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return except to the extent
Buyer makes a good faith determination that a position or other method of
reporting in such Tax Return is not reasonably likely to be sustained upon
audit, and the Buyer shall consult with the Indemnification Representative
concerning each such Tax Return and report all items with respect to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date in accordance with the
instructions of the Indemnification Representative to the

     

   

#### extent such reporting is allowable without significant risk of the
imposition of penalties or additions to Tax as determined by the Buyer in
consultation with its Tax advisors. The Buyer shall provide the
Indemnification Representative with a copy of each such proposed Tax Return
(and such additional information regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably
be requested by the Indemnification Representative) at least 30 days prior to
the filing of such Tax Return, except that (i) in the case of a Tax Return
relating to a monthly taxable period, the copy shall be provided to the
Indemnification Representative at least 5 days prior to the filing of such
Tax Return and (ii) in the case of a Tax Return due within 90 days following
the Closing Date, the copy shall be provided to the Indemnification
Representative in such shorter period of time prior to filing as the Buyer
shall reasonably determine to be practicable.

  

### (b) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_.

  

#### (i) If the Company is permitted, but not required, under applicable
foreign, state or local Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
a taxable period, such day shall be treated as the last day of a taxable
period.

  

#### (ii) The Company Stockholders shall be entitled to all refunds, if any,
attributable to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods,
to the extent related to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date, other than refunds of (a) Taxes directly or indirectly paid by
Buyer, except for (1) Taxes reflected in the reserve for Tax liability
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the balance
sheet in the Companys Financial Statements (rather than in any notes
thereto), whether as accrued Taxes or other accrued expenses, and taken into
account as liabilities in calculating Closing Working Capital and (2) Taxes
for which the Company Stockholders have indemnified the Buyer; (b) Taxes
reflected as assets or a reduction of liabilities on the Companys Financial
Statements and taken into account as assets or a reduction of liabilities in
calculating Closing Working Capital; and (c) Taxes the refund of which would
increase the Companys or the Buyers Taxes in any period to the extent the
Buyer is not indemnified by the Company Stockholders for such increased
Taxes.  The Buyer shall, if the Company Stockholders so request and at
the Company Stockholders sole expense, reasonably cooperate with the
Company Stockholders to obtain and expedite any claim for (and any receipt
of) any refund to which the Company Stockholders are entitled under this
section.

  

#### (iii) All transfer, documentary, sales, use stamp, registration and
other similar Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be paid
equally by the Buyer and Company Stockholders when due. The Buyer will file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes, fees and charges and, if required by applicable law, the Company
Stockholders will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Any expenses incurred in making such filings shall be paid
equally by the Buyer and the Company Stockholders.

  

#### (iv) All powers of attorney, Tax sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated
prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not
be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect
of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

     

   

#### (c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  

#### (i) The Buyer, the Company, the Indemnification Representative and the
Company Stockholders shall cooperate in (i) the preparation of all Tax
Returns for any Tax periods and (ii) the conduct of any Tax Proceeding, in
each case for which one party could reasonably require the assistance of the
other party in obtaining any necessary information. Such cooperation
shall include, but not be limited to, furnishing prior years Tax Returns or
return preparation packages illustrating previous reporting practices or
containing historical information relevant to the preparation of such Tax
Returns, and furnishing such other information within such partys possession
requested by the other party as is relevant to the preparation of the Tax
Returns or the conduct of the Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and
information also shall include promptly forwarding copies of appropriate
notices and forms or other communications received from or sent to any
Governmental Entity which relate to the Company, and providing copies of all
relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and
related workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
any Governmental Entity and records concerning the ownership and tax basis
of property, which the requested party may possess. The Buyer and the
Indemnification Representative further agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

#### (ii) The Buyer and the Indemnification Representative will promptly
notify the other party in writing of any proposed assessment or claim or the
commencement of any Tax Proceeding which, if determined adversely, could
result in a liability to the Company Stockholders, the Buyer, or the Company,
as applicable, under this Agreement or which could cause an adjustment in the
Tax liability of Company Stockholders, the Buyer, or the Company. In the case
of a Tax Proceeding that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
Company Stockholders will have the right at their own expense to control the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding, including settling or compromising the issue
or matter except if such settlement or compromise affects the Tax liability
of the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period or any portion of a Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date (or for any other Tax period to the
extent that the Company Stockholders are not obligated to indemnify the
Company or the Buyer under this Agreement), in which case no settlement or
compromise shall be made without the prior written consent of the Buyer,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Company Stockholders elect
to control such Tax Proceeding, the Company Stockholders shall, within 30
days of becoming aware of any Tax Proceeding, notify the Buyer of the Company
Stockholders intent to do so, and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate and
shall cause the Company to reasonably cooperate in each phase of the Tax
Proceeding. If the Company Stockholders elect not to control such Tax
Proceeding, the Buyer or the Company, as applicable, may assume control of
such Tax Proceeding (at Buyers expense); provided, however, in such case,
the Buyer shall, upon reasonable request, provide the Indemnification
Representative with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of
the Tax Proceeding, and neither the Buyer nor the Company may settle or
compromise any asserted liability that would adversely affect the Tax
liability of the Company Stockholders without the prior written consent of
the Indemnification Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     

   

#### (iii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to any Straddle
Period, the Buyer will have the right at its own expense to control the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding, including settling or compromising the issue
or matter except if such settlement or compromise affects the Tax liability
of the Company Stockholders for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any portion of
a Straddle Period before and up to the Closing Date, in which case no
settlement or compromise shall be made without the prior written consent of
the Indemnification Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

#### (iv) Except as required by law, the Buyer and the Company Stockholders
shall not take, nor shall the Buyer cause or permit the Company to take, any
action or omit to take any action (other than actions specifically
contemplated hereby) which could increase the liability of the other party in
connection with any Taxes under this Agreement. Neither the Buyer nor
any Affiliate thereof shall amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or
permit the Company to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or
Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of the Company Stockholders, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

  

### (d) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  

#### (i) The Company and each of the Company Stockholders will join with the
Buyer in making an irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any corresponding election under state, local and foreign Tax Law) with
respect to the Buyers acquisition of the Company Shares hereunder
(collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). The Company, each of the
Company Stockholders and the Buyer shall be jointly responsible for preparing
and timely filing any forms used to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election,
including the joint preparation and filing of IRS Form 8023 and related
schedules and such additional forms, returns, elections, schedules and other
documents as may be required) to effect, perfect and preserve such Section
338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (or any comparable provisions of

filed timely following the Closing Date.  The Company and the Company
Stockholders shall duly complete and execute prior to or at the Closing all
federal, state and other forms used to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election
requiring their signatures, which forms shall be held in escrow by Latham and
Watkins LLP (with copies to Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP) and
thereafter filed by the Buyer and the Company Stockholders as described in
the preceding sentence. The Company and the Company Stockholders will provide
Buyer with any information regarding the Company as is necessary for the
Buyer to complete IRS Form 8883 and any supplements thereto. The Buyer shall
complete Form 8883 taking into account the allocation schedule prepared
pursuant to Section 4.17(d)(ii). The Buyer will provide a copy of
the completed Form 8883 to the Company and the Company Stockholders. The
Buyer shall be responsible for filing the Form 8883 with the appropriate Tax
Returns.  The Buyer and the Stockholders agree not to take any action that
could cause such Section 338(h)(10) Election to be invalid, shall report the
Merger as an asset sale by an S corporation consistent with such Section
338(h)(10) Election, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless
required pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any similar provision of state, foreign or local law.

     

   

#### (ii) For Tax purposes, the Purchase Price and assumed liabilities (and
all other capitalizable costs) shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company in accordance with _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the "Allocation
Schedule"), to which the parties have agreed and which is intended in all
respects to comply with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable provisions of
state, local or other Tax law. Except to the extent otherwise required
by applicable laws, the Buyer, the Company, and the Company Stockholders will
make all Tax Returns, reports, forms, declarations, claims and other
statements in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule (including any
supplemental filings reflecting the earnout payments required in Section 1.8
hereto) and will not make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any
returns or during the course of any Tax audit or other proceeding relating to
Taxes.

  

## 4.18 _Financial Statements_. The Company agrees to reasonably
cooperate with Buyer, with regard to any filings required by the Buyer with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and revise or prepare any financial
statements, including the Financial Statements, required to be included in
any such filing in a form appropriate for such filing (including compliance
with Regulation S-X), and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any consents of independent accounting firms required in connection
therewith; provided, however, that the Buyer agrees to reimburse the Company
on or prior to Closing (or otherwise make an appropriate adjustment in the
Closing Working Capital Statement) for any third-party expenses incurred by
the Company prior to Closing with respect to such preparation or revision in
excess of the amount of the audit fees in connection with Companys 2006
financial statements.

  

## 4.19 _Real Property Leases_. The Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide all notices and obtain all
consents required under any Lease to which the Company is a party prior to

with respect to the provision of such notices and the obtainment of such
consents.

  

## 4.20 _Company Unvested Stock Options_. The Company agrees to satisfy any
obligations related to, or in connection with, the cancellation of any
Company Unvested Stock Option.

  

## 4.21 _Financing_. The Buyer agrees to use its best efforts to promptly
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to a
bank financing required to obtain the standby letters of credit and repay
the promissory notes ("Financing") on substantially the terms set forth on
Schedule 4.21 and pursuant to appropriate agreements with financing sources
(the "Definitive Financing Agreements"), and if such Definitive Financing
Agreements are entered into, to consummate the Financing. The Buyer shall
use its best efforts to satisfy all requirements of the Financing (or such
replacement financing agreements that have substantially similar terms as the
Definitive Financing Agreements and in any event, no less favorable to the
Buyer than those set forth in the Definitive Financing Agreements) and of the
Definitive Financing Agreements, which are conditions precedent to
closing the transaction constituting the Financing.  The Buyer will keep the
Company informed, to the extent requested, on a regular on-going basis as to
the status of the efforts to obtain the Financing. In the event any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable in any manner or from the sources
originally contemplated, the Buyer will promptly inform the Company.

     

   

## 4.22 _Letters of Credit_. The Company agrees to cooperate with the Buyer
to enable the Buyer to substitute, backstep or replace the
Companys outstanding letters of credit on the Closing Date, which may be
pursuant to the Definitive Financing Agreements.

## 6.1 _Indemnification by the Company Stockholders_. Subject to the

jointly and severally, shall indemnify the Buyer in respect of, and hold it
harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the Surviving
Corporation or the Buyer resulting from or arising directly out of:

  

### (a) any breach, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing
Date, of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement;

  

### (b) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company
contained in this Agreement;

  

### (c) any failure of any Company Stockholder to have good, valid and

or

  

### (d) (i) any Taxes of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Period
(or for any Straddle Period, to the extent allocable to the portion of such
period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date), and (ii) any Taxes
of a Person (other than the Company) for which the Company has any liability
as of the Closing Date under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by

     

   

### contract, or otherwise, except (i) to the extent that such Taxes are
reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) shown on the face of the Companys Financial Statements (rather than
in any notes thereto), whether as accrued Taxes or other accrued expenses,
and taken into account as liabilities in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital and (ii) to the extent of interest, fines, penalties, assessments or
additions to Taxes directly attributable to Buyers failure to comply with
any Tax-related covenants in this Agreement.

  

The Buyer shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring
costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise to the Damages.

  

## 6.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. The Buyer shall indemnify the Company
Stockholders in respect of, and hold them harmless against, any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by the Company Stockholders resulting from
or arising out of:

  

### (a) any breach, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing
Date, of any representation or warranty of the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary contained in this Agreement; or

  

### (b) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary contained in this Agreement.

  

The Company Stockholders shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any
Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Damages.

  

## 6.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

  

### (a) All claims for indemnification made under this Agreement resulting
from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim against an Indemnified
Party shall be made in accordance with the following procedures.  An
Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notification to the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, including any
government inquiry, relating to a third-party claim for which indemnification
may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such claim by a third
party. Such notification shall include a description in reasonable detail (to
the extent known by the Indemnified Party) of the facts constituting the
basis for such third-party claim and the amount of the Damages claimed. No
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder
unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is thereby
prejudiced.  Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
control such defense. The Party not controlling such defense may participate
therein at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party 

     

   

### assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such action,
suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be considered
"Damages" for purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such
defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall consider
recommendations made by the other Party with respect thereto.
The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes
any liability or obligation or potential liability or obligation on the
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### (b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VI, an
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party.
 If the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and the Claim Notice is
delivered prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Indemnifying Party shall
deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent.

  

### (c) Within twenty (20) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in
which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response
shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer;
provided that if the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and the Claim Notice is
delivered prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3)
business days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice
executed by both Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the
Buyer such amount of Escrow Cash as is equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii)
agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in
which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire
transfer; provided that if the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and the Claim
Notice is delivered prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within
three (3) days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice
executed by both Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the
Buyer such amount of Escrow Cash as is equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii)
dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount.

  

### (d) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that
reflects a Dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not
resolved within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall discuss in good faith the submission of the
Dispute to binding arbitration, and if the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party agree in

     

   

### writing to submit the Dispute to such arbitration, then the provisions of
Section 6.3(e) shall become effective with respect to such Dispute. The
provisions of this Section 6.3(d) shall not obligate the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party to submit to arbitration or any other alternative
dispute resolution procedure with respect to any Dispute, and in the absence
of an agreement by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party to
arbitrate a Dispute, such Dispute shall be resolved in a state or federal
court sitting in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in accordance with
Section 9.11. If the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and the Claim Notice is
delivered prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following
the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration,
judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both Parties
instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Cash
shall be distributed to the Buyer and/or the Stockholders (which notice shall
be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

  

### (e) If, as set forth in Section 6.3(d), the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party agree to submit any Dispute to binding arbitration, the
arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") in
accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect from time to time and the
following provisions:

  

#### (i) In the event of any conflict between the Commercial Rules in effect
from time to time and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Agreement shall prevail and be controlling.

  

#### (ii) The Parties shall commence the arbitration by jointly filing a
written submission with the Boston, Massachusetts office of the AAA in
accordance with Commercial Rule 5 (or any successor provision).

  

#### (iii) Not later than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the
arbitration hearing (or such other times as all Parties to the arbitration
proceeding shall agree), the Arbitrator shall prepare and distribute to the
Parties a writing setting forth the arbitral award and the Arbitrators
reasons therefor.  Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties, and judgment thereon may be entered
and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to Section
9.11); _provided_ _that_  the Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to
(x) award damages in excess of the portion of the Claimed Amount that is
subject to such Dispute, (y) award multiple, consequential, punitive or
exemplary damages, or (z) grant injunctive relief, specific performance or
other equitable relief.

  

#### (iv) The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the
Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of
this Agreement, including the provisions of this Section 6.3(e), or (y)
address or resolve any issue not submitted by the Parties or (z) make any
award in an amount beyond the range established by the lowest and highest
formal written offers relating to the Claimed Amount that is subject to such
Dispute, if any, made by the Parties involved in such Dispute.

  

#### (v) In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this
Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses, except that the
fees and costs of the AAA and the Arbitrator, the costs and expenses of
obtaining the facility where the arbitration

     

   

#### hearing is held, and such other costs and expenses as the Arbitrator may
determine to be directly related to the conduct of the arbitration and
appropriately borne jointly by the Parties (which shall not include any
Partys attorneys fees or costs, witness fees (if any), costs of
investigation and similar expenses) shall be shared equally by
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.

  

### (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.3, if a third
party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified Party is
liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Damages for which such Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, and such Indemnified
Party reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill
such obligation and that such Indemnified Party or such third party is likely
to suffer irreparable harm if the Indemnified Party follows the procedures in
this Section 6.3, then (i) such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
satisfy such obligation, without prior consent from the Indemnifying Party
(provided that such Indemnified Party shall provide such notice to the
Indemnifying Party as is possible under the circumstances), (ii) such
Indemnified Party may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in
accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, and (iii) such Indemnified
Party shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this Article
VI, for any such Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Article VI (subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute
the Indemnified Partys entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for
which it is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this Article VI).

  

### (g) For purposes of this Section 6.3 and the second and third sentences
of Section 6.4, (i) if the Stockholders comprise the Indemnifying Party, any
references to the Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an
obligation to make any payments) shall be deemed to refer to the
Indemnification Representative, and (ii) if the Stockholders comprise the
Indemnified Party, any references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) shall
be deemed to refer to the Indemnification Representative. The
Indemnification Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf
of each Stockholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and
all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of,
the Stockholders under this Article VI. The Indemnification Representative
shall have no liability to any Stockholder for any action taken or omitted on
behalf of the Stockholders pursuant to this Article VI.

  

## 6.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.2, and the indemnification
obligations relating thereto, as well as claims for indemnification under
Section 6.1(c), shall survive the Closing indefinitely. The representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 2.9 and 2.19(d), and
the indemnification obligations relating thereto, as well as claims
for indemnification under Section 6.1(d), shall (a) survive the Closing
and (b) survive through and until the date on which the applicable statute
of limitations expires. All other representations and warranties of the
Parties set forth in this Agreement, and the indemnification obligations
relating thereto, shall (a) survive the Closing and (b) expire on April 1,
2008. If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before
expiration of a representation or warranty, a Claim Notice based upon a
breach of such representation or warranty, then the applicable representation
or warranty shall survive

     

   

## until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by
such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which a
Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the
Indemnifying Party; and if the Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the
Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent and Escrow Cash has been retained in escrow
after the termination date set forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to
such Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by
both Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such retained Escrow
Cash to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  

## 6.5 _Limitations_.

judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the
court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have
the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

  

## 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the
jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this

Dispute hereunder), (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) waives
any claim of inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such court,
(d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement in any other court and (e) waives any right it may have to

relating to this Agreement; provided in each case that, solely with respect
to any arbitration of a Dispute, the Arbitrator shall resolve all threshold
issues relating to the validity and applicability of the arbitration
provisions of this Agreement, contract validity, applicability of statutes of
limitations and issue preclusion, and such threshold issues shall not be
heard or determined by such court. Each Party agrees to accept service of
any summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner provided
for the giving of notices in Section 9.7, provided that nothing in this
Section 9.11 shall affect the right of any Party to serve such summons,
complaint or other initial pleading in any other manner permitted by law.

### (a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Party.

     

   

### (b) Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated

refer to an Article, Section or paragraph of this Agreement, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.

  

## 9.13 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably if any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Parties
will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
its terms and provisions in any Legal Proceeding instituted in any court of
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties
