borrowed money and interest thereon and Closing Costs, to the extent included
in the calculation of the Merger Consideration; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | for purposes of calculating the allowance for doubtful
accounts, any account that is more than 30 days past due shall be reserved
100%, _provided, however_ , that if any such account is collected within 90
days after the Closing Date, the Closing Adjustment shall be increased by the

---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the following elements of the Final Closing Adjustment shall
be prorated as set forth in the Closing Statement (without double counting any
provisions otherwise reflected in the calculation of the Closing Adjustment),
with the expense or revenue for the account of Wexford Equities to the extent

Tenant Charges for the period of time through the Closing Date shall be
reconciled against actual charges and expenses for such period. Other than as
set forth above, there shall not be any further reconciliation of Tenant
Charges, the proration of such Tenant Charges pursuant to the final
reconciliation being conclusively deemed accurate. 
---|---|--- 
 



28 (b) The Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the parties unless
Wexford Equities shall, within 60 days following its receipt thereof,
together with all such reasonable supporting documentation, deliver to Parent
written notice of disagreement with the Closing Statement, which notice shall
describe the nature of any such disagreement, identify the specific items
involved and the dollar amount of each such disagreement. If Wexford Equities
shall raise any objections within the aforesaid 60 day period, then the
disputed matters shall be resolved by Wexford Equities and Parent. If Wexford
Equities and Parent are unable to resolve all disagreements within 30 days of
receipt by Parent of a written notice of disagreement, or such longer period
as may be agreed by Parent and Wexford Equities, then Wexford Equities and
Parent jointly shall contact a nationally recognized certified public
accounting firm that has not performed accounting, tax or auditing services
for Parent, Wexford Equities, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates during the past three years to serve as the "Accounting
Arbitrator." The Accounting Arbitrator will consider only those items and
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement as to which Parent and Wexford
Equities have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified
above and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions
of this Agreement. In submitting a dispute to the Accounting Arbitrator, each
of the parties shall concurrently furnish, at its own expense, to the
Accounting Arbitrator and the other party such documents and information as
the Accounting Arbitrator may request. Each party may also furnish to the
Accounting Arbitrator such other information and documents as it deems
relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other party. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall issue a written report that sets forth the resolution of all
items in dispute and that contains a final Closing Statement. The report
shall be final and binding upon Parent, Wexford Equities and the Surviving
Company. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator incurred in
connection with the determination of the disputed items by the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne by (A) Parent if the Accounting Arbitrators
determination of the disputed items shall vary from Parents determination of
the disputed items by more than the difference between Wexford Equities
determination of the disputed items and the Accounting Arbitrators
determination of the disputed items or (B) Wexford Equities if the Accounting
Arbitrators determination of the disputed items shall vary from
Wexford Equities determination of the disputed items by more than the
difference between Parents determination of the disputed items and the
Accounting Arbitrators determination of the disputed items. Parent and
Wexford Equities shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate fully with the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis
to all requests for information or access to documents or personnel made by
the Accounting Arbitrator or by other parties hereto, all with the intent to
fairly and in good faith resolve all disputes relating to the Closing
Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable.

(c) After the Closing Statement has been finally determined in accordance with
this Section 3.05, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) If the Final Closing Adjustment is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment, the Merger Consideration shall be decreased on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount of such shortfall. If the Final Closing Adjustment
is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjustment, the Merger Consideration
shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such
excess. 

 



29 (ii) If the Construction and Development Costs are less than the Estimated
Construction and Development Costs, the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such shortfall. If the
Construction and Development Costs are greater than the Estimated Construction
and Development Costs, the Merger Consideration shall be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess.

(iii) If the Debt Payoff Amount is less than the Estimated Debt Payoff
Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the amount of such shortfall. If the Debt Payoff Amount is greater
than the Estimated Debt Payoff Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess.

(iv) If the Assumed Debt Amount is less than the Estimated Assumed Debt
Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the amount of such shortfall. If the Assumed Debt Amount is greater
than the Estimated Assumed Debt Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess.

(v) If the Closing Costs are less than the Estimated Closing Costs, the
Merger Consideration shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
amount of such shortfall. If the Closing Costs are greater than the Estimated
Closing Costs, the Merger Consideration shall be decreased on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount of such excess.

(d) If the adjustments described in Section 3.05(c) result in an aggregate
reduction in the Merger Consideration, Parent shall be entitled to the amount
of such reduction, which amount shall be paid by Wexford Equities to Parent in
cash within five Business Days after the final determination of the Closing
Statement.

(e) If the adjustments described in Section 3.05(c) result in an aggregate
increase in the Merger Consideration, Wexford Equities shall be entitled to
the amount of such increase, which such amount shall be paid by Parent to
Wexford Equities, to be disbursed by Wexford Equities as paying agent in
accordance with Section 2.06(b), within five Business Days after the final
determination of the Closing Statement.

 

Section 3.06 Tax Withholding. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Parent determines in good faith that Parent is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

 

Section 3.07 Tax Allocation. The parties shall determine in good faith the
allocation of the Merger Consideration, and such agreed upon allocation shall
be documented by the parties prior to Closing. The parties shall make
consistent use of such allocation for all Tax purposes and in all filings
with, and declarations and reports to, all Governmental Authorities. In any
Action relating to the determination of any Tax, no party shall contest such
allocation or assert such allocation is not correct.

 



30 Section 3.08 Escrow. On the Closing Date, Parent shall withhold from
the Merger Consideration and deposit with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), the Escrow Amount. The
Escrow Amount shall be held pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement,
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow
Agreement"), as security for the indemnification obligations of Wexford
Equities set forth in Article VIII. In the event Parent (or a related
Indemnified Party) suffers any Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification under Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover such Losses, subject to Section 8.04, first, from the Escrow Amount.
Once the Escrow Amount has been exhausted, or the Escrow Agreement has
expired or otherwise been terminated, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to recover such Losses, subject to Section 8.04, by pursuing such remedies as
may be available to the Indemnified Party hereunder.

except for Permitted Encumbrances. Neither the Company nor any of the Related

notice that any Permit, Contract, easement or other right that is necessary

of egress and ingress to and from the Company Real Properties is not in full
force and effect, except for such failures to be in full force and effect that

Lease, (2) no event has occurred which would result in a breach or violation
of, or a default under, any Lease by the Company or any of the Related

of the Company or any of the Related Entities has been made available to

copies of all current surveys in the possession of the Company or any Related
Entity, and relating to the Company Real Property, have been made available to

(i) The Company and the Related Entities have good and valid title to, or a
valid and enforceable leasehold interest in, or other right to use, all
personal property owned, used or held for use by them as of the date of this
Agreement (other than property owned by tenants and used or held in connection
with the applicable tenancy), except as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
None of the Companys or any of the Related Entities ownership of or
leasehold interest in any such personal property is subject to any
Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

(j) Section 4.07(j) of the Disclosure Schedules lists (i) each Company Real
Property that is under construction and/or development (including major
refurbishing or reconstruction, but excluding any tenant improvement work for
a tenant under a Lease) as of the date hereof (each, a "Development
Property"), (ii) all properties, other than Development Properties, currently
proposed for acquisition, development or commencement of construction prior to
the Closing Date by the Company and each Related Entity pursuant to binding
Contracts (each, a "Planned Development Property"), and (iii) certain other
projects on which the Company and the Related Entities are bidding or
otherwise actively attempting to secure the right to develop (each, a
"Potential Development Property"). Section 4.07(j) of the Disclosure
Schedules identifies each general contractor or project architect for such
Development Property who is in privity with the Company or any of the Related
Entities and any subcontractor performing work in excess of $500,000 in the

copy of each Development Agreement has been made available to Parent in the
Data Room. The Company and the Related Entities have obtained all Permits and
Existing Entitlements in connection with the construction and development of
each Development Property, including all utilities, driveways, roads and other
means of egress and ingress to and from any such Development Property as
necessary, taking into account the stage of construction and development and
the lawful use and operation thereof upon completion of each such Development
Property. Neither the Company nor any of the Related Entities has received
written notice from any Governmental Authority or other third party of any
violation of Law or other claim which would prevent the completion of the
construction and development of any Development Property as contemplated
by the applicable Development Agreements and the Company Budget.

 



38 (k) The material Improvements on each parcel of Company Real Property
(excluding the Planned Development Property) have legal, physical and valid
access to (and with respect to each Development Property, the Company
anticipates such Development Property having such access upon completion
thereof) such sewer, water, gas, electric, telephone and other utilities and
all driveways, roads and other means of egress and ingress to and from any of
the Company Real Properties (excluding the Planned Development Property) as
are necessary to allow the business operated thereon for its current use (or,
with respect to each Development Property, for its contemplated use during
construction and upon completion thereof), except where the failure to have
such access, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no existing latent structural, geological or other physical defect or
deficiency in the condition of any Company Real Property (excluding the
Planned Development Property), or any component or portion thereof, that is
reasonably likely to impair or impose material costs upon the use, occupancy
or operation of such Company Real Property (excluding the Planned Development
Properties), and that has not been (or is not being) corrected. Each Company
Real Property (excluding the Planned Development Properties) has sufficient
parking or rights to parking that complies with all applicable Law (including
variances and legal non-conforming approvals) except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except to the extent the Company or the Related
Entities have legal and binding rights to any such facilities, building system
or utilities, each of the Company Real Properties (other than the Development
Properties or Planned Development Properties) is an independent property that
does not rely on any facilities (other than public facilities, public roads
and off-site parking) located on any real property which is not a Company
Real Property to fulfill any requirement of any Governmental Authority or for
the furnishing to such Company Real Property (other than the Development
Properties or Planned Development Properties) of any essential building
system or utility, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(l) Except as set forth on Section 4.07(l) of the Disclosure Schedules, as of
the date of this Agreement no casualty to the Company Real Property with
respect to which the costs of restoration, repair or replacement could
reasonably be expected to exceed $500,000 or the time reasonably required to
complete such restoration, repair or replacement would exceed 180 days has
occurred with respect to which repairs or restoration has not been completed
in material compliance with all applicable Laws and ordinances.

(m) To the Companys Knowledge, the Company or the applicable Related Entity
has all Entitlements necessary for the Companys and the Related Entities
current usage of each Company Real Property (other than the Development
Properties and Planned Development Properties) and for the commencement of
development of each Development Property (collectively, the "Existing
Entitlements"). All of the Existing Entitlements are vested in the Company or
the applicable Related Entity, and will not be affected by the consummation
of the Merger or the Related Entity Transfers. To the Companys Knowledge,
there are no material uncured defaults or breaches under any of the Existing
Entitlements. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no current adverse
actions, challenges or proceedings by any third party or Governmental
Authority with respect to the Existing Entitlements. Neither the Company nor
any of the Related Entities has received written notice of any adverse changes
to any of the Existing Entitlements.

 



39 (n) The Company reasonably believes that all Entitlements necessary to permit
the full development and usage of the Development Properties, in a manner and
in a time period materially consistent with the Development Agreements and the
Company Budget, have been obtained or will be obtained on a timely basis in
the ordinary course of business, and to the Companys Knowledge, there are no
current adverse actions, challenges or proceedings by any third party or
Governmental Authority with respect to any such Entitlements.

 

(o) Neither the Company nor any Related Entity has received notice that the
use being made of each Company Real Property is not in conformity with the

have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Related
Entities owns or licenses any patents, patent applications or copyrights.
Neither the Company nor any of the Related Entities has entered into a co-
existence or similar Contract with respect to the name "Wexford."

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to constitute a Material
Adverse Effect, the Companys and the Related Entities conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted does not infringe, violate or
misappropriate the intellectual property of any Person, and no Person is
infringing, violating or misappropriating any material intellectual property
of the Company or the Related Entities. Neither the Company nor any of the
Related Entities has received any written notice claiming that the Companys
or the Related Entities intellectual property, or the operation of their
business, infringes, conflicts with, misappropriates, interferes with, dilutes
or otherwise violates the rights of any Person in or to any intellectual
property.

adequate access to the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and
records, and other documents and data of the Company for such purpose. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that: (a) in making its decision to enter into this

relied solely upon its own investigation and the express

 



48  representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV of
this Agreement (including the related portions of the Disclosure Schedules);

Section 856(a)), or (iii) another entity described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.48-4(a)(1)(v); _provided, however_ , that such properties will not
be subject to recapture or fail to qualify for such tax credits if any Person
related to Parent is a real estate investment trust and the properties are
held directly by an entity treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (as defined in
Code Section 856(l)) of such Person.

Section 5.09 SEC Documents. General Partners and Parents Annual Report on

definitive proxy statements or information statements required to be filed
or furnished by General Partner or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries

as amended, (i) complied as to form with the applicable requirements under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made

be, of the entity or entities to which such statement relates for the periods
to which it relates, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except in each case as may be noted therein,
subject to normal year end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited
financial statements. Except for those liabilities that are fully reflected or
reserved against in the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet of
General Partner and its Subsidiaries contained in the Parent 2012 Form 10-K
and, except for liabilities reflected in Parent SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof or incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices or in connection with this Agreement, since December 31, 2012,

obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
required by GAAP to be set forth on its consolidated

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on General Partners,
Parents or Merger Subs ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

of General Partner and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary

effective, the Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading; _provided, however,_ that the
representations

 



50  and warranties in this Section 5.13 shall not apply to statements in or
omissions from the Registration Statement made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to General Partner and/or
Parent by Wexford Equities or its Affiliates expressly for use therein.

Ted Russell, Vice President, Director of Investment Banking, or such other
individuals as the Company may designate in writing from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the

discretion: (x) cause significant competitive harm to the Company, the Related
Entities and their respective businesses if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not consummated; (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or
other privilege; or (z) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or
binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (it being

consequences). Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the
Company, which may be withheld for any reason, Parent shall not contact any
suppliers to, or customers of, the Company or the Related Entities and Parent

51  investigations of the Company Real Property. Parent shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to any access or information provided pursuant to this Section

Section 6.03 Disclosure Schedules.

 

(a) Information furnished in any particular section of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to be included in another section of the Disclosure
Schedules to the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as
to make its relevance to the information called for by such other section
reasonably apparent on its face. The subsections and subheadings used in any
section of the Disclosure Schedules are for reference purposes only and shall
not in any manner limit the construction of the Disclosure Schedules, and any
disclosure made in any subsection or subheading shall be deemed made for all
provisions of the corresponding section of this Agreement. Any information
provided in the Disclosure Schedules is solely for information purposes, and
the inclusion of such information shall not be deemed to enlarge, enhance or
diminish in any way any of the covenants, agreements, representations or
warranties under this Agreement or otherwise alter in any way the terms of
this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in any section of the
Disclosure Schedules or other document delivered by the parties pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever.

 

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right
(but not the obligation, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11) to
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto (each a "Schedule
Supplement"), and each such Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be
incorporated into and to supplement and amend the Disclosure Schedules as of
the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that in the event such event,
development or occurrence which is the subject of the Schedule Supplement
constitutes or relates to something that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, then Parent shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement for failure to satisfy the closing condition set
forth in Section 7.02(a); _provided, further,_ that if Parent has the right
to, but does not elect to terminate this Agreement within 10 Business Days of
its receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then Parent shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such
matter under any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02; provided that
any such waiver shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
Parent hereunder.

Section 6.04 Confidentiality. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Parent pursuant to

Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this Section
6.04 shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party
shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly
seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The
parties hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals.

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices
to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in
Section 4.03 of the Disclosure Schedules. Parent shall reasonably cooperate

that all of the Guarantees are released and terminated prior to the Closing

Guarantees which are not released and terminated prior to Closing, Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assume the Guarantees and
shall provide the Guarantors under such Guarantees with an indemnity for any
and all Losses that arise under such Guarantees by actions of Parent or the
Surviving Company after the Closing Date, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Backstop Indemnity Agreement"). For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.05(c) shall not apply to the Existing Tax
Credit Guaranty Agreements covered by Section 6.20.

deliver to Parent a completed and executed assignment with respect to
Redwoods 1% ownership interest in Wexford Finance in accordance with Section

this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise
communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and in
all cases the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any
such announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of General Partner,
Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to
specific questions presented by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as such statements are substantially similar to previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by General Partner, Parent or
the Company in accordance with this Section 6.07.

 



53 Section 6.08 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the
parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute
and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.09 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including
any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and
paid equally by Parent and Wexford Equities when due. Parent shall timely file
(or cause to be filed) any Tax Return or other document with respect to such
Taxes or fees (and Wexford Equities shall cooperate with respect thereto
as necessary).

Section 6.10 Tax Matters.

(a) For United States Federal and, to the greatest extent permissible, state
and local income Tax purposes, the parties hereto agree and shall treat the
Merger, solely for Federal and state income Tax purposes, as a transaction
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4) and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(5) _Example 5_. Accordingly, (i) Wexford
Equities, each Non-Accredited Class B Holder and each other holder of Company
LLC Interests receiving cash or General Partner Common Stock will be treated
as selling his, her or its Company LLC Interests in the Company to Parent for
cash and/or General Partner Common Stock, as applicable, immediately
before the Closing; and (ii) as of the Closing, the Company will be treated
as (A) contributing all the assets and liabilities of the Company attributable
to the interests of Accredited Class B Holders to Parent in exchange for OP
Units pursuant to Section 721 of the Code and (B) immediately thereafter,
distributing the OP Units to the Accredited Class B Holders and its remaining
assets to Parent in liquidation of the Company. In accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4), Wexford Equities hereby expressly consents
to treat the Merger, solely for Federal and state income tax purposes, as a
sale of its Company LLC Interests for cash, and each Non-Accredited Class B
Holder and every other recipient of cash or General Partner Common Stock will
provide a similar consent pursuant to a separate written instrument. In
addition, Wexford Equities, the Company and Parent further agree that (i) the
Merger shall result in a termination of the Company for purposes of Section
708 of the Code, (ii) the transactions contemplated hereby will result in a
termination of each of the Related Entities, and (iii) the taxable year of the
Company and each Related Entity shall close as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date. All income, gains, losses and deductions of the Company shall be
allocated to Wexford Equities and the other holders of the Company LLC
Interests immediately prior to the Merger (for the avoidance of doubt, not
including Parent) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, based on the closing of the
Companys books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date. Similarly, all
income, gains, losses and deductions of the Related Entities shall
be allocated to those persons holding interest in such Related Entities
immediately prior to the Merger (for the avoidance of doubt, not including
Parent) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, based on the closing of the books of
each Related Entity as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.

 



54 (b) The Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and
any of the Related Entities required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice. The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, each such Tax
Return to Parent no later than 30 days prior to the due date of such Tax
Return (including applicable extension periods) and shall make any changes
reasonably requested by Parent prior to filing such Tax Return. The Company
shall pay any Taxes required to be paid pursuant to such Tax Returns.

(c) Wexford Equities, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all income Tax Returns that
relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (and are required to be filed after the
Closing Date) for the Company and the Related Entities that are pass-through
entities. Wexford Equities is hereby authorized and directed to sign (or cause
to be signed) all such income Tax Returns as an authorized person of the
Company and the Related Entities. Wexford Equities shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, each such Tax Return to Parent no later than 30 days prior to
the due date of such Tax Return (including applicable extension periods) and
shall make any changes reasonably requested by Parent prior to filing such
Tax Returns. Wexford Equities shall pay any Taxes required to be paid by the
Company or the Related Entities in connection with such Tax Returns.

(d) Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all other Tax Returns for the
Company and the Related Entities required to be filed after the Closing Date,
including any non-income Tax Returns attributable to the Straddle Period.
Parent shall deliver to Wexford Equities, for its review and comment, each Tax
Return relating to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date at
least 30 days prior to the filing of each such Tax Return, and shall consider
in good faith such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested
by Wexford Equities. Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company and the
Related Entities to the extent permitted by Law. Within five days prior to the
filing of such Tax Returns, Wexford Equities shall pay to Parent the amount of
any Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including that portion of
the Straddle Period that is deemed to end at the end of the day on the Closing
Date.

(e) After the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Company shall, promptly
upon receipt of notice thereof, provide prompt notice to Wexford Equities of
the commencement or scheduling of any Tax audits affecting the Surviving
Company and the Related Entities for periods prior to the Closing Date. Parent
and Wexford Equities shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes, and in connection with any matters
that may impact the status of an Affiliate of Parent as a real estate
investment trust under Section 856 of the Code. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Parent and Wexford Equities agree (A) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Surviving 

 



55  Company and the Related Entities relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Surviving Company, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority, and
(B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Parent or Wexford Equities, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records. Wexford
Equities acknowledges that Parent is a real estate investment trust as such
term is defined in Section 856 of the Code. In order to enable Parent to
determine compliance with the REIT qualification requirements upon completion
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Wexford Equities shall provide to
Parent any information relating to the composition of the assets and income of
the Company and the Related Entities as may be reasonably requested by Parent
for such purpose.

 

Section 6.11 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent of (a) any notice or other communication from any
third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
if such third-party consent is not described in Section 4.03 of the
Disclosure Schedules, (b) any notice or other communication from any third
party whose consent is required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that such third party refuses to give such
consent, (c) any Material Adverse Effect, (d) any Event of Loss or Taking, or
(e) the occurrence or existence of any event that results, or with notice or
the passage of time or otherwise, is reasonably likely to result, in
the failure of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that the delivery of notice pursuant to this Section
6.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to Parent.

Section 6.12 No Solicitation.

(a) Wexford Equities and the Company agree they shall not, and shall cause
each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

 

(i) solicit, initiate or induce or knowingly or intentionally facilitate or
encourage any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) furnish to any Person any information with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal;

(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person as to
the existence of these provisions;

 

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or

(v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract,
commitment or understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated thereby. 

 



56  Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Affiliate or
Representative of Wexford Equities or the Company, whether or not such Person
is purporting to act on behalf of Wexford Equities or the Company or
otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 6.12(a).

(b) Wexford Equities and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately terminate all
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party with respect to, or
any discussions that would reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplate
the possibility of, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but
in no event later than five Business Days following the execution of
this Agreement) demand that each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with Wexford Equities or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives with respect to such Persons
consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal (other than agreements that
have expired by their terms) to immediately return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by such Person to the Company) all
confidential information heretofore furnished by Wexford Equities, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives to such
Person.

(c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 48 hours, after the
Company receives or has Knowledge of any Acquisition Proposal or any request
for information or inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall advise Parent in writing as to the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and provide a copy of all written materials
provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.
After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company
shall continue to promptly keep Parent informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including notice of all material amendments or
proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry and shall as promptly as practicable provide to Parent a copy of all
written materials subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition

Section 6.16 Risk of Loss.

(a) If, prior to Closing, any fire or other casualty occurs with respect any

written notice thereof within 10 days after Wexford Equities obtains
knowledge of such event. Within 30 days of such event, Wexford Equities shall
to deliver to Parent, from an architect or general contractor, who has
previously worked with Wexford Equities in constructing any Improvements,
acting in good faith and in the exercise of their professional judgment (each,
a "Restoration Professional"), an estimate as to the costs and duration of any
required repairs or restoration (the "Estimated Restoration Costs"). If the
Estimated Restoration Costs exceeds $60,000,000 (a "Material

 



58  Loss") then Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by
written notice to Wexford Equities within 15 days after the date Parent
receives the Estimated Restoration Costs from Wexford Equities, whereupon
this Agreement shall be deemed terminated as of the date of notice. If Parent
fails to send such notice to Wexford Equities within such 15 day time period,
then the parties shall proceed to Closing in accordance with clause (ii)
below. In the event a Material Loss occurs and Parent does not elect to
terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.16(a), or in the event
of any Event of Loss does not constitute a Material Loss, Wexford Equities
shall either (at Wexford Equities sole option) (i) repair and restore such
loss or damage prior to Closing, in which event Closing shall be extended for
such time as is reasonable under the circumstances to allow Wexford
Equities to complete such restoration, or (ii) proceed to Closing with Parent
with the affected Company Real Property in its damaged condition (or in its
condition existing at the Closing Date if repairs or restoration shall have
been commenced but remain unfinished), and assign or turn-over to Parent all
proceeds of insurance or recoveries from third parties actually received by
Wexford Equities as of the Closing Date (including all proceeds received from
rent-loss insurance for the period on and after the Closing Date, which rent
loss proceeds shall be subject to apportionment as rent under this Agreement),
together with all of Wexford Equities right, title and interest in and to (A)
any unpaid claim Wexford Equities has under the insurance policies covering
the affected Company Real Property (including without limitation any unpaid
claim arising under any policies of rent-loss insurance applicable to the
period on and after the Closing Date), and (B) any unpaid claim Wexford
Equities has against any other third party as a result of the loss or damage,
all less such reasonable amounts as Wexford Equities shall have paid or
incurred for the repair, preservation or restoration of such loss or
damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any Event of Loss is
uninsured, then Parent may terminate this Agreement within 10 days after the
determination, evidenced in writing by the property insurer, that the Event of
Loss is uninsured;  _provided, however_ , that Wexford Equities may nullify
Parents election to terminate this Agreement by sending written notice
thereof to Parent within 30 days after Wexford Equities receipt of Parents
termination notice, along with a notice of Estimated Restoration Costs, in
which event the parties shall proceed to Closing in accordance with clause
(ii) above and Parent shall receive a credit against the Base Purchase Price
at Closing in the amount of the Estimated Restoration Costs.

(b) In the event of the occurrence an Event of Loss to any Company Real
Property, Wexford Equities shall cause such temporary repairs to be made to
the Company Real Property as shall be required to prevent further
deterioration and damage to the Company Real Property prior to the Closing;
_provided, however_ , that Wexford Equities shall be reimbursed from the
proceeds of any insurance with respect to the affected Company Real Property
for the reasonable costs of all such repairs. Such repairs shall be performed
in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all Law and Orders of
all Governmental Authorities.

(c) In the case of any Material Loss and provided that this Agreement shall be
in full force and effect, Wexford Equities shall not settle or compromise any
insurance claims without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



59 (d) The parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any Event of Loss (other than claims arising from fraud or
willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be pursuant to this
Section 6.16.

 

Section 6.17 Condemnation.

(a) If, prior to Closing, any part of the Company Real Property is condemned
by a Governmental Authority asserting the right of eminent domain, or Wexford
Equities receives notice of any proposed or actual condemnation, taking by
eminent domain, or similar proceeding with respect to any Company Real
Property (each, a "Taking"), Wexford Equities shall promptly notify Parent in
writing, and, if such taking shall constitute a Material Taking, Parent shall
have the option, by sending written notice to Wexford Equities within 15 days
after Parent receives written notice from Wexford Equities concerning such
condemnation, (i) to terminate this Agreement, whereupon this Agreement shall
be deemed terminated as of the date of notice, or (ii) to proceed to Closing
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If Parent fails to send such
termination notice to Wexford Equities within such 15 day time period, then
the parties shall proceed to Closing in accordance with Section 6.17(b) below.

(b) If Parent does not elect (or does not have the right to elect) to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.17(a) above, then Wexford
Equities shall not consent to a negotiated or compromise settlement of any
condemnation, eminent domain or other similar proceeding without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Parent does not elect to terminate this Agreement
as aforesaid, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to all
other Company Real Property not taken or proposed to be taken by condemnation
or eminent domain or other similar proceedings, and Wexford Equities shall
assign or turn-over to Parent all condemnation or eminent domain awards or
proceeds actually received by Wexford Equities as of the Closing Date
(excluding such award or proceeds to reimburse Wexford Equities for all
reasonable amounts Wexford Equities shall have paid or incurred for the
repair, preservation or restoration of such Company Real Property on account
of such Taking) or, in the event such proceeds have not been paid to Wexford
Equities as of the date of Closing, Wexford Equities shall irrevocably assign
to Parent, at Closing, Wexford Equities right to receive such proceeds, and
excepting any award or proceeds to reimburse Wexford Equities for all
reasonable amounts Wexford Equities shall have paid or incurred for the
repair, preservation or restoration of such Company Real Property on account
of such Taking (which shall be settled with the Government Authority
cooperatively by Wexford Equities and Parent, acting reasonably and in good
faith), Parent, after Closing, shall have the sole right to settle any claim
in connection with such Taking.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any Taking shall be pursuant to this Section 6.17.

Section 6.18 Employment Matters.

 

(a) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall have the right to extend offers of
employment to the individuals listed on Schedule III (the "Business
Employees"), either directly or through

 



60  its Affiliates. Effective immediately prior to the Closing, Wexford Equities
shall terminate the Employee Leasing Agreement with respect to the Business
Employees and shall cause Parkway Support Services to terminate the
employment of each of the Business Employees, and shall take such other
actions as are necessary or reasonably requested by Parent to enable the
Business Employees to accept employment with Parent or its Affiliates.
Wexford Equities and the Company shall provide evidence of such terminations
to Parent prior to the Closing in such forms as may be reasonably requested by
Parent.

(b) To the extent not already included in the calculation of the Merger
Consideration, Wexford Equities shall be responsible for all liabilities,
obligations and commitments relating to compensation and benefits relating to
the Business Employees earned or otherwise arising prior to the Closing or as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Exhibits
hereto, including any severance compensation, vacation pay and
bonus, incentive or commission payments.

(c) Wexford Equities shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide
promptly to Parent, at Parents request, any information or copies of
personnel records (including addresses, dates of birth, dates of hire and
dependent information) relating to the Business Employees or relating to the
service of Business Employees with Wexford Equities or its Affiliates (and
their predecessors, as applicable) prior to the Closing Date, except to the
extent prohibited by Law. Wexford Equities, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and shall provide to the other such documentation,
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions
of this Section 6.18. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit Parents or its
Affiliates ability to terminate the employment of any Business Employee at
any time and for any reason, including without cause.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) nothing
in this Agreement shall prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates from changing its compensation structure or employee benefit
programs or obligates Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates to provide any particular type or amount of compensation or
benefits to any Business Employee; (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed (A) as resulting in any Business Employee being employed other than
on an "at will" basis, or (B) as obligating Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their Affiliates to employ any Business Employee for any length of time
following the Closing; and (iii) no Business Employee, and no beneficiary of
any Business Employee, shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement.

(a) At least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent copies of the Companys audited
financial statements consisting of the balance sheet of the Company and its

with

 



61  GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the period involved, together
with (i) an Independent Auditors Report of CohnReznick, LLP in the same form

year-end and the related statements of operations, equity and cash flows for
the interim period then ended (the "2013 Interim Financial
Statements"), prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the period involved, subject to normal recurring adjustments and
the absence of notes. The 2013 Interim Financial Statements shall include all
estimated accruals related to expenses, liabilities, allowance for doubtful
accounts, tenant lease revenues, and Tenant Charges pass-through
reconciliations as of and through the Closing Date.

Section 6.20 Tax Credits.

(a) The parties acknowledge that certain of the Company Real Property
projects have benefited from Federal rehabilitation tax credits ("HTC")
arising under Section 47 of the Code and/or Federal new markets tax credits
("NMTC") arising under Section 45D of the Code (the "Tax Credit Properties"),
and that Wexford Equities, the Company and certain of their Affiliates (the
"Existing Guarantors") have entered into certain guaranty and
indemnification agreements (the "Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements")
for the benefit of certain lenders and tax credit investors and their
Affiliates (the "Tax Credit Beneficiaries") in connection with the financial
closings for such Tax Credit Properties. The Tax Credit Properties, the
Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements, the Existing Guarantors and the Tax
Credit Beneficiaries are set forth on Schedule IV, and Wexford Equities and
the Company hereby represent and warrant that Schedule IV contains a true and
correct list of all of the Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements entered
into by the Existing Guarantors.

(b) To the extent provided herein, Parent shall assume the obligations of the
Existing Guarantors under the Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements under
assumption and release documents to be negotiated by and among the Existing
Guarantors, Parent and the Tax Credit Beneficiaries prior to Closing (the "Tax
Credit Guaranty Assumption Documents"), or if the Existing Tax Credit
Beneficiaries for any reason fail to execute Tax Credit Guaranty Assumption
Documents acceptable to Parent and Existing Guarantors, Parent will provide
Existing Guarantors with an indemnity for any and all Losses that arise under
such Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements for which Parent is responsible
under this Section 6.20(b) in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B. Pursuant to the Tax Credit Guaranty Assumption Documents (or such
indemnity), as between Parent and the Existing Guarantors, (i) Wexford
Equities shall remain responsible for all Losses arising under the Existing
Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements arising out of or resulting from or in any way
relating to (A) any conduct or action 

 



62  occurring on or before the Closing Date, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and any set of facts existing on or before the Closing Date or
which otherwise first accrues prior to the Closing Date, (B) liability under
the Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements for the specific matters
identified on Part A of Schedule V, but only to the extent relating to the
period before the Closing Date or accruing on or before the Closing Date, and
(C) liability under the Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements for the
specific matters identified on Part B of Schedule V, whether relating to the
period before the Closing Date or accruing before, on or after the Closing
Date (unless such liability arises from modifications to the transaction
documents after the Closing Date or the failure of Parent, the Surviving
Company, their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to perform their obligations
under the transaction documents after the Closing Date) ((A), (B), and (C),
collectively the "Wexford Tax Credit Responsibilities"); and (ii) Parent shall
be responsible for all other Losses arising under the Existing Tax
Credit Guaranty Agreements and, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all
Losses for any HTC financing or NMTC financing transactions that close after
the Closing Date (the "Parent Tax Credit Responsibilities"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Wake Forest Building 90 shall be treated as a Tax Credit
Property without regard to whether the closing of the Wake Forest Building 90
tax credit financing occurs before or after the Closing Date, and the tax
credit guaranty agreements expected to be entered into in connection with the
closing of the Wake Forest Building 90 tax credit financing shall be treated
for purposes of this Section 6.20 as Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements,
except that with respect to the Wexford Tax Credit Responsibilities for Wake
Forest Building 90, Wexford Equities shall be responsible for Losses arising
out of or resulting from or in any way relating to liability under such
Existing Tax Credit Guaranty Agreements relating to Wake Forest Building 90
only to the extent that a Tax Credit Beneficiary recognizes taxable income
from the syndication of North Carolina Mill Rehabilitation tax credits.

Section 6.21 Commencement of Construction; Payment of Construction Amount.
Upon the Commencement of Construction of University of Maryland Building 3,
Parent shall promptly pay to Wexford Equities $8,481,000, and upon the
Commencement of Construction of Wake Forest Building 60, Parent shall promptly
pay to Wexford Equities $1,069,674; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall
not be obligated to make any payment pursuant to this Section 6.21 with
respect to a particular project if (a) the Commencement of Construction of
such project occurs prior to the Closing Date without Parents prior written
consent, or (b) the Commencement of Construction of such project does not
occur prior to the date that is seven years after the Closing Date (or, with
respect to Wake Forest Building 60, such earlier date on which the NPS Part 3
approval is obtained for Wake Forest Building 91 and Wake Forest Building
90). If, at any time prior to the date that is seven years after the Closing
Date, General Partner fails to maintain at least one of the following: (x) a
credit rating of at least BBB- by Standard and Poors, (y) a credit rating of
at least Baa3 by Moodys, or (z) the equivalent level by any other nationally
recognized credit rating agency or the equivalent private rating by any such
credit rating agency, then, upon written request from Wexford Equities,
Parent shall deposit the Construction Amount (less any amounts previously paid
to Wexford Equities pursuant to this Section 6.21) with the Escrow Agent, to
be held in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement substantially similar to
the Escrow Agreement with such changes necessary to conform such

 



63  escrow agreement to the terms of this Section 6.21 as are mutually
acceptable to Parent and Wexford Equities, until the date that is seven years
after the Closing Date, at which time any remaining amounts held in escrow
shall be returned to Parent. If Parent fails to pay when due any amounts owing
pursuant to this Section 6.21, Parent shall pay to Wexford Equities interest
on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue
amount is actually paid to Wexford Equities in full) at a rate per annum equal
to 5% over the "prime rate" (as published in The Wall Street Journal) in
effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

 

Section 6.22 Registration Statement; Listing.

(a) In the event General Partner elects to make the Wexford Stock Issuance at
the Closing, General Partner shall promptly after the Closing (i) prepare and
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act a registration statement (the "Registration Statement")
covering resales of the General Partner Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Wexford Stock Issuance (the "Registrable Securities") and shall cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 60 days
after the Closing Date; and (ii) take any action required to be taken under
foreign or state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the Wexford
Stock Issuance, except that General Partner shall not for any such purpose be
required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign company or to
register as a broker or dealer in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 6.22(a), or to consent
to general service of process in any such jurisdiction, or to be subject to
any Tax obligation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.
General Partner shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to remain effective until the Registrable Securities:
(i) have been disposed of in accordance with the Registration Statement; (ii)
have been sold in accordance with Rule 144 (or any similar rule or regulation
then in effect) under the Securities Act; (iii) become eligible to be publicly
sold without limitation as to amount or manner of sale pursuant to Rule
144 (or any similar rule or regulation then in effect) under the Securities
Act; or (iv) cease to be outstanding.

(b) In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, Wexford
Equities shall promptly after the Closing (within three Business Days after
request by General Partner) furnish in writing to General Partner such
information regarding Wexford Equities and its Affiliates, the Registrable
Securities to be sold, the intended method of distribution and such other
information requested by General Partner as is necessary or advisable for
inclusion in the Registration Statement. Such writing shall expressly state
that it is being furnished to General Partner for use in the preparation of
the Registration Statement.

 

(c) General Partner shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registrable Securities, if any, to be approved for listing on the NYSE.

(d) Wexford Equities may, at its option, sell the Registrable Securities
through an underwritten offering. In such event, Wexford Equities shall be
entitled to select the managing underwriter(s). In connection with an
underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 6.22, General Partner shall (i)
enter into an underwriting agreement which contains, to the extent

 



64  possible, such representations, covenants, indemnities and other rights and
obligations as are customary in underwriting agreements for firm commitment
offerings of securities, and (ii) prepare, in coordination with Wexford
Equities and the underwriter(s) in the offering, and timely file with the SEC
such preliminary and final prospectuses or prospectus supplements as are
legally required or reasonably requested by Wexford Equities for the
offering.

(e) In connection with an underwritten offering pursuant to this Section
6.22, General Partner will furnish upon request, and at Wexford Equities
sole cost and expense, (i) an opinion of counsel to General Partner addressed
to Wexford Equities and the underwriter(s), dated the effective date of the
Registration Statement or the date of any amendment or supplement thereto,
and a letter of like kind dated the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement, and (ii) a "comfort" letter, dated the effective date of the
Registration Statement or the date of any amendment or supplement thereto and
a letter of like kind dated the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement, in each case, signed by the independent public accountants who have
certified to General Partners and Parents financial statements included or
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, and each of the
opinion and the "comfort" letter shall be in customary form and covering
substantially the same matters with respect to such Registration Statement
(and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein) as are
customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants
letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten offerings of
securities.

(f) In connection with an underwritten public offering pursuant to
this Section 6.22, General Partner will make available to the appropriate
representatives of the managing underwriter and Wexford Equities and their
respective counsels, at Wexford Equities sole cost and expense, access to such
information and General Partners and Parents personnel as is reasonable and
customary to enable such parties to establish a due diligence defense under
the Securities Act.

(g) In connection with a public offering which is underwritten pursuant to
Section 6.22(d), Wexford Equities shall pay, promptly upon receipt of invoice,
all fees and expenses associated with such underwritten public offering that
would not have been incurred by General Partner or Parent, but for the public
offering being done on an underwritten basis, including, without limitation,
all fees and expenses arising from the obligations referenced in Section
6.22(d), Section 6.22(e) and Section 6.22(f). All other fees and expenses of
General Partner and Parent with respect to this Section 6.22 shall be paid by
General Partner. In all cases, Wexford Equities shall pay all fees and
expenses incurred by Wexford Equities and its Affiliates, including, without
limitation, all fees and expenses of their counsel, accountants and other
Representatives, as well as transfer taxes, underwriting or brokerage
commissions or discounts and other selling expenses.

Section 6.23 Non-Operating Assets. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall transfer, distribute or otherwise assign the Non-Operating Assets to
Wexford Equities or its Affiliates in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
Parent (the "Non-Operating Assets Distribution"). In connection with the Non-

and obligations relating to the Non-Operating Assets and agree to hold General
Partner, Parent and their Affiliates harmless from same.

efforts to acquire and hold, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
the record and beneficial title in all of the limited liability company
interests of each of the entities listed in Section 6.24(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules, free and clear of all Encumbrances. If the Company does not
acquire and hold the record and beneficial title in any of the limited
liability company interests of each of the entities in Section 6.24(a) in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent, Wexford Equities shall
promptly reimburse Parent for its costs in connection with the acquisition of
such limited liability interests; _provided_ that Wexford Equities shall have
the right to consent to such acquisition, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into an agreement, note or similar debt instrument to
document, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the liabilities
listed in Section 6.24(b) of the Disclosure Schedules. If the Company does not
document such liabilities in Section 6.24(b) of the Disclosure Schedules in a
manner consistent with the requirements of the applicable LLC operating
agreement that is valid, binding and enforceable, Wexford Equities shall
promptly reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs incurred in connection
with the documentation of such liabilities and any other Losses that result
from the unenforceability of such liabilities.

to be performed by the landlord shall materially conform to the information

modifications by the respective ground lessor or tenant, as applicable,
necessary to conform such form estoppel certificate to the requirements of the
subject Ground Lease or Lease (which requirements, for example, may allow the

as an exhibit to such Ground Lease or Lease, or in accordance with the
provisions contained in the body of such Ground Lease or Lease).

(to the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice from the non-

any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, them based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or document
executed and delivered to General Partner, Parent by the Company or Wexford

contained in any representation or warranty relating to materiality or

Forest Building 90 and Wake Forest Building 91 to the extent the syndication

Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the close of business on the Closing
Date. The portion of any Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that is
deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (x) in the case of Property Taxes,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (y)
in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the
Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date;

 

(d)(i) any employment, payroll, withholding or similar Taxes imposed on the

Class B Holders prior to the Closing or (B) the exchange of Class B Interests
for Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) the

pursuant to that certain Project Development Oversight Agreement effective

Section 8.03 Indemnification By Parent. From and after the Closing and subject
to the other terms and conditions of this Article VIII, Parent shall
indemnify Wexford Equities and its Affiliates against, and shall hold it
harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, it based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
General Partner, Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any
certificate or document executed and delivered to Wexford Equities by General
Partner, Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto;

 



71 (b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to

Agreement, or any certificate or document executed and delivered to Wexford
Equities by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto; or

 

(c) the Parent Tax Credit Responsibilities in accordance with Section 6.20(b).

 

Section 8.04 Certain Limitations. The parties making a claim under this
Article VIII are referred to collectively as the "Indemnified Party," and the
party against whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is
referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." The indemnification provided for in
Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 8.02(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under Section 8.02(a) exceeds $1,500,000 (the
"Deductible Amount"), in which event the Indemnifying Party shall only be
required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount.
The aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable pursuant to Section 8.02(a) and (b) shall not exceed $60,000,000 (the
"Cap Amount"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
qualification or exception contained in any representation or warranty
relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 8.03(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under Section 8.03(a) exceeds the Deductible
Amount, in which event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay
or be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount. The aggregate
amount of all Losses for which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant
to Section 8.03(a) and (b) shall not exceed the Cap Amount.

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section
8.03 in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the
Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) in respect of any such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (at the
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense) to recover under insurance
policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar Contracts which would
reasonably be expected to cover such Losses (provided that the Indemnified
Party shall not be required to litigate any dispute, or otherwise bring any
claim, lawsuit or other proceeding to obtain such insurance and other
proceeds). If such insurance proceeds are received by the Indemnified Party
(or its Affiliates) after the date on which the Indemnifying Party pays such
indemnification claim to the Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates),
the Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) shall, no later than five Business
Days after receipt of such insurance proceeds, (i) if the payment with respect
to such indemnification claim was paid out of the Escrow Amount and the Escrow
Agreement remains in effect, replenish the Escrow Amount with the amount
received, net of any costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party (or
its Affiliates) related thereto, or (ii) if otherwise, remit such proceeds,
net of any costs 

 



72  and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) related
thereto, to the Indemnifying Party (and if Wexford Equities is the
Indemnifying Party, Wexford Equities shall disburse such net proceeds in
accordance with Section 2.06(b)).

(d) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section
8.03 in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax
benefit actually realized as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party in
the year in which such Loss was incurred. Whether the Indemnified Party
actually realizes a Tax benefit shall be determined based on the actual
reduction in the taxable income of such Indemnified Party solely as a result
of the incurrence of such Loss in the year in which such Loss was incurred,
determined in good faith by the Indemnified Partys accountants by calculating
the taxable income of the Indemnified Party with and without such Loss.

(e) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, unless such damages are suffered by a third party and form part of
a claim by such third party made against an Indemnified Party.

 

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss (at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost
and expense) upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be
reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

(g) Wexford Equities and the other holders of Company LLC Interests shall not
have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert) any
right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against
the Surviving Company in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which such parties may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 

(h) Wexford Equities and the other holders of Related Entity LLC Interests and
Agent Common Stock shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert) any right of contribution, right of indemnity
or other right or remedy against the Related Entities in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such parties
may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Deductible Amount nor the Cap Amount shall apply to any claims relating to or
arising out of (i) the Fundamental Representations, (ii) the matters
referenced in Section 8.02(c), Section 8.02(d), Section 8.02(e), Section
8.02(f) or Section 8.03(c), (iii) the purchase price adjustments referenced in
Section 3.05, or (iv) fraud or willful misconduct. 

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall

 



73  give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to
give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that
the Indemnifying Partys defense is materially prejudiced by such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or could reasonably be expected to be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 days from
receipt of notice of the Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel (which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to
Section 8.05(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
reasonably necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims
pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnified Party; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
take no action that could impact (in the sole judgment of Parent) the status
of an Affiliate of Parent as a real estate investment trust under Section 856
of the Code or could adversely impact the Tax status or Tax position of Parent
or its Affiliates. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject
to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party, _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the
fees of more than one separate counsel (and any local counsel if necessary)
for the Indemnified Party). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise
or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified
Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend
such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to
the provisions of Section 6.04) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-
defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.

(b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into a settlement of
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
as provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial
or other obligation or any admission of fault on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in

 



74  customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within 20
days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to this Section 8.05(b),
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 

(c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Partys defense is
materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or could reasonably be
expected to be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 20 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. During such 20-day period, the Indemnified Party shall
allow the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable access to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including reasonable
access to the Surviving Companys premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party
or any of its Representatives may reasonably request;  _provided, however_ ,
that any such investigation shall be conducted during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice to Parent, under the supervision of Parents
personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations
of Parent. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 20-day
period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 10.10.

Section 8.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 

Section 8.07 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 10.11, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud or willful misconduct
on the part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this

 



75  Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article VIII. Nothing in this Section 8.07 shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled pursuant to Section 10.11 or to seek any remedy on account
of fraud or willful misconduct by any party hereto.

Article IX

Section 7.02, and (ii) the Company, Wexford Equities or any of their
Affiliates enters into a Contract with respect to an Acquisition Transaction

of such termination, then the Company and Wexford Equities shall pay to Parent
an additional amount equal to $15,000,000, which amount shall be payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than two Business Days
after the earlier of (x) the entry into such Contract or (y) the consummation
of such Acquisition Transaction. 

 



77 (d) If the Company or Wexford Equities fails to pay when due any amounts
payable to Parent under Section 9.02(b) or Section 9.02(c), then (i) the
Company and Wexford Equities shall reimburse Parent for all fees and expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in connection with the
enforcement by Parent of its rights under Section 9.02(b) and Section
9.02(c), and (ii) the Company and Wexford Equities shall pay to Parent
interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such
overdue amount is actually paid to Parent in full) at a rate per annum equal
to 5% over the "prime rate" (as published in The Wall Street Journal) in
effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. If
Parent fails to pay when due any amounts payable to the Company under Section
9.02(b), then (i) Parent shall reimburse the Company for all fees and expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in connection with the
enforcement by the Company of its rights under Section 9.02(b), and (ii)
Parent shall pay to the Company interest on such overdue amount (for the

to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the
Company in full) at a rate per annum equal to 5% over the "prime rate" (as
published in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid.

(e) The Company and Wexford Equities acknowledge that the agreements of the
Company contained in Section 9.02(b) through Section 9.02(d) are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, Parent, General Partner and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Parent, General Partner and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
agreements of Parent contained in Section 9.02(b) and Section 9.02(d) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Company and Wexford Equities would not enter
into this Agreement. Payment of the amounts described in Section 9.02(b)
through Section 9.02(d) shall not be in lieu of any liability pursuant to
Section 9.02(a)(iii). For the avoidance of doubt, each payment made to Parent
or the Company pursuant to Section 9.02(b) through Section 9.02(d) shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other payments payable pursuant to such
Sections.
