-17- (v) on behalf of the Companies, to the recipients thereof and subject to
receipt of final invoices, an amount sufficient to pay the Estimated Seller
Transaction Expenses (other than as set forth in _Section 2.3(b)(iv)_ );
_provided_ that the amount of any retention bonuses (to the extent payable at
Closing), option proceeds, restricted share grant (if no election pursuant to
Section 83(b) of the Code was made in respect of such grant) proceeds or
similar compensatory amounts payable to current employees of the Companies
shall be paid on the first payroll date after the Closing Date through the
Companies payroll system; _provided_ , _further_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, any such retention or similar payments due to directors, former
employees or other service providers of the Companies that are not employees
shall be paid directly by Buyers as set forth in the "funds flow memo"
referenced below; and

 

(vi) to Sellers the Initial Purchase Price less the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 

(c) Each of the foregoing payments set forth in _Sections 2.3(b)(i)_ and
_(iv)_ will be considered payments on behalf of Sensus USA and in respect of
obligations and liabilities of the Companies or their applicable Subsidiaries.
This Agreement does not constitute an obligation of the Companies to pay in
full any obligations of the Companies for which separate pay-off amounts have
been negotiated. Each of the foregoing payments shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as are indicated by
Sellers in a "funds flow memo" to be delivered to Buyers by Sellers no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(d) The "funds flow memo" shall set forth an itemized list of all, and
amounts of all, Seller Transaction Expenses, including the identity of each
payee, dollar amounts owed (including timing of required payments), wire
instructions and any other information necessary to effect the final payment
in full thereof.

2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sensus
Worldwide shall deliver to Buyers a certificate (the " _Pre-Closing
Statement_ "), executed by Sensus Worldwide, setting forth (i) a good faith
estimate of the consolidated balance sheet of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries, as of the Determination Time, (ii) its good faith estimates
of (A) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (B) Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Working Capital_ "), (C) any unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses (the "
_Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses_ ") and (D) Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), in each case of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis as of the Determination Time
and without giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby (except in
the case of Seller Transaction Expenses), together with reasonable supporting
materials used in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Statement, and (iii) on
the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Initial Purchase Price. The
Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith on a basis consistent
with the Accounting Principles. Sellers shall provide Buyers an opportunity to
review and discuss the Pre-Closing Statement and reasonable backup materials
and shall consider any reasonable objection in good faith.

(b) Subsequent to the Closing and subject to _Section 2.4(g)_ , the Initial
Purchase Price shall be:

 

(i) _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which Estimated Cash exceeds the
Final Cash, or _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which Final Cash exceeds
Estimated Cash;

 



-18- (ii) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which Final Working
Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital or _decreased_ by the amount (if
any) by which Estimated Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital;

 

(iii) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which Estimated Seller Transaction
Expenses exceeds the Final Seller Transaction Expenses, or _decreased_ by the
amount (if any) by which Final Seller Transaction Expenses exceeds Estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses; and

 

(iv) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which Estimated Indebtedness
exceeds the Final Indebtedness, or  _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by
which Final Indebtedness exceeds Estimated Indebtedness.

The Initial Purchase Price, as so increased or decreased in accordance with
this _Section 2.4(b)_ , shall be the " _Final Purchase Price_ " hereunder.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than ninety (90)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyers shall (i) prepare a statement of
the calculation of Cash, Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses and Working
Capital, in each case as of the Determination Time, together with a
calculation of the Final Purchase Price (the " _Closing Date Statement_ "),
and (ii) deliver the Closing Date Statement to Sensus Worldwide. The Closing
Date Statement shall be prepared in good faith on a basis consistent with the
Accounting Principles and the terms of this Agreement.

(d) In connection with the preparation and review of the Pre-Closing
Statement and the Closing Date Statement, Buyers and Sellers shall, and shall
cause the Companies (in the case of Sellers, prior to the Closing and, in the
case of Buyers, during the period from and after the date of delivery of the
Closing Date Statement through the resolution of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this _Section 2.4_ ) to, provide the other
Party and its representatives with reasonable access during normal business
hours to the books and records, personnel, facilities and representatives of
the Companies. Furthermore, each Party shall have the right to review the work
papers of the other Party in connection with preparing and reviewing the Pre-
Closing Statement, the Closing Date Statement and the calculation of the
Final Purchase Price; _provided_ , that the independent accountants of the
Parties, if any, shall not be obligated to make any such work papers available
unless and until the non-client Party has signed a customary confidentiality
and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to such work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 

(e) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Sensus Worldwide shall inform Buyers in writing either (i) that
the Closing Date Statement is acceptable or (ii) of any good faith objection
to the Closing Date Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such objection and the specific adjustment to amounts, determinations
and calculations set forth on the Closing Date Statement that Sellers believe

 



-19-  should be made (an " _Objection Notice_ "). Any Objection Notice may
reference disagreements in the calculations of Cash, Indebtedness, Seller
Transaction Expenses and Working Capital as reflected on the Closing Date
Statement not being calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Any amount, determination or calculation (or any component thereof) contained
in the Closing Date Statement and not specifically disputed in a timely
delivered Objection Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. If Sensus Worldwide does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with
respect to the Closing Date Statement within such forty-five (45) calendar
day period, the Closing Date Statement will be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered within such forty-
five (45) calendar day period, Buyers and Sellers shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve each dispute raised therein (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and
any resolution by them as to any such Disputed Item shall be final, conclusive
and binding. If Buyers and Sellers, notwithstanding such good faith efforts,
fail to resolve any Disputed Item within thirty (30) calendar days after
Sensus Worldwide timely delivers an Objection Notice or such longer period as
the Parties mutually agree in writing, then Buyers and Sellers shall jointly
engage KPMG LLP or another mutually agreeable independent firm capable of
serving as an accounting expert with relevant experience in resolving such
disputes, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of Buyers or Sellers
(the " _Referral Firm_ "), to resolve only any remaining Disputed Items as
soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event, within thirty (30) calendar
days after engagement of the Referral Firm). All Disputed Items that are
resolved between the Parties or are determined by the Referral Firm will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. Upon the
agreement of the Parties with respect to all Disputed Items, the decision of
the Referral Firm with respect to all Disputed Items or Sellers failure to
deliver an Objection Notice to Buyers within the 30-day period referred to
above, the Closing Date Statement, as it may be adjusted (the " _Final Closing
Date Statement_ "), shall be final, conclusive and binding against the
Parties hereto. The statements of Cash, Working Capital, Seller Transaction
Expenses and Indebtedness set forth in the Final Closing Date Statement shall
be the " _Final Cash_ ", " _Final Working Capital_ ", " _Final Seller
Transaction Expenses_ " and " _Final Indebtedness_ ", respectively, for all
purposes hereunder.

 

(f) In resolving any Disputed Item, the Referral Firm (i) shall be bound by
the provisions of this _Section 2.4_ , (ii) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyers or Sellers, (iii) shall
limit its decision to each Disputed Item and (iv) shall make its
determination based solely on presentations by Buyers and Sellers which are
in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(i.e. not on the basis of independent review). For purposes of complying with
this _Section 2.4_ , Buyers and Sellers shall furnish to each other and to
the Referral Firm such work papers and other documents and information
relating to the Disputed Items as the Referral Firm may require and that are
available to the Party (or its independent public accountants) from whom such
documents or information are requested. The fees and expenses of the Referral
Firm shall be allocated between Buyers and Sellers in such a way that (A)
Buyers shall be responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value
of the Disputed Items submitted to the Referral Firm that are resolved against
Buyers (as finally determined by the Referral Firm) and the denominator of
which is the total dollar value of the Disputed Items so submitted and (B)
Sellers shall be responsible for the remaining amount of fees and expenses,
which such amount shall first be paid out of the Adjustment Escrow Account. In
the event of any dispute regarding such allocation, the Referral Firm shall
determine the

 



-20-  allocation of its fees and expenses as between Buyers and Sellers in
accordance with such allocation methodology, such determination to be final
and binding on each Buyer and each Seller. Except as otherwise set forth in
this _Section 2.4(f)_ , the fees and expenses of Sellers and their
representatives incurred in connection with the Closing Date Statement and any
Disputed Items shall be borne by Sellers, and the fees and expenses of Buyers
and their representatives incurred in connection with the Closing Date
Statement and any Disputed Items shall be borne by Buyers.

 

(g) Promptly after their receipt of the Final Closing Date Statement, Sellers
and Buyers shall compute the difference, if any, between the Initial Purchase
Price and the Final Purchase Price. If the Initial Purchase Price exceeds the
Final Purchase Price, then Buyers and Sellers shall deliver written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver such amount, to Buyers within
three (3) Business Days. BUYERS AGREE THAT THEIR SOLE SOURCE OF RECOVERY
UNDER THIS SECTION 2.4(g) SHALL BE LIMITED TO, AND SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE
AGGREGATE, THE ADJUSTMENT ESCROW AMOUNT. If the Initial Purchase Price is less
than the Final Purchase Price, Sellers shall be entitled to receive, promptly
and in any event within three (3) Business Days from the date of such final
determination, from Buyers an amount in cash equal to such deficiency.
Concurrently with payment of the amounts described in the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyers and Sellers shall promptly deliver written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Account (including any interest and other amounts accrued) established
under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, if any, to Sellers in accordance with
the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement. Buyers hereby covenant and agree
that they and the Companies shall have sufficient immediately available funds
after the Closing to make any payments to Sellers pursuant to this _Section
2.4_.

2.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Sellers and Buyers agree that the fair
market values of Sensus USA and the other Companies are as set forth on
_Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be revised for
any adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_ ,
with any adjustment that is specifically attributable to Sensus USA and its US
subsidiaries allocated to Sensus USA, any adjustment that is specifically
attributable to the other Companies and their subsidiaries allocated to such
other Companies, and any adjustment that is not specifically attributable to
Sensus USA and its US subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the other Companies
and their subsidiaries, on the other hand, allocated pro rata between Sensus
USA and the other Companies in accordance with the allocation on _Exhibit B_.
Buyers shall send the revised Allocation to Sellers within thirty (30)
calendar days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.4_. Sellers and Buyers shall prepare and file their Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with the Allocation. Except as required by Applicable Law,
Sellers and Buyers agree that they will not take, or cause or permit to be
taken, any position on any Tax Return that would be inconsistent with,
prejudice or otherwise adversely affect the Allocation without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

 

2.6 _Withholding_. Buyers shall not deduct or withhold, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement unless such deduction or
withholding of Taxes is required under Applicable Law, including any payments
made through the Companies payroll system. In any case where Buyers determine
in good faith that deduction or withholding is required (other than for
payments made through the Companies payroll system), Buyers shall

 



-21-  use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Sellers at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to deducting or withholding any amount pursuant
to this _Section 2.6_ , and the parties shall cooperate to reduce or avoid
such deduction or withholding where possible. In the event any Applicable Law
requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payments,
Buyers shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall
remit the amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
or withheld and remitted with the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

Sellers hereby represent and warrant to Buyers that, except as set forth in
the Disclosure Schedule:

 

3.1 _Due Incorporation; Ownership of Shares; Capitalization_.

 

(a) Each Seller is duly organized or incorporated (as the case may be),
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept
is recognized) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties as they are now being owned, leased and
operated and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where failure to have such power and authority would not be material to the
Companies and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Company and each
Subsidiary is duly organized or incorporated (as the case may be), validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept is recognized) under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, which
jurisdiction is set forth in _Section 1.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Each
Company and each Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its respective assets and properties as they are now being
owned, leased and operated and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where failure to have such power and authority would
not be material to the Companies and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each
Company and each Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business as foreign
corporations or other business entities, and are in good standing (to the
extent such concept is recognized), in all of the jurisdictions in which the
conduct or nature of the Companies and the Subsidiaries business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Section
3.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Companies nor any of the
Subsidiaries owns any equity interest, partnership, membership or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable for the purchase of
or exchangeable for any such equity, partnership, membership or similar
interest, or is under any current or prospective obligation to form or
participate in, provide funds to, make any loan, capital contribution or other
investment in or assume any liability or obligation of, any Person other
than the Subsidiaries. Except for statutory qualifying shares as set forth in
_Section 1.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, each of the Subsidiaries is wholly-
owned by one or more Companies, either directly or indirectly. True
and complete copies of the

 



-22-  Governing Documents of each Company and each of the Subsidiaries, as
presently in effect, have been heretofore delivered or made available to
Buyers. Neither the Companies nor any of the Subsidiaries is in violation of
any of the provisions of their respective Governing Documents.

(b) Sellers are the legal and beneficial owner of the Shares and hold good,
valid and marketable title to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens. Sellers
have the right, authority and power to sell, assign and transfer the Shares to
Buyers. Upon the delivery of the Shares by Sellers to Buyers in the manner
contemplated in _ARTICLE II_ , and the payment by Buyers of the Initial
Purchase Price to Sellers, Buyers will acquire beneficial, legal and
marketable title to all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other
than restrictions to which Buyers may be subject under applicable securities
law).

(c) The Shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Companies. _Section 3.1(c)_ sets forth, for each Company, the amount of
its authorized capital stock or other equity or ownership interests, and the
record and beneficial owners of its outstanding capital stock or other equity
or ownership interests. _Section 1.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth,
for each Subsidiary with its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization in
the United States, the amount of its authorized capital stock or other equity
or ownership interests, and, for each Subsidiary, the amount of its
outstanding capital stock or other equity or ownership interests, and the
record and beneficial owners of its outstanding capital stock or other equity
or ownership interests. All of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, and in the case of the Subsidiaries, except as set forth in
_Section 1.3_ of the Disclosure Schedules, each such share or other equity or
ownership interest is owned by a Company or another Subsidiary, free and clear
of any Liens. None of the shares of capital stock or other equity or ownership
interests of the Companies or the Subsidiaries, including the Shares, were
issued in violation of any option, call option, right of first refusal, right
of first offer, preemptive rights, subscription rights or any similar right
under any provision of Applicable Law, the Governing Documents of the
Companies or the Subsidiaries or any Contract to which any of the Companies or
any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of the Companies or any of
the Subsidiaries is bound. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries is a
party to any voting trusts, proxies or other voting Contracts with respect to
the Shares or any equity interests of the Companies or any of
the Subsidiaries. Except for the Shares and except as set forth in _Section
3.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Companies and the Subsidiaries have
not issued or granted or agreed to issue or grant any: (i) shares of capital
stock or other equity or ownership interest; (ii) stock appreciation right,
phantom stock, interest in the ownership or earnings of any of the Companies
or any of the Subsidiaries or other equity equivalent or equity-based award or
right; (iii) options, warrants, rights (including call, put, preemptive,
subscription, exchange and/or conversion rights), convertible securities or
other agreements or commitments obligating any of the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell, or cause the issuance, transfer or
sale of, any equity interests of any of the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries or to make any payments in respect of the value of any shares of
any of the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries; or (iv) bond, debenture or
other Indebtedness having the right to vote or convertible or exchangeable
for securities having the right to vote. Except as set forth in _Section
3.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding obligations of
any of the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries to issue, sell or transfer or
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or that relate to the holding or
disposition of or that restrict the transfer of, the issued or unissued
capital stock or other equity or ownership interests of any of the Companies
or any of the Subsidiaries.

 



-23- 3.2 _Due Authorization_. Each Seller has full power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and its Related Agreements, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of

at the Closing will duly and validly execute and deliver) its Related
Agreements. This Agreement constitutes, and each Sellers Related Agreements

legal, valid and binding obligations of such Seller, as applicable, in
each case, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect which affect the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by equitable principles.

3.3 _Non-Contravention; Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) filings under
the HSR Act, (b) the Foreign Antitrust Approvals, (c) reports, filings,

delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement and its Related
Agreements will not (i) violate any law, regulation or order of any

Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Sellers or the Companies or
any of the Subsidiaries are bound or affected; (ii) require any notice,

Material Contract to which Sellers or any Company or any Subsidiary is a party
or by which any Seller, any Company or any Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties, assets or rights may be bound or affected, except in
the case of _clause (iv)_ , where any such violation, notice, filing, breach,
default, termination, amendment, acceleration, cancellation, imposition,
increase or creation would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



-24- 3.4 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Financial Statements, true and complete copies of which are set forth
in _Section 3.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule, have been prepared in accordance
with the books and records of the Companies and the Subsidiaries and GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except as set
forth in the footnotes attached thereto, and present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Companies and the Subsidiaries for the
periods covered thereby, except that interim financial statements omit
footnotes and are subject to year-end adjustments that will not, individually
or in the aggregate, be material. The inventories of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet (subject to reserves set
forth in the Latest Balance Sheet) and existing as of the Closing (subject to
reserves set forth in the books and records of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries at Closing) are or will be generally of a quantity usable and
salable in the ordinary course of business.

(b) There are no debts, liabilities or obligations, whether accrued or fixed,
absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured or determined or determinable,
which are required to be included in a balance sheet prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles, of the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries,
other than any such debts, liabilities or obligations (i) to the extent
accrued or reserved against in the Latest Balance Sheet, or (ii) incurred in
the ordinary course of business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries since
the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, in each case which would not, or would
not reasonably be expected to, be material to the Companies and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.5  _Absence of Changes_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.5_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, since March 31, 2016, (a) the Companies and the
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice, (b) there has not been any change, event or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (c) neither the Companies nor
any of the Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date of
this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
_Sections 5.2(a)_ through _(e)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(j)_ , _(m)_ , _(n)_ ,
_(q)_ or _(r)_.

 

3.6 _Title to Assets_. The Company and the Subsidiaries have good and valid
title to or a valid leasehold interest in all of their material assets,
including all of the assets reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet or acquired
in the ordinary course of business since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet,
except those sold or otherwise disposed of since the date of the
Latest Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and except to the extent the failure to have such title or interest
would not be material to the Companies and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
None of the assets owned or leased by the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries is subject to any Lien, other than Permitted Liens.

3.7 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) _Section 3.7_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list
as of the date of this Agreement of all of the Intellectual Property that is
registered or subject to an

 



-25-  application for registration by a Company or a Subsidiary (" _Registered
Intellectual Property_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 3.7_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, no Registered Intellectual Property has been abandoned,
canceled or adjudicated invalid, or is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
injunction, judgment, stipulation, decree, settlement or agreement restricting
its use.

 

(b) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.7_ of the Disclosure Schedule: (i) a
Company or a Subsidiary is the sole owner of the Registered Intellectual
Property, such ownership being free and clear of all Liens (except for
Permitted Liens), and neither the Companies nor any of the Subsidiaries has
granted any exclusive licenses to a third party in respect of any Owned
Intellectual Property; (ii) the Registered Intellectual Property is valid and
enforceable; (iii) the operation of the businesses of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries has not violated, infringed upon, or misappropriated any
Intellectual Property of any third party, and there are no pending, or, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened, claims (including cease and desist
letters, invitations to take a patent license and indemnification claims or
notices), proceedings or litigation related to Intellectual Property within
the last three (3) years; and (iv) to the Knowledge of Sellers, no third party
is materially infringing any Registered Intellectual Property.

 

(c) The Companies and the Subsidiaries take and have taken commercially
reasonable steps to (i) protect and maintain the Registered Intellectual
Property and the confidentiality of trade secrets; and (ii) protect the
security and operation of material software, code, applications, websites,
systems, networks used in the operation of any of their businesses, including
(x) engaging generally in the practice of entering into appropriate
confidentiality agreements with all officers, directors and employees and (y)
entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements with other Persons with
access to the Owned Intellectual Property. None of the trade secrets included
in the Owned Intellectual Property has been disclosed or authorized to be
disclosed by the Companies and the Subsidiaries to any Person other than to
employees or agents of the Companies or the Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the businesses of the Companies or the Subsidiaries and
pursuant to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement that reasonably
protects the interest of the Companies and the Subsidiaries in and to such
matters. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no unauthorized disclosure of any such
trade secrets has occurred and there has been no unauthorized theft, reverse
engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or other unauthorized disclosure of
or access to any source code for the Companies or the Subsidiaries
products.

(d) All Intellectual Property developed by or for the Companies and the
Subsidiaries and used in the operation of the businesses of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries was conceived, invented, reduced to practice, authored or
otherwise created solely by either employees of the Companies or
the Subsidiaries acting within the scope of their employment, or independent
contractors of the Companies or the Subsidiaries pursuant to agreements
containing an assignment of Intellectual Property to the Companies or the
Subsidiaries.

 

(e) The completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(i) materially alter or impair the ownership or right of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries to use (A) the Owned Intellectual Property or (B) any
Intellectual Property that a Company or a Subsidiary licenses or is otherwise
permitted by other Persons to use, or (ii) result in the release from escrow
or other delivery to any Person of any portion of the source code for any
Companies or the Subsidiaries products.

 



-26- (f) A Company or a Subsidiary owns or has rights to access and use all
internal electronic data processing, information, record keeping,
communications, telecommunications, account management, inventory management,
manufacturing systems and other internal computer systems (collectively, " _IT
Systems_ ") currently used by the Companies and the Subsidiaries and material
to the operation of the business as currently operated by the Companies and
the Subsidiaries. The Companies and the Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
steps in accordance with industry standards to secure the IT Systems from
unauthorized access or use by any Person. The IT Systems are adequate in all
material respects for their intended use and for the operation of the business
as currently operated by the Companies and the Subsidiaries, and, to the

information and documentary material which is required to be provided to or
reasonably requested by the FCC in connection with the applications and
filings contemplated by this _Section 5.6(a)_ , including any responses to FCC
inquiries. Both Parties shall prosecute the filing of the transfer documents
relating to the FCC Authorizations with all reasonable diligence in order to

appropriate in an effort to expedite the grant of such approvals by the FCC.
Each Party agrees promptly to evaluate any conditions and negotiate
resolutions with the FCC as may be appropriate to expedite the grant of such
consent by the FCC.

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the

of any FCC Authorizations.

 

(d) As soon as practicable, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companies and

FCC Authorizations and any renewals thereof, and (ii) permit Buyers to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with Buyers in advance of any

such meetings and conferences.

(f) The Parties agree that, solely with respect to the FCC Authorizations set
forth in _Section 3.14(f)(v)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Sellers may satisfy

Authorizations for MAS or NPCS spectrum of equivalent or more capacity in
order to replace any FCC Authorizations not approved for transfer by the FCC
under Section 310(d) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. §310(d); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if any such Contracts to purchase such spectrum
are not consummated prior to the Closing, the purchase price thereunder shall
be treated as a "current liability" for purposes of calculating
Working Capital; _provided_ , _further_ that such replacement spectrum
acquired prior to Closing shall be approved for transfer by the FCC under
Section 310(d) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. §310(d). In addition,
any "partition" of any FCC Authorization set forth in _Section 3.14(f)(v)_
of the Disclosure Schedule which has the effect of allowing the Companies and
the Subsidiaries to continue their existing activity in the applicable
market covered by such FCC Authorization shall satisfy the requirement to

of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
5.10_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 5.10_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this
_Section 5.10_ will create any third party beneficiary rights in any Employee
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to or shall otherwise constitute (i) a guarantee of continued
employment of any Employee, (ii) a prohibition on Buyers from terminating the
employment of any Employee, or (iii) the establishment or adoption of or an

OR THEREIN, THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY (A) AGREE THAT ANY
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION SHALL BE INSTITUTED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN NEW CASTLE COUNTY, DELAWARE, WHETHER A STATE
OR FEDERAL COURT; (B) AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION,

10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH

HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

 

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
The Parties agree that each Party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce the rights and
the obligations of the other Parties hereunder not only by an action or
actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief. Furthermore, the Parties agree that
each Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the obligations of the other
Parties hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an
action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable
relief. The right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither Sellers nor Buyers would have entered into this
Agreement. The Parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the Parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The Parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 10.12_ shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 

10.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If
the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any
term or provision hereof is

 



-65-  invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 

10.14 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.

 

10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and such
counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such counterpart, including those delivered
in electronic format, and copies produced therefrom shall have the same
effect as an originally signed counterpart. To the extent applicable, the
foregoing constitutes the election of the Parties to invoke any law
authorizing electronic signatures.

 

10.16 _Retention of Advisors_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or
in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, Sellers and their
shareholders shall have the right, at their election, to retain Mayer Brown
LLP and/or Conyers Dill and Pearman Limited to represent them in such matter,
even if such representation shall be adverse to Buyers, the Companies and/or
the Subsidiaries. Buyers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries, for themselves
and for their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably consent to any such representation in any such matter.
Buyers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries, for themselves and for their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any
actual or potential conflict arising from any representation regarding a
dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement in the event of:
(a) any adversity between the interests of Sellers and their shareholders, on
the one hand, and Buyers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, in any such dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement;
and/or (b) any communication between Mayer Brown LLP and/or Conyers Dill and
Pearman Limited and the Companies, the Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates or employees, whether privileged or not, or any other information
known to such counsel, by reason of such counsels representation of any of
the Companies or the Subsidiaries prior to Closing.

 

10.17 _Protected Communication_. The Parties to this Agreement agree that,
immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further action (a)
all right, title and interest of the Companies and any Subsidiary in and to
all Protected Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely
in Sellers and their successors in interest, and (b) any and all protections
from disclosure, including, but not limited to, attorney-client privileges and
work product protections, associated with or arising from any Protected
Communications that would have been exercisable by the Companies or any
Subsidiary shall thereupon be vested exclusively in Sellers and their
successors in interest and shall be exercised or waived solely as directed by
Sellers or

 



-66-  their successors in interest as between Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Companies and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand. None of Buyers, the
Companies, the Subsidiaries or any Person acting on any of their behalf
shall, without the prior written consent of Sellers or their successors in
interest, assert or waive or attempt to assert or waive any such protection
against disclosure, including, but not limited to, the attorney-client
privilege or work product protection, or to discover, obtain, use or disclose
or attempt to discover, obtain, use or disclose any Protected Communications
in any manner in connection with any dispute or Legal Proceeding relating
to or in connection with this Agreement, the events and negotiations leading
to this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_
, _however_ , the foregoing shall neither prohibit Buyers from seeking proper
discovery of such documents nor Sellers from asserting that such documents
are not discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney-client privileges
and work product protections have attached thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyers, the Companies
and the Subsidiaries and a third party other than a Party to this Agreement
after the Closing, the Companies and the Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of Protected Communications by
Sellers, Sellers shareholders or their respective representatives to such
third party. Sellers and their successors in interest shall have the right at
any time prior to or following the Closing to remove, erase, delete, disable,
copy or otherwise deal with any Protected Communications in whatever way they
desire.

10.18 _No Waiver of Privilege, Protection from Disclosure or Use_. The
Parties hereto understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including
the provisions of _Section 10.16_ and _Section 10.17_ regarding the assertions
of protection from disclosure and use, privilege and conflicts of interest,
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege or
other protection from disclosure or use. Each of the Parties understands and
agrees that it has undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of
Protected Communications. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Parties
understand and agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement could result in the inadvertent disclosure of information that
may be confidential, eligible to be subject to a claim of privilege, or
otherwise protected from disclosure. The Parties further understand and agree
that any disclosure of information that may be confidential, subject to a
claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure will not constitute
a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality, privilege, or
protection from disclosure, including, but not limited to, with respect
to information involving or concerning the same subject matter as the
disclosed information. The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to
return any inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing Party
promptly upon becoming aware of its existence. The Parties further agree that
promptly after the return of any inadvertently disclosed information, the
Party returning such information shall destroy any and all copies, summaries,
descriptions and/or notes of such inadvertently disclosed information,
including electronic versions thereof, and all portions of larger documents or
communications that contain such copies, summaries, descriptions and/or notes.

 

10.19 _Waiver of Claims Against Debt Financing Source Parties and Governing
Law and Forum for Any Actions Involving Debt Financing Source Parties_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Seller
agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that none of the Debt
Financing Source Parties shall have any liability to Sellers, the Companies or
their respective Affiliates (other than Buyers) relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the financing of the transactions

 



-67-  contemplated by this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and that neither Sellers, the Companies nor any of their
respective Affiliates (other than Buyers) will have any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source Parties under this Agreement and any other
agreement contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any commitments by the
Debt Financing Source Parties in respect of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject in all respects to the provisions of
any other agreement (including any commitment letter or definitive agreement
relating to any Debt Financing) between any Debt Financing Source Party and
any Party hereto, all matters relating to any action or claim against any Debt
Financing Source Party, and all matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Source
Parties in any way relating to the Debt Financing, shall be exclusively
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic law of the State
of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would
cause the application of law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt
Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable law jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each Party hereto waives any right to trial by jury with
respect to any action related to the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated thereby or arising out of any action, proceeding or
counterclaim against any Debt Financing Source Party.
