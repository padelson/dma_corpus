                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated October 26,
2005, is by and among PATRIOT HOLDING CORP., a Minnesota corporation
("Purchaser"), PATRIOT ACQUISITION CORP., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Sub"), and TRANSPORT CORPORATION OF AMERICA,
INC., a Minnesota corporation ("Seller").

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Seller (the "Seller Board"), based upon
the unanimous recommendation of a special committee thereof consisting solely of
independent directors (the "Special Committee"), has unanimously approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger of Sub
with and into Seller (the "Merger"), has determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable to, fair
to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Seller Common Stock (the
"Shareholders" and, each a "Shareholder") and has resolved (subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement) to recommend that the Shareholders vote for
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger;

     WHEREAS, prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser may offer to certain
management Shareholders the opportunity to contribute shares of Seller Common
Stock (the "Contributed Shares") to Purchaser in exchange for equity in
Purchaser (the "Contribution"), which are intended to be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a contribution of such Shareholders' Contributed Shares
to Purchaser pursuant to Section 351 of the Code;

     WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Purchaser and
Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain of Seller's shareholders are entering
into voting agreements with Seller, Purchaser and Sub of even date herewith
covering an aggregate number of shares and Seller Stock Options representing, at
the time of signing, 19.75% of Seller's outstanding shares of Seller Common
Stock, whereby they agree to support the Merger (the "Voting Agreements"");

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser and Sub have each
approved this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the Merger; and

     WHEREAS, Purchaser, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, is approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, as the sole shareholder of Sub.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

<PAGE>

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

     Section 1.01  THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA"), at the Effective Time, the
separate existence of Sub shall cease and Sub shall be merged with and into
Seller (Sub and Seller are sometimes referred to herein as the "Constituent
Corporations"). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Sub shall cease and Seller shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the "Continuing Corporation") and shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of
Purchaser.

     Section 1.02  EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") in such form as
required by the relevant provisions of the MBCA shall be duly prepared,
executed, and acknowledged by the Constituent Corporations, and thereafter
delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota as provided in the
MBCA. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota or at such later
time thereafter as is provided in the Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time").

     Section 1.03  CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Minneapolis time, on a date to be specified by Purchaser
and Seller, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver (by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof)
of all the conditions set forth in Article VII (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., 2800 LaSalle Plaza, 800
LaSalle Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402-2015, unless another date or place
is agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller. All actions taken at the
Closing shall be deemed to have been taken simultaneously at the time the last
of any such actions is taken or completed.

     Section 1.04  EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 302A.641 subd. 2 of the MBCA.

     Section 1.05  ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS. The Articles of
Incorporation of Seller in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be, from and after the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Continuing Corporation (the "Surviving Charter"), until amended as provided in
the Surviving Charter or by applicable law. The Bylaws of Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation (the "Surviving Bylaws"), until
amended in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws or by
applicable law.

     Section 1.06  OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The officers and directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers and directors of
the Continuing Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

                                   ARTICLE II
                     CONTRIBUTION; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     Section 2.01  CONTRIBUTION OF SHARES. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any Contributed Shares to be contributed by certain Shareholders to
Purchaser pursuant to the Contribution shall be contributed by such Shareholders
to Purchaser in exchange for equity of Purchaser, with the equity of Purchaser
to be issued in exchange for each Contributed Share having a value equal to the
Merger Consideration, and shall be on terms and conditions mutual acceptable to
Purchaser and such Shareholders, in lieu of payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to the Contributed Shares.

     Section 2.02  CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Shareholders or holders
of any capital stock of Sub:

          (a)      CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each share of the capital stock of Sub
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
     converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
     Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Continuing Corporation.

          (b)      EXCHANGE RATIO FOR SELLER COMMON STOCK. Each share of Seller
     Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     (other than the Contributed Shares and the shares to be cancelled or
     converted pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.06) shall be converted
     into the right to receive $10.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
     Consideration").

          (c)      SELLER COMMON STOCK HELD BY PURCHASER OR SUB. Each share of
     Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time and held by Purchaser or Sub shall be cancelled without any
     consideration being paid therefor.

     The Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any
     stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, exchange, subdivision,
     combination of, or other similar change in Seller Common Stock following
     the date of this Agreement. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Seller
     Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
     canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and holders of certificates
     which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Seller
     Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with
     respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
     surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.05 (other than
     as set forth in Section 2.01, Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.06).

     Section 2.03  SELLER STOCK OPTIONS.

          (a)      Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Seller Common
     Stock (a "Seller Stock Option") under Seller's 1986 Stock Option Plan, as
     amended, 1995 Stock Plan, as amended, and the Non-Plan Non-Qualified Stock
     Option Agreement dated November 12, 2001 by and between Seller and Michael
     J. Paxton (the "Seller Option Plans"), whether vested or unvested, shall
     either be exercised by the holder thereof prior to the Effective Time or be
     cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for payment
     of an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of unexercised
     shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller Stock Option
     immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
     Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Seller Stock
     Option.

                                       3
<PAGE>

          (b)      Prior to the Effective Time, the Seller Board (or, if
     appropriate, a committee administering the stock plans of Seller) shall
     amend Seller's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Seller ESPP") to halt
     purchases under the Seller ESPP such that no issuances of any shares of
     Seller Common Stock shall be made following the date of this Agreement.

          (c)      Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed by the
     parties, Seller and the Seller Board (or, if appropriate, a committee
     administering the stock plans of Seller) shall take all actions reasonably
     necessary prior to or as of the Effective Time such that each of the Seller
     Option Plans, and any other plan, program or arrangement with any current
     or former employee, officer, director or consultant providing for the
     issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital stock of
     Seller, shall terminate as of the Effective Time. Seller and the Seller
     Board (or, if appropriate, a committee administering the stock plans of
     Seller) shall take all reasonably necessary actions to ensure that,
     following the Effective Time, no current or former employee, officer,
     director or consultant shall have any option to acquire any shares of
     Seller Common Stock or any other equity interest in Seller under the Seller
     Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement maintained by
     Seller.

     Section 2.04  TAX WITHHOLDING. Purchaser or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Shareholder or other person such amounts as Purchaser or
the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the
"Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Purchaser or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Shareholder or other person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Purchaser or the Paying Agent.

     Section 2.05  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

          (a)      At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit,
     or shall cause to be deposited, with LaSalle Bank, N.A. (the "Paying
     Agent"), for the benefit of the Shareholders, for exchange in accordance
     with this Section 2.05, cash in an amount required to be paid pursuant to
     this Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
     Fund").

          (b)      After the Effective Time (and in any event within two
     business days of the Effective Time), Purchaser shall cause the Paying
     Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates (i)
     a letter of transmittal in customary form which shall specify that delivery
     shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
     pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
     be in such form and have such other provisions as Purchaser and Seller may
     reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time and (ii) instructions for
     effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
     Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
     Paying Agent, together with a duly executed and completed, in accordance
     with its terms, letter of transmittal, and such other documents as may
     reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
     shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the amount of cash which
     the number of shares of Seller Common Stock previously represented by such
     Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
     this Article II and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
     cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration.
     In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Seller Common Stock
     which is not registered on the transfer records of Seller, payment of the
     Merger Consideration may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate
     representing such shares of Seller Common Stock held by such transferee is
     presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
     evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
     transfer taxes have been paid.

                                       4
<PAGE>

          (c)      In case of any lost, mislaid, stolen, or destroyed
     Certificate, the holder thereof may be required, as a condition precedent
     to the delivery to such holder of the consideration described in Section
     2.02, to deliver to Purchaser a bond in such reasonable sum as Purchaser
     may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
     Paying Agent, Purchaser, or the Continuing Corporation with respect to the
     Certificate alleged to have been lost, mislaid, stolen, or destroyed.

          (d)      After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
     stock transfer books of the Continuing Corporation of the shares of Seller
     Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
     If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Continuing
     Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
     consideration described in Section 2.02.

          (e)      Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed
     to holders of Certificates 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
     delivered to Purchaser, upon demand therefor, and holders of Certificates
     who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.05 shall thereafter
     look only to Purchaser for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
     such shares of Seller Common Stock, without any interest thereon.

          (f)      None of Purchaser, Sub, the Continuing Corporation or the
     Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the
     Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
     abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not
     have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or
     immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
     would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
     Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
     applicable laws, become the property of Purchaser, free and clear of all
     claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

          (g)      The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund,
     as directed by Purchaser, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
     resulting from such investments shall be paid to Purchaser upon termination
     of the Exchange Fund pursuant to this Article II.

     Section 2.06  DISSENTING SHARES.

          (a)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article II,
     shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time and held by a Shareholder who has not voted in favor of the
     Merger and who has properly exercised dissenters' rights in respect of such
     shares of Seller Common Stock in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and
     302A.473 of the MBCA, shall not be converted into or represent a right to
     receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.02, but shall be
     entitled to receive the fair value of the shares represented thereby in
     accordance with Section 302A.473; provided, however, that, if any such
     Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses
     such Shareholder's dissenters' rights, each such Shareholder's shares of
     Seller Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of
     the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
     without any interest thereon, pursuant to Section 2.02. Shares of Seller
     Common Stock in respect of which dissenters' rights have been exercised
     shall be treated in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the
     MBCA.

          (b)      Seller shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any demands
     received by Seller, along with copies of all documents with respect to each
     such demand, for the exercise of dissenters' rights and the opportunity to
     participate jointly with Seller in all negotiations and proceedings with
     respect to such demands. Seller will not voluntarily make any payment with
     respect to any demands delivered to Seller in connection with the exercise
     of dissenters' rights and will not, except with the prior written consent
     of Purchaser, settle or offer to settle any such demands. If, after the
     Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
     loses the dissenters' rights, such shares of Seller Common Stock shall be
     treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right
     to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.02.

                                  ARTICLE III
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

     Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser and Sub that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as set forth in the
disclosure schedule delivered by Seller to Purchaser on or before the date of
this Agreement (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule"). The Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the disclosures in any
paragraph shall qualify only the corresponding paragraph in this Article III,
except where the information in any such section is disclosed in such a manner
to make its relevance to any other representation or warranty readily apparent,
in which case such section shall be deemed to also qualify such other
representation and warranty.

     Section 3.01 ORGANIZATION OF SELLER. Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries
(as defined in Section 10.01) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing,
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
has all requisite corporate power to own, lease, and operate its property and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on

                                       6

Seller. For the purposes of any provision of this Agreement, a "Material Adverse
Effect" with respect to any party shall be deemed to occur if any event, change,
effect, condition, occurrence or development, individually or in the aggregate
with such other events, changes, effects, conditions, occurrences or
developments, has occurred which would have or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (a) the business, assets (including intangible
assets), liabilities (contingent or otherwise), results of operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole or (b) the ability of such party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that a Material Adverse
Effect shall not include any event, change, effect, condition, occurrence or
development directly or indirectly arising out of or attributable to (i)
conditions, events, or circumstances generally affecting the economy as a whole
or Seller's industry as a whole, but only to the extent that any such condition,
event or circumstance does not have a disproportionate effect on Seller as
compared to its competitors, (ii) any event, change, effect, condition,
occurrence or development resulting from or arising out of the public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or (iii) any event, change, effect, condition, occurrence or development
caused by the taking of any action required by this Agreement or the taking of
any action by Seller that has been approved in writing by Purchaser. Except as
set forth in the Seller SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.04), neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other business association
or entity excluding securities in any publicly traded company held for
investment by Seller and comprising less than one percent of the outstanding
stock of such company.

     Section 3.02  SELLER CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

          (a)      The authorized capital stock of Seller consists of 15,000,000
     shares of Common Stock ("Seller Common Stock") and 150,000 shares of
     Preferred Stock ("Seller Preferred Stock"). On September 30, 2005, (i)
     6,563,636 shares of Seller Common Stock were outstanding, all of which were
     validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable, and no other shares of
     Seller Common Stock had been issued as of such date, (ii) 700,505 shares of
     Seller Common Stock were subject to outstanding stock options under the
     Seller Option Plans and 59,115 shares of Seller Common Stock were reserved
     for future grants under the Seller Option Plans, (iii) 1,346 shares of
     Seller Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to options
     presently accrued under the Seller ESPP and 58,485 shares of Seller Common
     Stock were reserved for future issuance under the Seller ESPP, and (iv) an
     aggregate of 75,000 shares of Seller's Series A Junior Participating
     Preferred Stock ("Seller Junior Preferred Stock") were reserved for future
     issuance pursuant to the Rights Agreement, as amended, dated as of February
     25, 1997, between Seller and Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., as Rights Agent
     (the "Seller Rights Agreement"). Since September 30, 2005, no shares of
     Seller Common Stock have been issued except pursuant to the exercise of
     options granted under the Seller Option Plans or pursuant to the Seller
     ESPP. None of the shares of Seller Preferred Stock are issued and
     outstanding. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Seller
     or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire any
     shares of Seller Common Stock or the capital stock of any Subsidiary or to
     provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
     contribution, or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or any other entity. All
     of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Seller's Subsidiaries
     are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable and all
     such shares are owned by Seller free and clear of all security interests,
     liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in Seller's voting rights,
     charges, or other encumbrances of any nature.

                                       7

          (b)      Except for outstanding warrants, options granted under the
     Seller Option Plans or as reserved for future grants of options or rights
     under the Seller Option Plans, shares reserved for issuance under the
     Seller ESPP, or for the shares of Seller Junior Preferred Stock reserved
     for issuance under the Seller Rights Agreement, there are no equity
     securities of any class of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
     security exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities,
     issued, reserved for issuance, or outstanding. Except as set forth in this
     Section 3.02, there are no options, warrants, equity securities, calls,
     rights, commitments, or agreements of any character to which Seller or any
     of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound obligating Seller or
     any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver, or sell, or cause to be issued,
     delivered, or sold, additional shares of capital stock of Seller or any of
     its Subsidiaries or obligating Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
     extend, accelerate the vesting of, or enter into any such option, warrant,
     equity security, call, right, commitment, or agreement. Seller is not a
     party to, nor is Seller aware of, any voting agreement, voting trust,
     proxy, or other agreements or understandings with respect to the shares of
     capital stock of Seller or any agreement, arrangement, or understanding
     providing for registration rights with respect to any shares of capital
     stock of Seller.

     Section 3.03  AUTHORITY, NO CONFLICT, REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.

          (a)      Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to
     enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
     by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
     Voting Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
     action on the part of Seller, subject only to the approval of this
     Agreement and the Merger by Seller's shareholders under the MBCA. This
     Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and constitutes
     the valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable in accordance with
     its terms.

          (b)      Subject to approval of this Agreement and the Merger by
     Seller's shareholders, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
     Seller does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or
     breach of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of
     Seller, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
     without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to right
     of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of any obligation or loss of
     any benefit) under any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any note,
     bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract, or other agreement, instrument,
     or obligation to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
     which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, and
     where such violation, breach or default would have a Material Adverse
     Effect on Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or on the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) conflict with or violate any
     permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute,
     law, ordinance, rule, or regulation applicable to Seller or any of its
     Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets where such
     conflict or violation would have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller, any
     of its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c)      No material consent, approval, order, or authorization of, or
     registration, declaration, or filing with, any court, administrative
     agency, or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality
     ("Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to Seller or any of
     its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
     Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
     except for (i) the filing of the pre-merger notification report under the
     Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR
     Act"), (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger, (iii) the filing of the
     Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.17 below) with the Securities and
     Exchange Commission ("SEC") in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and (iv) such consents,
     approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, and filings

          (a)      Seller has filed all forms, reports, and documents required
     to be filed by Seller with the SEC since January 1, 2002 (including all
     exhibits, notes, and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
     reference therein) (collectively, the "Seller SEC Reports"). The Seller SEC
     Reports (i) at the time filed, with respect to all of the Seller SEC
     Reports other than registration statements filed under the Securities Act
     of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or at the time of their
     respective effective dates, with respect to registration statements filed
     under the Securities Act, complied in all material respects with the
     applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the
     case may be, and (ii) did not at the time filed or at the time of their
     respective effective dates, as the case may be (or if amended or superseded
     by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
     filing), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
     material fact required to be stated in such Seller SEC Reports or necessary
     in order to make the statements in such Seller SEC Reports, in the light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of
     Seller's Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports, or other
     documents with the SEC.

          (b)      Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
     each case, any related notes) contained in the Seller SEC Reports at the
     time filed or at the time of their respective effective dates, as the case
     may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
     published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
     prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
     may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case
     of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly
     presented the consolidated financial position of Seller and its
     Subsidiaries at the respective dates and the consolidated results of their
     operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
     unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
     recurring year-end adjustments. The audited balanced sheet of Seller as of
     December 31, 2004 is referred to herein as the "Seller Balance Sheet."

          (c)      Seller has complied in all material respects with the
     applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related
     rules and regulations promulgated under such act or the Exchange Act.
     Seller has previously made available to Purchaser copies of all
     certificates delivered by officers and employees of Seller, including
     Seller's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to the Seller
     Board or any committee thereof pursuant to the certification requirements
     relating to Seller's 2004 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
     The management of Seller has (i) implemented disclosure controls and
     procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
     that material information relating to Seller and its Subsidiaries is made
     known to the management of Seller by others within those entities and (ii)
     disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to the Seller's outside
     auditors and the audit committee of the Seller Board (A) all significant
     deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
     Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Seller's
     ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any
     fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
     who, in each case, have a significant role in Seller's internal control
     over financial reporting.

          (d)      As used in this Section 3.04, the term "file" shall be
     broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or information
     is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

     Section 3.05  NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as disclosed in the Seller
SEC Reports, Seller and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities, either
accrued or contingent (whether or not required to be reflected in financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), and
whether due or to become due, the effect of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) liabilities
reflected in the Seller Balance Sheet and (ii) normal or recurring liabilities
incurred since December 31, 2004, in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices.

     Section 3.06  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since the date of the
Seller Balance Sheet, Seller and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and, since such date, there has not occurred (i) any Material Adverse
Effect on Seller and any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any damage,
destruction, or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to any
property of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries having a Material Adverse Effect
on Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) any material change by
Seller in its accounting methods, principles, or practices, or (iv) any material
revaluation by Seller of any of its material assets.

Section 3.07      TAXES.

          (a)      All Tax Returns (as defined herein) required to be filed by
     Seller or any of its Subsidiaries have been duly filed on a timely basis.
     All such Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all material respects.
     All Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, and all material Taxes
     otherwise required to be paid by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries have
     been timely paid. All Taxes due and payable by Seller and its Subsidiaries
     have been adequately provided for in the financial statements of Seller and
     its Subsidiaries for all periods ending through the date hereof.

          (b)      There are no audits or administrative proceedings, court
     proceedings or claims pending against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
     with respect to any Taxes, no assessment, deficiency or adjustment has been
     asserted or proposed or threatened with respect to any Taxes or Tax Return
     of or with respect to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been
     paid in full or fully resolved in favor of the taxpayer, and there are no
     liens for Taxes upon the assets or properties of Seller or any of its
     Subsidiaries, except liens for Taxes not yet due. No issue has been raised
     by any taxing authority in any presently pending Tax audit that could
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or any
     of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time.

          (c)      There are not in force any waivers of agreements,
     arrangements, or understandings by or with respect to Seller or any of its
     Subsidiaries of or for an extension of time for the assessment or payment
     of any Taxes. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has received a
     written ruling of a taxing authority relating to Taxes or entered into a
     written and legally binding agreement with a taxing authority relating to
     Taxes that would have a continuing effect after the Closing Date.

     extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has
     not yet been filed, or executed or filed any power of attorney with any
     taxing authority.

          (e)      Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid in
     all material respects all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
     connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
     independent contractor or other third party.

          (f)      Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
     under any agreement (either with any person or any taxing authority) with
     respect to Taxes.

          (g)      Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted
     either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within
     the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
     qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code since the
     effective date of Section 355(e) of the Code.

          (h)      Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) been a
     member of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section
     1504 of the Code, other than the affiliated group of which Seller is the
     common parent or (ii) any material liability for the Taxes of any other
     person (other than Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) under any state,
     local or foreign law, as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
     otherwise.

                                       11
<PAGE>

          (i)      No written claim that could give rise to Taxes has been made
     by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Seller or any of its
     Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that Seller or any of its
     Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.

          (j)      The Seller has provided or made available to Purchaser
     correct and complete copies of (i) all income and franchise Tax Returns of
     Seller and its Subsidiaries for the preceding three taxable years and (ii)
     any audit report issued within the last three years (or otherwise with
     respect to any audit or proceeding in progress) relating to income or
     franchise Taxes of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (k)      Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a
     transaction that has been identified by published guidance as a listed
     transaction under Treas. Reg. Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

          (l)      Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United
     States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
     897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
     897(c)(l)(A)(ii) of the Code.

          (m)      For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Taxes" shall mean taxes
     of any kind (including those measured by or referred to as income,
     franchise, gross receipts, sales, use, ad valorem, profits, license,
     withholding, payroll, employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation,
     premium, value added, property, windfall profits, customs, duties or
     similar fees, assessments or charges of any kind whatsoever) together with
     any interest and any penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts
     imposed by any taxing authority with respect thereto, domestic or foreign
     and shall include any transferee or successor liability in respect of taxes
     (whether by contract or otherwise) and any several liability in respect of
     any tax as a result of being a member of any affiliated, consolidated,
     combined, unitary or similar group and (ii) "Tax Returns" shall mean any
     return, report, claim for refund, estimate, information return or statement
     or other similar document relating to or required to be filed with any
     taxing authority with respect to Taxes, including any schedule or
     attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

     Section 3.08  PROPERTIES.

          (a)      Seller has provided to Purchaser a true and complete list of
     all real property owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries and real property
     leased by Seller or its Subsidiaries pursuant to leases (collectively, the
     "Leases" and, together with the owned real property, the "Real Property"),
     and the name of the lessor, the date of the Lease and each amendment to the
     Lease, and the aggregate annual rental or other fees payable under any such
     Lease. The Real Property has access, sufficient for the conduct of the
     business of Seller and its Subsidiaries as now conducted or as presently
     proposed by Seller to be conducted, to public roads and to all utilities
     used in the operation of the business at that location.

                                       12
<PAGE>

          (b)      Seller holds a valid and existing leasehold interest under
     each of the Leases. Seller has delivered to Purchaser complete and accurate
     copies of each of the Leases (including all notices exercising renewal,
     expansion, termination or other material rights under the Leases), and none
     of the Leases has been modified in any material respect, except to the
     extent that the copies delivered to Purchaser disclose such modifications.
     Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has leased or sublet, as lessor,
     sublessor, licensor or the like, any of the Real Property. No Lease is
     subject to any prime, ground or master lease, mortgage, deed of trust or
     other encumbrance or interest which would entitle the interest holder to
     interfere with or disturb Seller's or any Subsidiary's rights under the
     Lease while Seller or such Subsidiary is not in default under the Lease.
     Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary is in material default, and no
     circumstances exist which, if unremedied, would, either with or without
     notice or the passage of time or both, result in such material default by
     Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the Leases; nor, to the
     Knowledge of Seller, is any other party to any of the Leases in material
     default.

          (c)      Seller and its Subsidiaries own, or lease under valid leases,
     all of the buildings, fixtures, leasehold improvements, computers,
     equipment and other tangible and intangible assets, including, without
     limitation, all trucks, cabs and other rolling stock, necessary for the
     conduct of the business of Seller or its Subsidiaries as now conducted and
     presently proposed to be conducted, all of which, collectively, are in good
     condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are usable in
     the ordinary course of business.

          (d)      Except for leased or licensed property, Seller and its
     Subsidiaries own good and marketable title to each of the properties and
     assets used by Seller or its Subsidiaries, located on the premises of
     Seller or its Subsidiaries, or reflected on the Seller Balance Sheet or
     acquired since the date thereof.

     Section 3.09  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

          (a)      Seller and its Subsidiaries own or license all patents,
     trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, any applications for
     the foregoing, and any tangible or intangible proprietary information (the
     "Intellectual Property") that is material or necessary to its business.
     Schedule 3.09 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists and describes all
     registered Intellectual Property, copyrights and proprietary software owned
     or licensed by Seller or any Subsidiary, including identifying each
     jurisdiction in which applications have been filed or rights issued. All of
     the Intellectual Property rights are valid and enforceable in all material
     respects, and Seller has no Knowledge of facts showing, and has received no
     written notice of any party asserting, that any of the Intellectual
     Property rights are invalid or not enforceable. The business of Seller and
     its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe, misuse,
     misappropriate, or conflict with the Intellectual Property rights of others
     in a way that is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Either Seller or its Subsidiaries owns and
     possesses all right, title and interest, or holds a valid license, in and
     to all of the Intellectual Property in all material respects, free and
     clear of any material encumbrance, without any material conflict with the
     rights of others, and has taken all action necessary to protect the
     Intellectual Property in all material respects. No claim by any third party
     contesting the validity of any of the Intellectual Property has been made,
     received, is currently outstanding or, to the Knowledge of Seller, is

          (b)      Seller or any of its Subsidiaries owns or has a valid and
     enforceable right to use all computer software and systems used by Seller
     or any of its Subsidiaries in the operation of their business as presently
     conducted or proposed to be conducted, without taking into account the
     transactions contemplated hereby ("Internal Use Software"), without any
     conflict with the rights of others. Seller and any of its Subsidiaries do
     not use, rely on or contract with any Person to provide services bureau,
     outsourcing or other computer processing services which are material to
     Seller or its Subsidiaries, in lieu of or in addition to their use of the
     Internal Use Software. Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has the right to
     use all databases Seller and its Subsidiaries use internally (the

     any written notice alleging that Seller's or any Subsidiary's use,
     reproduction or distribution of the Databases infringes any third party's
     rights. Neither Seller nor the Subsidiaries sell or license the Databases
     to third parties. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has done
     anything to compromise the secrecy, confidentiality, ownership, rights in

     Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable security measures to protect the
     secrecy, confidentiality and value of the Intellectual Property.

     threat that it has breached, any of the terms and conditions of any
     agreement, contract, or commitment required to be filed as an exhibit to
     the Seller SEC Reports ("Seller Material Contracts") in such a manner as
     would permit any other party to cancel or terminate the same or would
     permit any other party to seek material damages from Seller under any
     Seller Material Contract. Each Seller Material Contract that has not
     expired or been terminated is in full force and effect and is not subject
     to any material default thereunder of which Seller is aware by any party
     obligated to Seller pursuant to Seller Material Contracts.

          (b)      Except as set forth in Seller SEC Reports filed prior to the

     Subsidiaries in excess of $100,000, (ii) agreement with any executive
     officer or other key employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries the
     benefits of which are contingent or vest, or the terms of which are

     or any of its Subsidiaries of the nature contemplated by this Agreement,
     (iii) agreement with respect to any executive officer or other key employee
     of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries providing any term of employment or

     contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
     will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement, (v) agreement that would restrict Seller's or any
     Subsidiary's ability to compete in any business in any location, (vi)
     agreements concerning a partnership or joint venture, (vii) loan
     agreements, promissory notes, security agreements, deeds of trust and other
     agreements relating to indebtedness for borrowed money or deferred purchase
     price of property (other than trade payables arising in the ordinary course
     of business), (viii) any agreement relating to business acquisitions or
     dispositions not yet consummated, including any separate Tax or
     indemnification agreements, and (ix) any other agreement that would be
     required to be filed as an exhibit to an Annual Report on Form 10-K of
     Seller if Seller were to file such a report on the date of this Agreement
     (assuming for this purpose that the fiscal year covered thereby ended on
     the date of this Agreement).

     material violation or breach of or default under, or has received notice of
     any material violation or breach of or default under, any such Seller
     Material Contracts or other agreements required to be disclosed in Section
     3.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
     other party to a Seller Material Contract or any other agreement required
     to be disclosed in Section 3.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is in
     material violation or breach of or default under any such Seller Material
     Contract or other such agreement, as the case may be.

     the extent storage tanks exist on or under any facility or real estate
     currently owned or leased by Seller, such storage tanks have been duly

     Knowledge of Seller the facilities or real estate currently or previously
     owned or leased by Seller within the last three years do not contain any
     condition which could reasonably be expected to result in a material claim,
     right of action or recovery against Seller by any person or entity under
     any Environmental Law.

                               CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

     Section 5.01  COVENANTS OF SELLER. During the period from the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
or the Effective Time, Seller agrees as to itself and its Subsidiaries (except
to the extent that Purchaser shall otherwise consent in writing), to carry on
its business in the usual, regular, and ordinary course in substantially the
same manner as previously conducted, to pay its debts and taxes when due subject
to good faith disputes over such debts or taxes (it being understood payment of
fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be permitted; provided, that such fees and expenses, and any
other amounts payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than any fees and expenses payable to Stephens Inc. pursuant to
the terms of its engagement letter with Seller dated June 9, 2005 (as amended on
August 10, 2005 and October 14, 2005, collectively, the "Stephens Letter"),
shall not exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate), to pay or perform other
obligations when due, and, to the extent consistent with such business, to use
all reasonable effort consistent with past practices and policies to preserve
intact its present business organization, to keep available the services of its
present officers and key employees and preserve its relationships with
customers, suppliers, franchisees, distributors, licensors, licensees, and
others having business dealings with it, to the end that its goodwill and
ongoing businesses shall be unimpaired at the Effective Time. Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser of any event or occurrence not in the ordinary course
of business of Seller. Without limitation of the foregoing, during such period
of time, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall not
(and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to), without the prior written
consent of Purchaser:

          (a)      declare or pay any dividends on or make any other
     distributions (whether in cash, stock, or property) in respect of any of
     its capital stock or split, combine, or reclassify any of its capital stock
     or issue or authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of,

     agreements or commitments of any character obligating it to issue, any such
     shares or other convertible securities, other than the issuance of shares
     upon the exercise of Seller Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof
     under the Seller Option Plans, the issuance of shares upon the exercise of
     options accrued as of the date of this Agreement under the Seller ESPP, and
     issuances of securities under the Seller Rights Agreement, as amended to
     date;

     or by purchasing a substantial equity interest in or substantial portion of
     the assets of, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
     partnership, association, or other business organization or division, or

     individually or in the aggregate, to the business of Seller and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

          (d)      sell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of any of its

     the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

          (e)      (i) increase or agree to increase the compensation payable or

     of Seller in accordance with past practices and except for the acceleration
     of unvested Seller Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof, (ii)
     increase or agree to increase the compensation payable or to become payable
     to directors or officers of Seller or grant any additional severance or
     termination pay to, or enter into any employment or severance agreements
     with such directors or officers, (iii) grant any severance or termination
     pay to, or enter into any employment or severance agreement with, any
     employee, except in accordance with past practices, (iv) enter into any
     collective bargaining agreement, (v) establish, adopt, enter into, or amend
     any bonus, profit sharing, thrift, compensation, stock option, restricted

     severance, or other plan, trust, fund, policy, or arrangement for the
     benefit of any directors, officers, or employees, or (vi) hire any new
     executive employee;

     securities of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or guarantee any debt
     securities of others;

          (h)      amend or propose to amend its charter documents or Bylaws;

          (i)      make any capital expenditure or commitment for which it is

     dated January 21, 2005 and modified on September 21, 2005, which 2005
     Capital Budget as modified has been delivered to Purchaser prior to the
     date of this Agreement;

                                       23
<PAGE>

          (j)      enter into any Seller Material Contracts or amend or modify
     any existing Seller Material Contracts, or engage in any new transaction

     Subsidiaries;

          (k)      settle or compromise any litigation (whether or not commenced
     prior to the date of this Agreement), other than settlements involving

     individually or $500,000 in the aggregate not fully recoverable from
     insurance;

          (l)      change its fiscal year, revalue any of its material assets,

     required by GAAP or applicable Law;

          (m)      except to the extent required by applicable law, make any

     limitations with respect to material Taxes; or

          (n)      take, or agree in writing or otherwise to take, any of the
     actions described in Sections (a) through (j) above, or any action which is
     reasonably likely to make any of Seller's representations or warranties
     contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect on
     the date made (to the extent so limited) or as of the Effective Time.

     Section 5.02  COOPERATION. Subject to compliance with applicable law, from
the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of Purchaser and Seller shall
confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the
other party to report material operational matters and the general status of
ongoing operations and shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel
with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger, and the transactions contemplated

arrangement of any financing to be consummated in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including participation in meetings, due
diligence sessions, the execution and delivery of the Commitment Letters,
underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents, other

                       ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

Section 6.01      NO SOLICITATION.

          (a)      Seller shall not (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly
     encourage any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or are reasonably
     likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, other than the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions
     concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person or entity
     relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) agree to, approve, or
     recommend any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing
     contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller, the Seller Board, or the
     Special Committee from furnishing non-public information to, or entering
     into discussions or negotiations with, any person, entity or group of
     persons or entities (a "Third Party"), or taking any other action deemed
     necessary, in connection with an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
     by such Third Party or recommending an unsolicited bona fide written
     Acquisition Proposal to the Shareholders, if and only to the extent that
     the Special Committee determines in good faith after consultation with
     outside legal counsel that such action is necessary for it to comply with
     its fiduciary duties to the Shareholders under applicable law.
     Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if at any time prior to obtaining
     Shareholder Approval, (a) Seller has received a bona fide unsolicited
     written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
     Section 6.01, and the Special Committee has reasonably determined in good
     faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then
     Seller may take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of this Section
     6.01(a); provided, however, that Seller (A) will provide notice to
     Purchaser of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal within twenty-four
     (24) hours after any member of the Special Committee or Stephens Inc. has
     knowledge of the receipt thereof, (B) will not disclose any information to
     such Third Party without entering into an acceptable confidentiality
     agreement containing terms no more favorable to such Third Party than the
     terms set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and (C) will promptly
     provide to Purchaser any non-public information concerning Seller provided
     to such Third Party which was not previously provided to Purchaser. Upon
     execution of this Agreement, Seller shall (whether directly or indirectly
     through its representatives), and Seller shall direct and use reasonable
     best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective representatives
     to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
     discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
     Third Parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could
     reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly
     request that all confidential information with respect thereto furnished by
     or on behalf of Seller be returned or destroyed. Without limiting the
     foregoing, Seller agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth
     in this Section 6.01(a) by any of Seller's representatives or its
     Subsidiaries' representatives, whether or not purporting to act on behalf
     of Seller, shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.01(a) by Seller.

                                       25
<PAGE>

          (b)      Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly (and no later than 24
     hours) after receipt by any member of the Special Committee or Stephens
     Inc. of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information
     in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
     books, or records of Seller by any person or entity that informs Seller
     that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Seller
     shall inform Purchaser on a current basis of the status and terms of any
     discussions regarding, or relating to, any such Acquisition Proposal with a
     Third Party (including amendments and proposed amendments) and, as promptly
     as practicable, of any change in the price, structure or form of the
     consideration or material terms of and conditions regarding the Acquisition
     Proposal. In fulfilling its obligations under this Section 6.01(b), Seller
     shall provide promptly to Purchaser copies of all written proposals. All
     information provided by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this Section
     6.01(b) shall be kept confidential by Purchaser in accordance with the
     terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Immediately upon determination by
     the Seller Board that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
     Proposal, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written notice advising
     Purchaser that the Seller Board has so determined, specifying the terms and
     conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the amount that the
     Shareholders will receive per share of Seller Common Stock (valuing any
     non-cash consideration at what the Seller Board determines in good faith,
     after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
     reputation, to be the fair value of the non-cash consideration)) and the
     identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal, and providing
     Purchaser at such time with a copy of the Superior Proposal and all
     documents relating thereto.

          (c)      The Seller Board has adopted a resolution resolving to
     recommend that the Shareholders vote for the approval of this Agreement
     (the "Seller Recommendation"). The Seller Board shall not (i) withdraw,
     qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in
     each case, in a manner adverse to Purchaser, the Seller Recommendation or
     make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Seller
     Shareholders' Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Seller
     Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
     position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
     adverse modification of the Seller Recommendation), subject to Section
     6.01(d) (any such action, a "Change in Recommendation"), (ii) approve or
     recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
     Proposal and/or (iii) enter into (or cause Seller or any of its
     Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
     acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
     Proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement entered into
     in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.01(a)) or (B) requiring
     Seller to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval,
     (x) the Seller Board may effect a Change in Recommendation if the Seller
     Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
     legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
     that it would be necessary for it to comply with its fiduciary duties to
     the Shareholders under applicable law to effect a Change in Recommendation
     and (y) (I) the Seller Board may approve or recommend to the Shareholders
     an Acquisition Proposal that the Seller Board has determined constitutes a
     Superior Proposal (a "Seller Subsequent Determination"), (II) terminate
     this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and (III) enter into any letter
     of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement
     related to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, in each case
     with respect to clause (y), Seller has fully complied with its obligations
     under this Section 6.01(c) and with the terms of Section 8.01(h), and has
     paid to Purchaser the Expenses and the Termination Fee, in each case, in
     accordance with Section 8.03.

                                       26
<PAGE>

          (d)      Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Seller
     from taking and disclosing to the Shareholders a position contemplated by
     Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
     required disclosure to the Shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of
     the Seller Board failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
     obligations under applicable law.

     Section 6.02  PROXY STATEMENT.

          (a)      As promptly as practical after the execution of this
     Agreement, Seller shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
     to be sent to the Shareholders in connection with the meeting of the
     Shareholders to vote upon this Agreement and the Merger (the "Seller
     Shareholders' Meeting"). Except as permitted by Section 6.01, Seller shall,
     through the Seller Board, include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation
     of the Seller Board that the Shareholders adopt this Agreement and shall
     use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such adoption. Purchaser and
     Seller shall make all other necessary filings with respect to the Merger
     under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

          (b)      Seller shall take such action as may be necessary to insure
     that the information supplied by Seller for inclusion in the Proxy
     Statement shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
     Shareholders, at the time of the Seller Shareholders' Meeting, and at the
     Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of
     the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with
     respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary
     in order to make the statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or
     misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
     statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
     proxies for the Seller Shareholders' Meeting which has become false or
     misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating
     to Seller or any of its affiliates, officers, or directors should be
     discovered by Seller which should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy
     Statement, Seller shall promptly so inform Purchaser.

          (c)      Purchaser shall take such action as may be necessary to
     insure that the information supplied by Purchaser for inclusion in the
     Proxy Statement shall not on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed
     to the Shareholders, at the time of the Seller Shareholders' Meeting, and
     at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in
     light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or
     misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material
     fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the Proxy Statement
     not false or misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
     correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
     solicitation of proxies for the Seller Shareholders' Meeting which has
     become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
     event relating to Purchaser or any of its affiliates, officers, or
     directors should be discovered by Purchaser which should be set forth in a
     supplement to the Proxy Statement, Purchaser shall promptly so inform
     Seller.

     Section 6.03  ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Upon reasonable notice, Seller shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, and other representatives of Purchaser, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
officers, employees, agents, customers and accountants of Seller and its
Subsidiaries and their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, and
records and, during such period, each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other
(a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement, and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties, and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Unless
otherwise required by law, the parties will hold any such information which is
nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the confidentiality agreement between
Purchaser and Seller, dated July 19, 2005 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No
information or Knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section
6.03 shall affect or be deemed to modify a representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.

     Section 6.04  SELLER SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. Seller shall, through the
Seller Board, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Seller
Shareholders' Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this
Agreement and obtaining approval of adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Seller
Common Stock entitled to vote thereon ("Shareholder Approval") as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Seller's obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.04 shall not be affected by (i) a Change in Recommendation permitted
by Section 6.01(c) or (ii) the commencement, public announcement, disclosure or
other communication to the Seller Board of any Acquisition Proposal or any
intention (whether or not conditional) with respect to any potential or future
Acquisition Proposal, unless, in the case of clause (i), this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(e), or, in the case of clause (ii), this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(h).

     Section 6.05  LEGAL CONDITIONS TO MERGER. Subject to Section 6.01, each of
Purchaser and Seller will use their reasonable best efforts to comply promptly
with all legal requirements which may be imposed on it with respect to the
Merger (which actions shall include, without limitation, furnishing all
information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or
filings with any other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and
furnish information to each other in connection with any such requirements
imposed upon either of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger. Each of Purchaser and Seller will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, order, or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity or other public third party, required to be obtained
or made by Purchaser, Seller, or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this
Agreement.

     Section 6.06  PAYMENT OF TAXES. Seller shall pay, prior to the Effective
Time (a) all Taxes required to be paid prior to the Effective Time, and (b)
shall withhold with respect to its employees all federal and state income taxes,
FICA, FUTA, and other Taxes required to be withheld.

     Section 6.07  PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Purchaser and Seller shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, or with respect to
anything involving or referring to the other, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by law.

as to itself, its Subsidiaries and its affiliates, that no agent, broker,
investment banker, financial advisor, or other firm or person is or will be
entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except
Stephens Inc., whose fees and expenses will be paid by Seller in accordance with
the terms of the Stephens Letter (a copy of which has been delivered by Seller
to Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement).

     Section 6.10  EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

          (a)      For a period of not less than one (1) year following the
     Effective Time, the Continuing Corporation shall provide all individuals
     who are employees of the Seller and its Subsidiaries (including employees
     who are not actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of
     absence) on the Effective Time (the "Affected Employees"), while employed
     by the Continuing Corporation, with compensation and benefits (not
     including equity compensation) which are substantially comparable in the
     aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such Affected
     Employee as of the date of this Agreement. The Continuing Corporation shall
     continue to provide and recognize all accrued but unused vacation of
     Affected Employees as of the Effective Time. Affected Employees shall be
     credited with service with the Seller or its Subsidiaries for all purposes
     under any of the welfare plans (including medical, dental and disability

     Effective Time. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Continuing Corporation
     to, assume and honor all Seller Material Contracts relating to employment
     to the extent of the respective terms of such agreements. Subject to the
     preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
     limiting the power of the Continuing Corporation or Purchaser to amend or
     terminate any particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
     policy or as requiring the Continuing Corporation or Purchaser to offer to
     continue the employment of any Affected Employee for any period of time or
     to offer to continue (other than as required by its written terms) any
     employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy. Notwithstanding
     anything in this Section 6.10 to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10
     is intended to, and shall not, confer upon any person other than the
     parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

     rules, statues and ordinances resulting from the Merger or from the actions
     of the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries following the

notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser will give prompt notice to Seller, of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure would
be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof
to the Effective Time, and (b) any material failure of Seller or Purchaser, or
any director, officer, employee, agent or representative thereof, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder.

     Section 6.12  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to the appropriate vote of shareholders of Seller
described in Section 6.04, including cooperating fully with the other party. In
case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Continuing
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities, and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such
necessary action.

     Section 6.13  DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY.

          (a)      From and after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
     indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who is on the date hereof,
     or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
     the Effective Time, an officer, director, employee or agent (the
     "Indemnified Party") of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries against all
     losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including
     attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in
     settlement in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim,
     proceeding or investigation (each, a "Claim") to the extent that any such
     Claim is based on or arises out of, (i) the fact that any person is or was
     a director, officer, employee or agent of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
     at any time prior to the Effective Time or is or was serving at the request
     of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or
     agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
     enterprise at any time prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) this Agreement
     or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in each case to
     the extent that any such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising,
     existing, or occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, regardless of
     whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
     Effective Time (the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii), the
     "Pre-Merger Matters"), to the fullest extent indemnified under Seller's
     Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or any indemnification agreements in
     effect as of the date hereof, or under the MBCA, including in each case
     provisions relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense
     of any action or suit.

                                       30
<PAGE>

          (b)      Purchaser agrees that all right to indemnification and all
     limitations or exculpation of liabilities existing in favor of any
     Indemnified Party as provided in Seller's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws
     or the MBCA as in effect as of the Effective Time shall continue in full
     force and effect with respect to Pre-Merger Matters, without any amendment
     thereto, for a period of six years from the Effective Time to the extent
     such rights are consistent with the MBCA, provided, that in the event any
     Claim or Claims with respect to any such Pre-Merger Matters are asserted or
     made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect
     of any such Claim or Claims shall continue until disposition of any such
     Claim or Claims; provided, however, that any determination required to be
     made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct complies with
     the standards set forth under the MBCA, Sellers' Articles of Incorporation
     or Bylaws, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel
     selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the
     Purchaser, retained at the Purchaser's expense; and provided further, that
     nothing in this Section shall impair any rights or obligations of any
     present or former directors or officers of Seller.

          (c)      Purchaser shall maintain in effect Seller's directors' and
     officers' liability insurance policy as of the Effective Time ("D&O
     Insurance") with respect to Pre-Merger Matters for a period of not less
     than six years after the Effective Time, provided, that Purchaser may
     substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts
     containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers.

          (d)      This Section 6.13 shall survive consummation of the Merger
     and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, an Indemnified Party or
     person covered by D&O Insurance or otherwise eligible for the benefits of
     this Section 6.13 and their heirs and personal representatives and will be
     binding on the Purchaser and the Continuing Corporation.

     Section 6.14  FINANCING. Purchaser and Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and shall
comply in all respects with their representations, warranties, covenants and
commitments contained therein; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser and Sub shall be entitled to
obtain, in their sole discretion, substitute debt financing in place of some or
all of the financing with one or more other nationally recognized financial
institutions if, and only if, the Commitment Letters or any substitute
commitment letters have not expired and such substitute debt financing would not
delay the consummation of the Merger beyond 180 days following the date of this
Agreement.

     Section 6.15  SECTION 16 MATTERS. Seller agrees to take, and cause the
Seller Board, or appropriate committee of the Seller Board, to take, prior to
the Effective Time, any and all such actions as may be reasonably necessary to
afford an exemption from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act for
any acquisitions and dispositions of equity securities of Seller by its
directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     certificate of Seller to such effect; provided, however, that claims,

of the following conditions, any of which may be waived, in writing, exclusively
by Seller.

     contemplated hereby; and Seller shall have received a certificate of
     Purchaser to such effect.

     consents, waivers, and appeals required under any of Purchaser's material
     agreements, contracts, and licenses where the failure to obtain such

     exchange offer;

          (f)      by Seller, if the Board of Directors of Purchaser shall have
     withdrawn or modified its approval of the Merger in a manner adverse to
     Seller or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

          (g)      by Purchaser or Seller, if there has been a material breach

     or, in the case of a covenant or agreement, within 20 business days
     following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
     from the other party (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement

     material breach of this Agreement);

          (h)      by Seller, if the Seller Board makes a Change in
     Recommendation or a Seller Subsequent Determination in accordance with the
     terms of Section 6.01(c) and Seller, prior to or concurrently with such
     termination, pays to Purchaser in immediately available funds the
     Termination Fee; or

          (i)      by Seller, if the Commitment Letters or such substitute
     commitment letters contemplated by Section 6.14 expire within 180 days
     following the date of this Agreement.

     Section 8.02  EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall immediately became
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser,
Seller, Sub or their respective officers, directors, shareholders, or
affiliates, except as set forth in Section 8.03; provided, however, that the
provisions of this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX (except Section
9.01) of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement.

     Section 8.03  FEES AND EXPENSES.

          (a)      Except as set forth in this Section 8.03, all fees and
     expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

     affiliates or on their respective behalf in connection with or related to
     the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
     this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively,
     "Expenses"), up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000, if this Agreement is
     terminated:

                   (i)      by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.01(e);

                   (ii)     by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.01(g) after a
          willful breach by Seller of this Agreement; provided that, Seller's
          breach of Section 6.01 shall be deemed willful for purposes of this
          Section 8.03(b)(ii);

                   (iii)    by Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(h); or

                   (i)      by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.01(e);

                   (ii)     by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.01(g) after a
          willful breach by Seller of any of its covenants set forth in this
          Agreement which breach gives rise to the failure of the condition set
          forth in Section 7.02(b) to be satisfied; provided that, Seller's
          breach of Section 6.01 shall be deemed willful for purposes of this
          Section 8.03(c)(ii); provided further, that, the Termination Fee shall
          be required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.03(c)(ii) if
          Purchaser has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g)
          after a willful breach by Seller of any of its covenants set forth in
          this Agreement other than the covenants set forth in Sections 6.01 and
          6.04 only if, (I) at the time of such termination, there shall have
          been announced an Acquisition Proposal which shall not have been
          absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned and (II) Seller
          shall have recommended a bona fide written offer by a Third Party
          that, if consummated, would result in such Third Party (or its
          shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the
          outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock (or of the surviving entity
          in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity
          in a merger) or all or substantially all of the total consolidated
          assets of Seller, or signed a letter of intent, agreement in
          principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement for, or
          consummated, such a transaction, within six (6) months after such
          termination;

                   (iii)    by Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(h); or

                   (iv)     by Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or Section
          8.01(d) if, (I) at the time of such termination, there shall have been
          announced an Acquisition Proposal which shall not have been absolutely
          and unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned and (II) Seller shall have
          recommended a bona fide written offer by a Third Party that, if
          consummated, would result in such Third Party (or its shareholders)
          owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding
          shares of Seller Common Stock (or of the surviving entity in a merger
          or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger)
          or all or substantially all of the total consolidated assets of
          Seller, or signed a letter of intent, agreement in principle,
          acquisition agreement or other agreement for, or consummated, such a
          transaction, within six (6) months after such termination.

          (d)      The expenses and fees, if applicable, payable pursuant to
     this Article VIII shall be paid within two (2) business days after the
     event giving rise to the obligation to pay such amount and shall constitute
     liquidated damages once paid in full.

          (e)      Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
     Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement and that, without these agreements, Purchaser would not enter
     into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay any
     amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03 and, in order to obtain such
     payment, Purchaser commences a suit which results in a judgment against
     Seller for the amount set forth in this Section 8.03, Seller shall pay to
     Purchaser its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
     attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

          (f)      As used in this Agreement:

                   (i)      "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal
          or offer, including a public pronouncement by any Third Party that it
          is considering making an inquiry, proposal or offer, (A) for a
          transaction pursuant to which any Third Party would acquire more than
          20% of the outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to a
          tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (B) for a merger or other
          business combination involving Seller pursuant to which any Third
          Party would acquire more than 20% of the outstanding equity securities
          of Seller or the entity surviving such merger or business combination,
          (C) for any other transaction pursuant to which any Third Party would
          acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
          equity securities of Subsidiaries of Seller, and the entity surviving
          any merger or business combination including any of them) of Seller
          having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of
          Purchaser in good faith) equal to more than 20% of the fair market
          value of all the assets of Seller, and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
          whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (D) any public
          announcement of a proposal, plan, or intention to do any of the
          foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

                   (ii)     "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written
          offer made by a Third Party that, if consummated, would result in such
          Third Party (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more

          surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the
          surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the total
          consolidated assets of Seller (A) on terms which the Special Committee
          has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with its
          outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
          reputation, to be more favorable to the Shareholders (in their
          capacities as shareholders) from a financial point of view than the
          Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) if the
          consideration offered is wholly or partially in cash, the financing
          therefor is firmly committed, and (C) which is reasonably capable of
          being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all legal,
          regulatory, fiduciary and other aspects of the proposal, including the
          likelihood that such transaction will be consummated.

     Section 8.04  AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with
