issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.7(c)), and all rights in
respect thereof, shall at the Effective Time be canceled and automatically
converted into and become the right to receive one Tech Ordinary Share (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ") from Tech or Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger,
at the Effective Time, each holder of a Salix Certificate and each holder of
a Salix Book Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Salix Common Stock represented by such Salix Certificate or Salix
Book Entry Share (as applicable) to be issued, without interest, in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Salix Certificate or exchange of
such Salix Book Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.8(b) (or, in the
case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Salix Certificate, Section 2.8(h).

(b) _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any of their
respective shareholders, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all rights in
respect thereof, shall forthwith be canceled and cease to exist and be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and which shall be held by
IrSub3.

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share, if
any, of Salix Common Stock and preferred stock that is held by Salix as a
treasury share immediately prior to the Effective Time shall forthwith be
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no distribution shall be
made with respect thereto.

(d) _Ownership_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Cosmo will own a
number of Tech Ordinary Shares such that Cosmo will own no less than 20.1% of
Tech stock (by vote and value) for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code.

 



21 Section 2.8 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Tech and Merger Sub shall
engage Computershare or another institution satisfactory to Salix (acting in
its sole and absolute discretion) to act as exchange agent in connection with
the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Tech
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Salix Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time, on behalf of, and as solely directed by, Merger Sub (if not otherwise
directly delivered by Merger Sub itself) certificates (if applicable)
representing the Tech Ordinary Shares to be delivered to holders of Salix
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7(a) (or appropriate alternative
arrangements satisfactory to Salix (acting in its sole and absolute
discretion) shall be made by Tech if uncertificated Tech Ordinary Shares will
be issued). All certificates representing Tech Ordinary Shares deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Salix Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
Effective Time, Tech shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Salix Common Stock (the "
_Salix Certificates_ "), which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and that risk of loss and title to the Salix Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Salix Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall
be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Tech and Salix) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Salix Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Salix Certificates
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Salix Certificates shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor that number of Tech Ordinary Shares (after
taking into account all Salix Certificates surrendered by such holder) to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 (which may be in
uncertificated form), and the Salix Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Salix Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Salix,
the proper number of Tech Ordinary Shares in form may be transferred to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Salix Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Salix Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such transfer shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of Tech Ordinary Shares to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Salix Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Tech
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.8(b)(i), each Salix Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.8(c).

 



22 (ii) _Salix Book Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Salix Book Entry Shares
shall not be required to deliver a Salix Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof,
each holder of record of one or more Salix Book Entry Shares whose shares of
Salix Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7 shall automatically upon the Effective
Time (or, at any later time at which such Salix Book Entry Shares shall be so
converted) be entitled to receive, and Tech shall cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the number of
Tech Ordinary Shares (after taking into account all Salix Book Entry Shares
such holder has the right to receive) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7 (which shall be in uncertificated form) and the
Salix Book Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to
Section 2.8(c).

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Salix Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Tech Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Salix Certificate with respect to the
Tech Ordinary Shares represented thereby until such Salix Certificate has been
surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.8. Subject to applicable Law
and the provisions of this Section 2.8, following surrender of any such Salix
Certificate, there shall be transferred or paid to the recordholder thereof by
the Exchange Agent, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
number of Tech Ordinary Shares transferrable in exchange therefor pursuant to
this Section 2.8 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole Tech Ordinary Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such Tech Ordinary Shares.

(ii) _Salix Book Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law and the provisions
of this Section 2.8, there shall be transferred or paid to the holder of Tech
Ordinary Shares issued in exchange for Salix Book Entry Shares, without
interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Tech Ordinary Shares by the
Exchange Agent, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Tech
Ordinary Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date subsequent to the time of such delivery by the Exchange
Agent to such Tech Ordinary Shares.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Salix Common Stock_. All Tech Ordinary
Shares transferred upon the surrender for exchange of Salix Certificates or,
immediately, in the case of Salix Book Entry Shares, in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been transferred in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Salix Common
Stock previously represented by such Salix Certificates or Salix Book Entry
Shares (as applicable). After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Salix shall be closed, and there shall be no

 



23  further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Salix Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Salix Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which has
not been transferred to the holders of Salix Certificates or Salix Book Entry
Shares (as applicable) as of the one year anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Tech or its designee, upon demand, and the Tech Ordinary
Shares included therein shall be sold at the best price reasonably obtainable
at that time. Any holder of Salix Certificates or Salix Book Entry Shares (as
applicable) who has not complied with this _Article II_ prior to the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to Tech
for payment of such holders claim for the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Tech Ordinary Shares as
contemplated by Section 2.8(c) (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar applicable Laws).

(f) _No Liability_. None of any Tech Group Entity, Salix, any Cosmo Entity or
the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Tech Ordinary
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Tech Group Entities and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Salix Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Tech or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Tech or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have
been paid.

(h)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Salix
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Salix Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Tech
Ordinary Shares as may be required pursuant to Section 2.7(a) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(c); provided, that
Tech may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Salix
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Tech, or a bond in such sum as Tech may reasonably direct as
indemnity, against any claim that may be made against Tech or the Exchange
Agent in respect of the Salix Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

 

Section 2.9 _Salix Stock Based Awards and Equity Plans_. (a) Each Salix
Compensatory Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Salix Compensatory Option, the number of Tech

 



24  Ordinary Shares equal to the number of shares of Salix Common Stock subject
to such Salix Compensatory Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, at
an exercise price per Tech Ordinary Share equal to the exercise price per
share of Salix Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Salix
Compensatory Option.

(b) Each Salix Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into a right to
receive, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Salix Stock Award, the number of Tech Ordinary Shares equal to the
number of shares of Salix Common Stock subject to such Salix Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, Tech will assume the Salix Equity Plans and be
able to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Laws and
NASDAQ regulations, under the terms of the Salix Equity Plans to issue the
previously reserved but unissued shares of Salix Common Stock (including
shares subject to the unexercised or unissued portions of any Salix
Compensatory Option or Salix Stock Award that expire, terminate or are
canceled and shares subject to any Salix Compensatory Option or Salix Stock
Award that are reacquired pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which
such shares were issued that return to the Salix Equity Plans pursuant to
their terms), except that (i) shares of Salix Common Stock covered by such
awards will be issued as Tech Ordinary Shares and (ii) all references to a
number of shares of Salix Common Stock will be changed to reference Tech
Ordinary Shares.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Salix
(or, if applicable, any committee administering Salixs stock-based incentive
plans) and Tech shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as
may be reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.9.

Section 2.10 _Deliveries by Cosmo and the Continuing Affiliates_. At the
Closing, Cosmo shall, or shall cause one or more of the Continuing Affiliates
to, as the case may be, deliver the following to Salix or any Person
designated by Salix:

during regular business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, and in a
manner as shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
the Cosmo Parties, to the offices, plants, properties, Books and Records and
employees of the Tech Group Entities and, to the extent related to the
Business and the Reorganization, the Cosmo Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives, and (ii) furnish to Salix and its respective
accountants, counsel and other Representatives all such information and data
concerning the Business and the Reorganization as Salix or its respective
Representatives may reasonably request (except to the extent that such
information is subject to attorney-client privilege), in each case, subject to
any applicable Laws, in order that Salix may make reasonable investigations
of the affairs of the Business, the Tech Group Entities and the
Reorganization.

 



46 (b) From the date hereof through the Closing, Salix shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to Cosmo and Cosmos accountants, counsel and
other Representatives reasonable access during regular business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, and in a manner as shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of Salix, to the offices, plants, properties,
Books and Records and employees of Salix and its Subsidiaries, and their
respective Representatives, and (ii) furnish to Cosmo and its accountants,
counsel and other Representatives all such information and data as Cosmo or
such Representatives may reasonably request (except to the extent that such
information is subject to attorney-client privilege), in each case, subject to
any applicable Laws, in order that Cosmo may make reasonable investigations
of the affairs of Salix and its Subsidiaries.

(c) From the date hereof until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, Cosmo shall, and shall cause the Continuing Affiliates and each of their
Representatives to, treat as confidential and shall safeguard any and all
information, know-how, knowledge and data (other than historical
financial reporting information) relating to the Business (the " _Acquired
Confidential Information_ "), in each case in their respective possession by
using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable standard of care,
to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such
information, know-how, knowledge and data as Cosmo and its Affiliates used
with respect thereto prior to the date hereof. From the Closing Date until the
seventh (7th) anniversary thereof, Tech and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause each of their Representatives to, treat as confidential and shall
safeguard any and all information, know-how, knowledge and data (other than
historical financial reporting information) relating to Cosmos business
(other than the Business) (the " _Retained Confidential Information_ ") in
their respective possession by using the same degree of care, but not less
than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use,
dissemination or disclosure of such information, know-how, knowledge and data
as Tech uses with respect to the Acquired Confidential Information. Prior to
the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parties agree that each
of them and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives may only
disclose, in the case of Cosmo and its Affiliates, Acquired Confidential
Information or, in the case of Tech and its Affiliates, Retained Confidential
Information, as the case may be, (i) to the extent counsel to such Person
advises that disclosure is required to comply with Law ( _provided_ that such
Party shall provide prior written notice to Cosmo or Tech, as applicable, of
such disclosure, unless prohibited by Law, as promptly as practical and shall
seek to limit any such disclosure and to protect from public disclosure by way
of a protective order or otherwise, in each case, to the extent permitted by
Law), and (ii) to its Representatives who reasonably need to know such
information for purposes of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
Reorganization Agreements ( _provided_ that each Party shall instruct any such
Representative to keep such information confidential in accordance with this
Agreement). In no event shall Cosmo use, or permit any other Person to use,
the Acquired Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly
contemplated under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the Reorganization Agreements. In no event shall Tech use, or permit any
other Person to use, the Retained Confidential Information for any purpose
other than as expressly contemplated under this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the Reorganization Agreements. The Parties acknowledge that the
confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 5.1(c) shall not extend
to information, knowledge and data that (i) is or becomes publicly available
through no act or omission of a Party owing a confidentiality obligation
imposed by this Section 5.1(c) in respect of such information, knowledge and
data (a " _Receiving Party_ "), (ii) is or becomes available to a Receiving
Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Party to which
such information, knowledge and data relates; _provided_ , that the source of
such information, knowledge and data was not known to the

 



47  Receiving Party to be bound by confidentiality obligations to the Party to
which such information, knowledge and data relates, or (iii) the Receiving
Party can establish that it independently developed such information,
knowledge and data without reference to information, knowledge and data
provided to such Receiving Party in connection with the Transactions
contemplated hereby and, in the case of Cosmo, its Continuing Affiliates and
each of their Representatives, without reference to any Acquired Confidential
Information.

(d) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in Section 5.1(c), Cosmo may
disclose such information as is required by applicable Law to a third party
purchaser of any or all Tech Ordinary Shares held by Cosmo or any Continuing
Affiliate in a privately negotiated transaction to the extent permitted by
and pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii) and (iii) of the Shareholders Agreement;
provided, that it shall be a condition to any such disclosure that such third
party purchaser shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the
Surviving Corporation in respect of any such information on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and in any
event, containing restrictions on the disclosure and use of any such
information no less restrictive than those contained herein.

(e) No review or investigation by any Party or its Representatives pursuant
to this Section 5.1 or otherwise, shall affect or be deemed to modify or
qualify any representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement.

(f) Following the Closing until the seventh (7th) anniversary thereof, Cosmo
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) retain those Books and
Records that relate in part to the Business but which do not relate primarily
to the Business and (ii) afford to Tech and Techs accountants, counsel and
other Representatives reasonable access to inspect and copy during regular
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, any such Books and Records
retained by Cosmo or any of its Subsidiaries, to the portion of such Books and
Records as are related to the operations of the Business. After the seventh
(7th) anniversary of the Closing, Cosmo shall give Tech at least twenty (20)
Business Days notice of any intention to discard or destroy such Books and
Records so that Tech may elect, at its own expense, to take possession of or
otherwise copy any or all such Books and Records.

Section 5.2 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall use (and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries, officers and directors, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Affiliates, attorneys, accountants and Representatives,
to use) their respective reasonable best efforts as soon as practicable to

things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law, this
Agreement, the Reorganization Agreements and the Ancillary Agreements to
consummate and make effective the Merger, the Reorganization, the

advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or any other Person
in order to consummate the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization
Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated

determination that would, in whole or in part, restrain, prevent or delay the
consummation of the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements,
the Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;  _provided_ , that neither Salix nor the Cosmo Parties shall be
required to offer, take or accept any operational restriction or any hold
separate order, sale, divestiture or disposition of any plants, assets or
businesses (of such Parties or the Business) and the Cosmo Parties shall not
do any of the foregoing, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business,
without the consent of Salix (acting in its sole and absolute discretion). For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.2(a) shall require any of
the Parties to defend any litigation or regulatory proceeding against the
parties challenging the Transaction; however, if Salix chooses, in its sole
and absolute discretion, to defend any litigation or regulatory proceeding
challenging the Transaction, this Section 5.2(a) shall require the Cosmo
Parties to reasonably cooperate and provide reasonable assistance in defending
against such litigation; _provided_ that, such cooperation and assistance
shall be provided by the Cosmo Parties at Salixs expense, so any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Cosmo Parties in defense of such
litigation shall be promptly reimbursed by Salix.

 

(b) Each of the Parties shall cooperate regarding, and keep the other Parties
reasonably apprised of the status of, matters relating to the completion of
the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements, the Ancillary
Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and work
cooperatively in connection (i) with obtaining all necessary
notices, reports, applications, filings and other submissions, and to obtain
as promptly as is practicable all consents, approvals, waivers, licenses,
permits, authorizations, registrations, qualifications, decisions,
determinations or other permissions or actions of any Governmental Authority
and (ii) all other communications with any Governmental Authority (which for
purposes of this Section 5.2 includes staff of Governmental Authorities and

to the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements, the
Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In that regard, each Party shall: (A) promptly notify the
other Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the others orally of), any
communications from or with any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements, the Ancillary
Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (B)
permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the others in connection with, any proposed written
(or any proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements, the
Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (C) not participate in any meeting or oral communication with
any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, the
Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and

the other Parties in advance

 



49  and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; (D) furnish the
other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof, including summaries of any

with respect to the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization Agreements,
the Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (E) furnish the other Parties with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the others may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such Governmental Authority. Each Party may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material

only." Such competitively sensitive material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings provided in this
Section 5.2, the Parties hereto agree to take or cause to be taken the
following actions: (i) the prompt provision to any and all federal,
supranational, state, local or non-U.S. Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust Laws ("
_Governmental Antitrust Authority_ ") of information and documents requested
by any Governmental Antitrust Authority or necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the Merger, the Reorganization, the
Reorganization Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and any other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, in any event, the Parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to make all filings with such
Governmental Antitrust Authorities (including all filings required under the
HSR Act, with the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") or the U.S. Department
of Justice (" _DOJ_ ")) within ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof

Authorities, within ten (10) Business Days following the identification by a
Party that such filing is so required), (ii) the prompt provision to the FTC

investigation, inquiry, action or proceeding that would make consummation, in
whole or in part, of the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization
Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay, in whole or in
part, consummation of the Merger, the Reorganization, the Reorganization
Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements and any other Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any and all steps prior to the Salix Outside Date necessary
to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction, decree, order, judgment,

shall, to the extent requested to do so, provide copies of the relevant
portions thereof to Tech.

taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of Tax.

Parties to perform their obligations to effect the Reorganization in
accordance with _Schedule A_ ), including any legal and accounting fees and
expenses attributable to any such Taxes.

 



66 (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.4, payment in full of any amount
due to the Salix Tax Indemnitees or the Cosmo Tax Indemnitors, as applicable,
under this Section 7.2 shall be made to the affected Salix Tax Indemnitee or

Days before the date payment of the Taxes to which such payment relates is
due.

(d) Neither the Salix Tax Indemnitees nor Cosmo shall be entitled to assert
any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.2 after the end of the
applicable survival period as specified in Section 7.11; _provided_ , that, if
on or prior to the last date of such survival period, Salix or Cosmo,
as applicable, shall have provided Cosmo or Salix, as applicable, with
written notice of a claim for indemnification under this Section 7.2, then the
Salix Tax Indemnitees and Cosmo shall continue to have the right to be
indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such claim has
been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this _Article VII_.

 

Section 7.3 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For purposes of this _Article VII_
, in order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle
Period, the Parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted or required under
applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or
period for all purposes of the Tech Group Entities (other than the Surviving
Corporation). In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of any of the
Tech Group Entities (other than the Surviving Corporation), or with respect to
the Business, that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, except
as otherwise provided in this Section 7.3 and to the extent permitted or
required under applicable Law, the portion of such Taxes that are allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be (x) in the case of Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis, franchise Taxes based on capitalization, debt or shares
of stock authorized, issued or outstanding and ad valorem Taxes, the amount of
such Taxes for the entire taxable period, multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such taxable period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
entire number of calendar days in such taxable period, and the balance of such
Taxes shall be attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , that
if any property, asset or other right of any of the Tech Group Entities (other
than the Surviving Corporation), or the Business, is sold, disposed of or
deemed disposed of or otherwise transferred or realized for any Tax purpose
on or prior to the Closing Date, then ad valorem, capital gains, transfer or
other Taxes pertaining to such property, asset or other right shall be
attributed entirely to the Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (y) in the case of
Taxes not described in (x) the amount that would be payable on the basis of an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date, in each case,
only to the extent that it is consistent with the allocation of Taxes
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b).

Section 7.4 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. (a) Cosmo shall file or
cause to be filed (i) any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that
includes Cosmo, any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Cosmo that directly or
indirectly holds an equity interest in Tech or any Continuing Affiliate and
(ii) any other Tax Return of Tech for any taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and
complete in all material respects and accurately set forth all items to the
extent required to be reflected or included in such Tax Returns by applicable
Law. All such Tax Returns shall be timely filed in a manner consistent with
past practice, shall not include any change in any method of accounting
(unless required by Law) and shall not include any Tax election that is
inconsistent with past practice. Cosmo shall, reasonably promptly after the
filing of a Tax Return described in clause (i) or (ii) above, provide Tech a
copy of such Tax Return (or a copy of a pro forma separate Tax Return in the
case of a Tax Return described in clause (i)). Cosmo shall remit or cause to
be remitted to the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes shown by such Tax
Returns to be due.

 



67 (b) Except to the extent set forth in Section 7.4(a), Tech shall file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns of, or that include, any of the Tech Group
Entities.

(c) With respect to any Tax Return of any of the Tech Group Entities (other
than the Surviving Corporation) for a Straddle Period (such Tax Return, a "
_Straddle Period Return_ "), Tech shall deliver a copy of such Straddle Period
Return to Cosmo at least forty (40) calendar days prior to the due date
(giving effect to any extension thereof), accompanied by an allocation between
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period of the Taxes shown
to be due on such Straddle Period Return. Such Straddle Period Return and
allocation shall not be filed or become final without prior written consent
of Cosmo (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of receipt by Cosmo
of such Straddle Period Return and allocation, Cosmo may deliver to Tech a
written request for changes to such Straddle Period Return or allocation. If
Cosmo does not deliver such a request within such period, the Straddle Period
Return and allocation shall be final and binding. If Cosmo delivers such a
request, then Tech and Cosmo shall undertake in good faith to resolve the
issues raised in such request within the following ten (10) calendar day
period. If Tech and Cosmo are unable to resolve all issues described in such
request within such ten (10) calendar day period, the disputed issues shall be
presented to the Tax Accounting Referee on the next Business Day to resolve
all disputed issues at least five (5) calendar days prior to the due date of
such Straddle Period Return (giving effect to any extension thereof);
_provided_ that the Tax Accounting Referees review shall be limited to the
issues submitted by the Parties. Each of Cosmo and Tech shall bear and pay
one half of the fees and other costs charged by the Tax Accounting Referee.
The determination of the Tax Accounting Referee shall be final and binding on
the Parties hereto.

 

(d) In the case of each Straddle Period Return, not later than two (2)
Business Days before the due date (including any extension thereof) for
payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return, Cosmo shall pay
or cause to be paid to the relevant Tech Group Entity the portion of the Taxes
in connection with such Straddle Period Return for which Cosmo is responsible
pursuant to Section 7.2 and Section 7.3.

Section 7.5 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) _Notices_. If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the Party
hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim shall promptly provide
written notice thereof to the other Party or Parties; _provided_ , that the
failure of such Party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other
Party of any of its obligations under this Section 7.5, except to the
extent that the other Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority.

 



68 (b) Cosmo shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any audit,
examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any Taxing
Authority in respect of a Tech Group Entity (other than the Surviving
Corporation) (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") for any taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date and relates to any matter that is indemnifiable
pursuant to Section 7.2(a), or for a Straddle Period and relates to any matter
that is indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a); _provided_ , that Cosmo
shall provide Tech with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each
stage of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , further, that Cosmo shall consult
with Tech regarding any such Tax Proceeding which relate solely to matters
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a) and shall allow Tech to participate
in any such proceeding (at its own cost and expense) and that Cosmo shall
conduct such Tax Proceedings in a reasonable manner and shall indemnify Tech
and its Subsidiaries, including the Tech Group Entities, from and against any
interest, penalties, surcharges or additional Taxes arising as a result of
such Tax Proceeding, to the extent such interest, penalties, surcharges and
additional Taxes are not already paid pursuant to the indemnities contained
in Section 7.2(a); _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to a Tax
Proceeding that includes matters that are not indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 7.2(a), Cosmo shall have the right to control only those aspects of
the Tax Proceeding related to such matters that are indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 7.2(a); _provided_ , _further_ , that no Tech Group Entity and any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any director or officer of any of the
foregoing shall be required to sign any document or make any assertion or
representation that is not true and correct and in accordance with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that no settlement or other disposition of any
claim for Tax which would adversely and materially affect the Tech Group
Entities or any of their Subsidiaries in any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be
agreed to without Techs prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) Subject to Section 7.5(d), Tech shall have the right to control the
conduct of any other Tax Proceeding and any other audit, examination,
contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any Taxing Authority in
respect of the Surviving Corporation in its sole discretion with respect to
any other Tax matter not covered in Section 7.5(b).

 

(d) _Straddle Periods_. Cosmo and Tech shall jointly control any Tax
Proceeding for a Straddle Period that is not governed by Section 7.5(b) and
shall employ counsel of their mutual choice and cooperate with the other and

any such Tax Proceeding. Cosmo and Tech shall mutually agree on any
settlement or other disposition of the Tax Proceeding. In the event Cosmo and
Tech are unable to agree regarding any aspect of the conduct of any such Tax
Proceeding, the decision shall be made by the counsel employed to pursue such
Tax Proceeding on the basis of counsels good faith judgment regarding the
course of action that would produce the overall lowest present value of Tax
and litigation cost to Cosmo and Tech. Any such Tax Proceeding expenses shall
be borne by Cosmo and Tech in the same proportion as such related Taxes are
borne by Cosmo and Tech in accordance with Section 7.3.

Section 7.6  _Cooperation_. Each Party hereto shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, provide to each of the other Parties hereto

(ii) determining a Liability for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this
_Article VII_ or a right to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting any Tax

of the Tech Group Entities (other than the Surviving Corporation) for their
respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date until the later
of (x) the expiration of the statute of limitations for the Tax periods to

and shall not cause or permit any of the Tech Group Entities (other than the
Surviving Corporation) to make or change any Tax election or amend any Tax

such action would not give rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.2(b).

(other than Section 7.5(c) relating to Straddle Period Returns) and not

against any and all Covered Losses suffered by such Salix Indemnified Parties
resulting from or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations or warranties of Cosmo in this Agreement (other than those

_Article VII_ ), or by Cosmo or any Continuing Affiliate in the
Ancillary Agreements or the Reorganization Agreements, in each case when

covenants or agreements made by the Cosmo Parties herein or by Cosmo or any

76 (b) The Salix Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section 9.2(a) after the date on
which such representation and warranty ceases to survive; _provided_ , that if
on or prior to the date such representation ceases to survive, a Notice of
Claim shall have been given to Cosmo pursuant to Section 9.4 for such
indemnification, the Salix Indemnified Parties shall continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
provided in this _Article IX_.

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Salix_. (a) Subject to Section 9.5(b) hereof,
from and after the Closing Date, the Tech Group Entities, including Salix as
the Surviving Corporation, shall indemnify and hold harmless Cosmo and the

(collectively, the " _Cosmo Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Covered Losses suffered by such Cosmo Indemnified Parties resulting from
or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations or warranties of Salix in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, in each case, when made, and, except for representations
and warranties that speak as of a specific date or time (which need only be
true and correct as of such date and time), on and as of the Closing Date,
(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenants or agreements made by Salix
herein or, solely in respect of covenants or agreements to be performed after
the Closing, by the Surviving Corporation, the Tech Group Entities or Salix
in this Agreement or in the Ancillary Agreements other than any Liability for
which any of the Cosmo Parties have indemnified the Salix Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 9.2, and (iii) any Action brought by a Governmental
Authority alleging a breach of applicable Law by a Cosmo Indemnified Party in
connection with the Structural Reorganization.

 

(b) The Cosmo Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section 9.3(a) after the date on
which such representation and warranty ceases to survive; _provided_ , that if
on or prior to the date such representation ceases to survive, a Notice of
Claim shall have been given to Salix pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof for such
indemnification, the Cosmo Indemnified Parties shall continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided
in this  _Article IX_.

Section 9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) Upon obtaining Knowledge of any
claim or demand which has given rise to, or is expected to give rise to, a
claim for indemnification hereunder, Salix or Cosmo, as the case may be, shall
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days) give written
notice (" _Notice of Claim_ ") of such claim or demand to the other. The
party giving such Notice of Claim shall furnish to the other party in
reasonable detail such information as the Salix Indemnified Parties or the
Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, may have with respect to such
indemnification claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served on it and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same). Subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 9.2(b) and Section 9.3(b), no failure
or delay by Tech or Cosmo in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or
otherwise affect the

 



77  obligation of Cosmo or Salix, respectively, to indemnify and hold the Salix
Indemnified Parties or the Cosmo Indemnified Parties, respectively, harmless,
except to the extent that such failure or delay shall have actually adversely
affected the ability of Salix or Cosmo, as the case may be, to defend against
or satisfy any Covered Losses for which the party seeking indemnification is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(b) If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given pursuant to
Section 9.4(a) hereof is a claim or demand asserted by a third party, the
party receiving such Notice of Claim shall have fifteen (15) calendar days
after the date on which Notice of Claim is given to notify the party giving
such Notice of Claim, in writing, of its election to defend such third
party claim or demand on behalf of the party seeking indemnification. If the
party receiving such Notice of Claim elects, on behalf of Salix or Cosmo, as
the case may be, to defend such third party claim or demand, the party seeking
indemnification shall make available to the indemnifying party and its
Representatives all records and other materials which are reasonably required
in the defense of such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise
cooperate with, and assist the indemnifying party in the defense of, such
third party claim or demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Salix
Indemnified Parties or the Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be,
shall not be required to provide copies of information to the indemnifying
party, to the extent that providing such information would cause such
information to not be protected by any legal privilege after taking into
account any joint defense or common interest agreement the parties have
entered into. So long as Cosmo or Salix, as the case may be, is defending
such third party claim in good faith, the Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall not pay, settle or compromise such
third party claim or demand. In such case, Cosmo or Salix, as the case may
be, may pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand (i) with
the written consent of Salix or Cosmo, on behalf of the Salix Indemnified
Parties or the Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, or (ii) without
such consent, so long as such settlement includes (A) an unconditional release
of the Salix Indemnified Parties or the Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case
may be, from all Liability in respect of such claim or litigation, (B) does
not subject the indemnified parties to any injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. If
the party receiving such Notice of Claim elects to defend such third party
claim or demand, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes
of this Agreement that the claims described in such Notice of Claim are within
the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder and (ii) the Salix
Indemnified Parties or the Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be,
shall have the right to participate in the defense of such third party claim
or demand, at such indemnified partys own expense. In the event, however,
that such indemnified party reasonably determines that representation by
counsel to the indemnifying parties of both such indemnifying parties and the
indemnified party could reasonably be expected to present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, then the indemnified party may employ separate counsel
to represent or defend it in any such action or proceeding and the
indemnifying parties will pay the fees and expenses of such counsel; 
_provided_ , that Cosmo or Salix, as the case may be, shall not, in connection
with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable
for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in
addition to reasonably necessary local counsel) at any time for all Salix
Indemnified Parties or Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be. If the
party receiving such Notice of Claim does not elect to defend such third party
claim or demand or does not defend such third party claim or demand in good
faith, the Salix Indemnified

 



78  Parties or Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall have the
right, in addition to any other right or remedy they may have hereunder, at
the expense of Cosmo or Salix, as the case may be, to defend such third party
claim or demand; _provided_ , that (i) such Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall not have any obligation to
participate in the defense of, or defend, any such third party claim or
demand; (ii) such Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as
the case may be, defense of or participation in the defense of any such third
party claim or demand shall not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations
of Cosmo or Salix, as applicable, under the agreements of indemnification set
forth in this _Article IX_ ; and (iii) such Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, may not settle any claim without the
consent of Cosmo or Salix, respectively (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) With respect to any third party claim subject to indemnification under
this _Article IX_ with respect to which the party receiving such Notice of
Claim has elected to defend such third party claim or demand in accordance
with the terms hereof, (i) both the party receiving such Notice of Claim and
the Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may
be, shall keep the other Persons reasonably informed of the status of such
third party claim and any related Actions at all stages thereof where such
Person is not represented by its own counsel, (ii) the Parties agree to render
to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and
to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of any third party claim; _provided_ , that (x) the party
receiving such Notice of Claim shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and
disbursements) by the Party providing such cooperation but shall not be
required to compensate such Party for time spent by its officers, directors,
employees or agents in such cooperation, and (iii) Salix or Cosmo,
as applicable, shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the
defense of such action with counsel of reputable standing reasonably
satisfactory to Cosmo or Salix, as the case may be, solely at its own expense
by notifying in writing the party to whom such Notice of Claim was delivered;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in any event, (x) the indemnifying party
defending such claim may require as a condition to such participation that
Salix or Cosmo, as the case may be, sign a confidentiality agreement, a joint
defense agreement or other similar documents reasonably requested, and (y) the
Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo Indemnified Parties and Cosmo or Salix, as
the case may be, shall enter into a joint defense agreement, common interest
agreement or similar agreement or arrangement if required in order to permit
the indemnifying party defending such claim to share material information with
the Salix Indemnified Parties or Cosmo Indemnified Parties, as the case may
be, and if entering into such agreement or arrangement would effectively
preclude any detrimental effect to any legal privilege that may attach to such
information, as reasonably determined by the indemnifying party defending such
claim upon consultation with outside legal counsel.

(d) Except for third party claims being defended in good faith, (i) Cosmo
shall satisfy its obligations under this _Article IX_ in respect of a valid
claim for indemnification hereunder which is not contested by Cosmo in good
faith in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which
Notice of Claim is given and (ii) Salix shall satisfy its obligations under
this _Article IX_ in respect of a valid claim for indemnification hereunder
which is not contested by Salix in good faith in writing within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date on which Notice of Claim is given.

 



79 Section 9.5 _Limitations; Additional Procedures_.

 

(a) Cosmo shall have no Liability for indemnification pursuant to clause (i)
of Section 9.2(a) with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder, (i) that are De Minimis Damages, or (ii) unless the
aggregate of all Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages) exceeds
$5,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case Cosmo shall be liable for all
such Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages), including the amount of
the Threshold. In no event shall Cosmos and the Continuing Affiliates
aggregate liability for Covered Losses under Section 9.2(a)(i) arising out of
any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Cosmos representations or warranties
under this Agreement (other than in respect of breaches of any Cosmo
Fundamental Representation) exceed $500,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

(b) Salix shall have no Liability for indemnification pursuant to clause (i)
of Section 9.3(a) with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder, (i) that are De Minimis Damages or (ii) unless the
aggregate of all Covered Losses (other than De Minimis Damages) exceeds the
Threshold, in which case Salix shall be liable for all such Covered Losses
(other than De Minimis Damages), including the amount of the Threshold. In no
event shall Salixs aggregate liability for Covered Losses under Section
9.3(a)(i) arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Salixs
representations or warranties under this Agreement (other than in respect of
breaches of any Salix Fundamental Representation) exceed the Cap.

 

(c) For purposes of determining the existence and amount of any indemnity
obligation under this _Article IX_ with respect to any breach of any covenant
or obligation, or any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
any express qualifications or limitations set forth in such covenant or
obligation, or representation or warranty, as to materiality, material adverse
effect, "Business Material Adverse Effect" or "Salix Material Adverse Effect"
(or other similar materiality qualifiers) contained therein, shall be
disregarded.

 

(d) The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge actually acquired at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Cosmo Indemnified
Person or Salix Indemnified Person shall be entitled to any indemnification or
reimbursement under any provisions of this Agreement for any amount to the
extent such Person or its Affiliates has been indemnified or reimbursed for
such amount under any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or under any insurance policy.

 



80 (f) Except in the case of fraud, from and after the Closing, the exclusive
remedy for any Cosmo Indemnified Person or Salix Indemnified Person for
Covered Losses or other monetary damages arising from a breach of this
Agreement or otherwise relating to the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except as otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement) shall be
the indemnification provided under this _Article IX_ or _Article VII_. There
shall be no remedy at law or otherwise for De Minimis Damages arising out of
the events or circumstances described in clause (i) of Sections 9.2(a) or
9.3(a). Nothing in this Agreement shall interfere with or impede a partys
right to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive
relief) to enforce any covenant in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

(g) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT
SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR (B) ANY LOST
PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES; _provided_ , _however_
, that if a Cosmo Indemnified Person or Salix Indemnified Person is held
liable to a third party based on any final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction for any such Covered Losses and the applicable indemnifying party
is obligated to indemnify such Person for the matter that gave rise to such
Covered Losses, then such indemnifying party shall be liable for, and
obligated to reimburse such Cosmo Indemnified Person or Salix Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, for such Covered Losses.

 

Section 9.6 _Exclusive Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article IX_ , the above provisions of this _Article IX_
shall not apply to Tax indemnification matters, which matters shall instead be
governed by _Article VII_.

Section 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by:

(a) Salix and Cosmo by mutual written consent;

 

(b) Salix, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred by the close of
business on May 1, 2015 (the " _Salix Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) shall not
be available, if Salixs failure to fulfill any obligation under this

business on May 1, 2015 (the " _Cosmo Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that the

be available, if Cosmos failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before the Cosmo Outside Date;

 

(d) either Salix or Cosmo, if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which such Party shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as

or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or the Reorganization, and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

 



81 (e) either Salix or Cosmo, if the Salix Shareholders Approval shall not have
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Required Salix Vote upon
the taking of such vote(s) at a duly convened meeting of shareholders of
Salix, or at any adjournment thereof;

 

(f) Salix, if:

 

(i) the Cosmo Parties shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure (A)
would render the condition in Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(i) incapable
of being satisfied, and (B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured
by Cosmo within twenty (20) calendar days after written notice has been given
by Salix to Cosmo of such breach or failure to perform; or

 

(ii) Cosmo Holding shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in the Cosmo Holding Side Letter Agreement, which breach or failure

respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure (A) would render the
condition in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) incapable of being satisfied,
and (B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by Salix within
twenty (20) calendar days after written notice has been given by Cosmo to
Salix of such breach or failure to perform; or

(h) Salix, if any action, event or circumstance shall have occurred, which,
in the reasonable opinion of Salix could render the condition in Section
8.2(h) incapable of being satisfied.

 

Section 10.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either or both of Cosmo and Salix pursuant
to Section 10.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the
terminating Party to the other, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate
and become void and have no effect, and the Transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned without further action by the Parties, except that
Section 5.1(c), Section 5.7, and Section 9.5(g), and _Article I_ , _Article X_
and _Article XI_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided,
that, except as set forth in Section 10.3, such termination shall not relieve
any Party hereto of any liability for any breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.3 _Termination Payments_. (a) Cosmo shall pay to Salix the
Termination Fee by wire transfer to an account of Salix in immediately
available funds within two (2) Business Days of termination in the event that
this Agreement is terminated (i) by Salix pursuant to Section 10.1(f); (other
than if Salix so terminates this Agreement due to a breach of Section

 



82  5.6(a)(xxii)), or (ii) by Cosmo pursuant to Section 10.1(c), and, in the
case of this clause (ii), at any time on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to such termination any Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
and not withdrawn or formally (and, if such Acquisition Proposal was publicly
made, publicly) rejected by Cosmo, in each case, prior to such termination.

 

(b) Salix shall pay to Cosmo the Termination Fee by wire transfer to an
account of Cosmo in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days
of termination in the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) in
accordance with Section 10.1(g) or (ii) in accordance with Section 10.1(b),
and in the case of this clause (ii), such termination is a result of the
failure to satisfy Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.2(k).

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
10.3 are an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that without such provisions the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. If either Salix or Cosmo, as the case may be, fails to pay
the Termination Fee or any portion thereof and the other Party commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Party that failed to pay for the
respective Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the losing Party shall also
pay the prevailing Partys costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount due pursuant to this Section 10.3 from the date such
payment was due in accordance with the terms hereof until the date of
payment, at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

 

(d) In the circumstances in which a Termination Fee is payable in accordance
with this Section 10.3, (i) each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
a Partys receipt of the requisite Termination Fee from the other Party
pursuant to this Section 10.3 is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that is intended to compensate the other
Parties, solely in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable,
for efforts and resources expended and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate without precision, (ii) a Partys receipt of the
requisite Termination Fee from the other Party pursuant to this Section 10.3
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such recipient Party against the
other Party, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective former, current
and future Affiliates, Representatives, and permitted assignees for any loss
or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, and (iii) in the
event a Termination Fee is paid in accordance with this Section 10.3, none of
Cosmo, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current and future
Affiliates, Representatives, or permitted assignees, on the one hand (other
than Cosmo Holding in the event of a willful or intentional material beach or
failure to perform any of its covenants or agreements in the Cosmo Holding
Side Letter Agreement), or Salix, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current and future Affiliates, Representatives, and permitted
assignees, on the other hand, shall have any further liability or obligation
to Salix or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or to Cosmo or
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith; _provided_ , that
in no event shall a Partys liability for the willful or intentional material
beach or failure to perform any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement be limited (it 

 



83  being understood and agreed that the failure to consummate the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the event that all of the conditions to
Closing have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement shall
be deemed a willful or intentional material breach of this Agreement);
_provided_ , further, that this Section 10.3(e) shall not limit the right of
any Party to seek specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.10 and the remedies related thereto prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

ARTICLE XI

other Parties. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages
by facsimile transmission (whether directly from one facsimile device to
another by means of a dial-up connection or whether mediated by the worldwide
web), by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by
any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, or by combination of such means, shall

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to submit itself, and hereby
submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or,
if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of
the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any of
the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) agrees that it will not

mail, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt
of such registered mail; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 11.2(b)
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this 

 



84  Section 11.2(b) shall not constitute a general consent to service of process
in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as

any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN

Section 11.3 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and

other than those set forth or referred to herein. Except for Section 7.2,
which is intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the Salix Tax
Indemnitees, Section 9.2 which is intended to benefit, and be enforceable by,
the Salix Indemnified Parties, and Section 9.3 which is intended to benefit,
and be enforceable by, the Cosmo Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is not

is not consummated, all legal, investment banking and other costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, any
aspect of the Reorganization or the other Transactions contemplated hereby

avoidance of doubt, any costs incurred in connection with the Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, any aspect of the Reorganization or the other
Transactions contemplated hereby by Cosmo and its Subsidiaries, (including
the Tech Group Entities) prior to the Closing, including any arrangements
referred to in Section 3.18 with respect to the Cosmo Financial Advisors
(including any indemnity obligations to the Cosmo Financial Advisors), shall

Section 11.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; provided, that no Party may assign its
rights or delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of law or otherwise, without the express prior written consent of
each other Party. Any assignment in violation of the proviso in the preceding
sentence shall be null and void.

 

Section 11.7 _Headings; Definitions_. The section and article headings
contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only
and are not intended to be a part of or affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

 



87 Section 11.8 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Any
Party may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by another Party
with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party
to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any
term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach.

 

Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other applicable Governmental
Authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other terms, conditions, covenants and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as
the foregoing can be accomplished without preventing the Parties from
realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger,
Reorganization and other Transactions that they currently anticipate obtaining
therefrom. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 11.10 _Enforcement_. Subject to Section 10.3(e), the Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any Party fails to
consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically that the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any federal court or state court located in
the State of Delaware, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each Party agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the
event a court determines that such a breach or threatened breach has occurred,
and to waive any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy.

 



88 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed
and delivered as of the date first written above.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

 

Section 3.1 _Board Representation_. (a) Subject to clause (ii) of _Section
3.1(h)_, from and after the Closing Date until a Board Right Termination
Event occurs (the "Board Right Period"), the Original Shareholder shall have
the right (but not the obligation), upon written notice to the Company, to
designate one individual to serve on the Board (the "Shareholder Designee");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Shareholder Designee shall satisfy the
requirements set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if
a Board Right Termination Event occurs, the Original Shareholder shall
promptly cause the Shareholder Designee, if any, then serving on the Board to
resign, effective immediately, from the Board and from any committees or
subcommittees thereof to which the Shareholder Designee is then appointed or
on which he or she is then serving, and the right of the Original Shareholder
to designate a Shareholder Designee shall terminate. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Alessandro Della Cha was designated by the Original Shareholder to
serve on the Board and, effective at the Closing, Alessandro Della Cha was
appointed to and is serving on the Board as the Shareholder Designee.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any
Shareholder Designee designated by the Original Shareholder pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ or _Section 3.1(e)_ (i) shall not, at the time of such
designation, be required to disclose any information pursuant to Item 2(d) or
(e) of Schedule 13D (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) if such
Shareholder Designee were the "person filing" such Schedule 13D; (ii) shall
not, at the time of such designation, be prohibited or disqualified from
serving as a director of a public company pursuant to any applicable rule or
regulation of the SEC or NASDAQ or pursuant to applicable law, including the

Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (the "Nominating Committee"),
satisfy the requirements set forth in the Companys Organizational Documents
and Corporate Governance Guidelines (as in effect from time to time), in each
case as are applicable to all non-employee Directors generally; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 3.1(b)_, the Company agrees
that Alessandro Della Cha (A) satisfies, on the date of this Agreement, the
requirements set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this _Section
3.1(b)_ and (B) shall, after the date of this Agreement, be deemed to satisfy
the requirements set forth in clause (iii) of this _Section 3.1(b)_ for so
long as Alessandro Della Cha meets the requirements set forth clauses (i) and
(ii) of this _Section 3.1(b)_. The Shareholder Designee shall, upon
appointment or election, as the case may be, to the Board, execute such
agreements as are required to be executed by all non-employee Directors
generally, including agreements relating to confidentiality and non-use of
information, and shall otherwise abide by the provisions of all codes and
policies of the Company that are in effect from time to time and applicable

Shareholders rights under this _Section 3.1_.

Shareholder pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ shall be appointed to the Board as

shall be validly noticed; and (ii) at each annual general meeting of
shareholders of the Company occurring during the Board Right Period at which
the term of the Shareholder Designee will expire in accordance with the
Companys Organizational Documents (whether by rotation or otherwise), the
election or re-election, as the case may be, of the applicable Shareholder
Designee to the Board, including by (A) nominating such Shareholder Designee
for election to serve as a Director as provided in this Agreement, (B)
subject to compliance by the Original Shareholder with _Section 3.1(f)_,
including such nomination and other required information regarding such
Shareholder Designee in the Companys proxy materials for such meeting of
shareholders and (C) soliciting or causing the solicitation of proxies in
favor of the election of such Shareholder Designee as a Director, for a term
expiring at the next annual general meeting of shareholders at which members
of the class of Directors to which the Shareholder Designee belongs are to be
elected or re-elected, as the case may be, or until such Shareholder
Designees successor shall have been elected and qualified, or at such earlier
time, if any, as such Shareholder Designee may resign, retire, die or be
removed (for any reason) from office.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be obligated to procure the appointment of any individual to
the Board pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ or to procure the election or re-
election of any individual pursuant to  _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ if such
individual shall have previously been designated by the Original Shareholder
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and nominated by the Company for election or re-
election, as the case may be, as a Director as provided in _Section
3.1(c)(ii)_ (and _provided_ that the Company shall have complied with its
obligations set forth in _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ in respect thereof), and,
following the vote of shareholders at the annual general meeting of
shareholders, shall have failed to be elected or re-elected, as the case may
be, as a Director by the requisite vote of the Companys shareholders.

 

(e) In furtherance of, and not in limitation to, the Original Shareholders
rights in this _Section 3.1_, during the Board Right Period, (i) the
Original Shareholder shall have the right (but not the obligation), upon
written notice to the Company as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_, to designate a
Shareholder Designee to replace any Shareholder Designee who shall have
resigned, retired, died or been removed (for any reason) from office or who,
following the voting of shareholders at a meeting of shareholders of the
Company shall have failed to be elected or re-elected, as the case may be, by
the requisite vote of the Companys shareholders; and (ii) the provisions of
_Section 3.1(c)_ and _Section 3.1(d)_ shall apply to, and the Company shall
comply with its obligations contained therein in respect of, any
such replacement Shareholder Designee.

(f) Within thirty (30) days after written notice from the Company, the
Original Shareholder shall (i) notify the Company in writing of the name of
the Shareholder Designee to be nominated for election at any annual general
meeting of the shareholders of the Company; and (ii) provide, or cause such
Shareholder Designee to provide, to the Company, all information concerning
such Shareholder Designee and his or her nomination to be elected as a
Director at such meeting as shall be reasonably requested by the Company in
order to

 



A-12  (A) comply with the Companys Organizational Documents, applicable
securities laws, the rules of NASDAQ or any other stock exchange on which
securities of the Company are then quoted or listed for trading and the
Companies Acts and (B) enable the Nominating Committee to make determinations
with respect to such Shareholder Designees satisfaction of the requirements
set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_; _provided_  that the Nominating Committee
shall make such determinations as promptly as practicable following receipt by
the Company of the notification and information contemplated in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this _Section 3.1(f)_ and shall promptly provide the Original
Shareholder with written notice if the Nominating Committee determines that
such Shareholder Designee does not satisfy such requirements (together with a
reasonably detailed description of the basis on which the Nominating
Committee shall have made such determination).

(g) During the Board Right Period, the Company agrees that any
Shareholder Designee serving as a Director shall be entitled to the same
rights, privileges and compensation applicable to all other non-employee
Directors generally or to which all such non-employee Directors are entitled,
including any rights with respect to such Shareholder Designees term of
office, and with respect to indemnification arrangements, directors and
officers insurance coverage and other similar protections and expense
reimbursement.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 3.1_ to the contrary, (i) the
Company will not be obligated to take any action in respect of any
Shareholder Designee pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ if the Original
Shareholder shall have failed, in any material respect, to provide, or cause
to be provided, the notice and information required by clauses (i) and (ii)
of _Section 3.1(f)_; and (ii) in the event that a breach of _ARTICLE IV_ or
_ARTICLE V_ by any Shareholder, or a breach of the Letter Agreement by Cosmo
Holding, in either case, shall have occurred and be continuing, in addition
to any other remedies that the Company may have, the Original Shareholders
right to designate a Shareholder Designee shall be suspended; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such right shall be reinstated and become effective from and
after the date on which any such default shall have been cured or remedied
until a Board Right Termination Event occurs.

 

(i) During the Board Right Period and except as required by applicable law,
the Company shall not take any action to cause the removal (without cause) of
a Shareholder Designee serving as a Director. The Shareholder Designee shall,
and, at the request of the Company, the Original Shareholder shall cause the
Shareholder Designee to, resign or, if reasonably sufficient, recuse himself
or herself any time the presence of such individual as a Shareholder Designee
on the Board shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Board, reasonably be
likely to violate applicable law, represent an actual or potential conflict of
interest or otherwise compromise the Boards exercise of its fiduciary
duties. In particular, if any matter to be considered or voted on at a meeting
of the Board or any committee thereof, relates, directly or indirectly, to (A)
any business opportunity which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is then
engaged in, pursuing or evaluating, the Original Shareholder or any of its
controlled Affiliates is then engaged in, pursuing or evaluating the same or a
similar opportunity and, in the reasonable judgment of the Board or to the
knowledge of the Shareholder Designee, there exists an actual or potential
conflict of interest between the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Original Shareholder and its controlled Affiliates, on the
other hand, in respect of such matter or (B) the Company exercising or
enforcing, or evaluating the exercise or enforcement of, any rights or
remedies against any Shareholder or any of its Affiliates in relation to any
matter arising

 



A-13  under this Agreement or otherwise, then, in the case of each of clauses (A)
and (B), such matter shall be considered at a separate meeting or session of
the Board or such committee, and the Shareholder Designee shall not be
entitled to (x) attend or participate in any Board or committee discussion of
such matter, (y) receive any materials or advice prepared for or received by
the Company, the Board or any committee thereof in respect of such matter, or
(z) vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting or session) in respect of
such matter.

Agreement to the contrary, the Shareholder Designee shall not, and the
Original Shareholder shall cause the Shareholder Designee not to, communicate
or convey to any Shareholder or any Affiliate of a Shareholder, directly or
indirectly, any non-public information received or obtained in his or her
capacity as a Director, including materials distributed to Directors and any
information regarding the process or substance of any Board deliberations.

(b) Each Shareholder shall, and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates
to, use non-public information obtained under, in connection with or in
performance of this Agreement solely for the purpose of monitoring and
evaluating such Shareholders investment in the Company and in compliance with
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and not for any other purpose;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.2(b)_ shall, in any
way, prevent, restrict, encumber or limit the Shareholders or any of their
respective Affiliates from exercising their respective rights or performing
their respective obligations, or asserting or defending any claim by or
against the Company or any of its Affiliates, in any such case under this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Shareholder shall, and
each Shareholder shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, use
any such information in a manner prohibited by applicable law, including
trading any securities of the Company while in possession of such non-public
information to the extent such trading would violate applicable law, or
expressly prohibited by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

of determining the presence of a quorum at such meeting.

 

Section 4.3 _Voting_. (a) At each meeting of shareholders of the Company
(including any adjournments or postponements thereof) occurring during the
period from the Closing Date until the three (3) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, and provided that no breach by the Company of any of its
obligations set forth in _Section 3.1_ shall have occurred and then be
continuing, each Shareholder shall vote all Shareholders Shares then owned by
it (to the extent entitled to vote thereon), as applicable, (i) in favor of
all nominees of the Company in its proxy statement for such meeting for
election to the Board; (ii) against any shareholder nominations for Director
which are not recommended by the Board for election; (iii) against any
shareholder proposals or resolutions to remove any Director; and (iv) in favor
of all "say on pay" resolutions recommended by the Board.

 



A-17 (b) Following the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, and provided
that no breach by the Company of any of its obligations set forth in _Section
3.1_ shall have occurred and then be continuing, each Shareholder shall
continue to vote as described in paragraph (a) of this _Section 4.3_, except
that, if, at any date following the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Shareholders Beneficially Own, in the aggregate, Voting Securities
representing less than the Ownership Threshold, each Shareholder shall
thereafter be free to vote or abstain from voting any or all Shareholder
Shares then owned by it in any manner it shall determine, in its absolute and
sole discretion, in respect of, any business or proposal (whether initiated by
any shareholder or otherwise) coming before any meeting of shareholders of
the Company.

Section 4.4 _Pre-emptive Rights_. Except as expressly set forth in this 
_Section 4.4_, each Shareholder hereby irrevocably waives, at all times while
the Shareholders Beneficially Own, in the aggregate, Voting Securities equal
to or greater than the Ownership Threshold, any pre-emptive rights to which it
would otherwise be entitled as a result of its ownership or holding of
Shareholder Shares under the Companies Acts or the Organizational Documents of
the Company in respect of any issuance or offering of equity securities by the
Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, none of the Shareholders hereby
waive, by virtue of this _Section 4.4_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 4.4_ or any other provision of this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of, or otherwise operate to waive, any
pre-emptive right if and solely to the extent that other shareholders of the
Company have, and have not waived, any pre-emptive rights in respect of such
issuance or offering.

 

ARTICLE V

this _ARTICLE V_. No Transfer of Shareholder Shares by any Shareholder may be
effected except in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this _ARTICLE
V_ and with the requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable
securities laws. Any attempted Transfer in violation of this Agreement shall

A-18 (b) During the Transfer Limitation Period, no Shareholder shall Transfer any
Shareholder Shares without the prior written consent of the Company, except:

(i) following the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Shareholders may collectively, subject to _Section 5.3_, Transfer up to but
no more than fifty-five percent (55%) of the Shareholder Shares, in the
aggregate, in a single marketed underwritten registered (including,
for avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Initial Shelf Registration Statement)
offering pursuant to _ARTICLE VI_; and

 

(ii) from and after the date that is ninety (90) days after, and conditioned
upon, the completion of the Transfer under clause (i) of this _Section
5.1(b)_ (and irrespective of the number of Shareholder Shares actually
Transferred thereunder), the Shareholders may collectively, subject to
_Section 5.3_, Transfer up to but not more than fifty percent (50%) of the
Shareholder Shares, in the aggregate, in a single marketed underwritten
registered (including, for avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Initial Shelf
Registration Statement) offering pursuant to _ARTICLE VI_.

 

(c) Following the Transfer Limitation Period, each Shareholder may, subject to
_Section 5.1(e)_ and _Section 5.2(c)_, Transfer its Shareholder Shares
without the prior consent of the Company and without restriction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that:

 

(i) any Transfer of Shareholder Shares effected pursuant to an SEC-registered

the requirements of _ARTICLE VI_;

(ii) in connection with any Transfer of Shareholder Shares (A) effected
pursuant to a Directed Offering or a privately-negotiated transaction not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in each case
in which a Shareholder or any of its Representatives negotiates the terms of
such Transfer directly with the third party purchaser(s) of such Shareholder
Shares or (B) effected in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
in each case no Shareholder shall knowingly Transfer to any Person or Group
(whether such Person or Group is purchasing Shareholder Shares for its or
their own account(s) or as fiduciary on behalf of one or more accounts) in a
single Transfer or series of related Transfers, Shareholder Shares
representing more than five percent (5%) of the Voting Securities then
outstanding (calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of Voting
Securities outstanding, as contained in the then most recently-available
filing by the Company with the SEC) and each Shareholder shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, inform any underwriters or brokers engaged by or
acting on behalf of such Shareholder in connection with any such Transfer of
the provisions of this _Section 5.1(c)(ii)_;

 

(iii) in connection with any Transfer of Shareholder Shares (A) effected
pursuant to a Directed Offering or a privately-negotiated transaction not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in each case
in which a Shareholder or any of its Representatives negotiates the terms of
such Transfer directly with the third 

 



A-19  party purchaser(s) of such Shareholder Shares or (B) effected in accordance
with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, in each case no Shareholder shall
knowingly Transfer to any Person or Group (whether such Person or Group is
purchasing Shareholder Shares for its or their own account(s) or as fiduciary
on behalf of one or more accounts) that (x) is not a Person (or, in the case
of a Group, does not consist entirely of Persons) of the type described in
Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act (as in effect on the date of this
Agreement), other than a hedge fund, unless such Person is a private equity

writing that it has no intent to change or influence the control of the
Company or participate in any transaction having that effect as described in
Rule 13d-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act or (y) is a Person that has
engaged in a proxy contest or has otherwise filed a Schedule 13D that
disclosed any plan or proposal or other intent to change or influence control
over an issuer, in either case described in this clause (y) during the two (2)
year period immediately preceding the date of such Transfer and such
Shareholder shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, inform any
underwriters or brokers engaged by or acting on behalf of such Shareholder in
connection with any such Transfer of the provisions of this _Section
5.1(c)(ii)_.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) for the avoidance of doubt, none of 
_Section 5.1(b)_, _Section 5.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 5.1(c)(iii)_ shall apply
to, and nothing therein shall directly or indirectly prohibit, restrict or
otherwise limit, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, any Transfer of
Shareholder Shares made in accordance with _Section 5.1(f)_; and (ii) the
restrictions set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_, _Section 5.1(c)(ii)_ and
_Section 5.1(c)(iii)_ shall terminate at such time following the Transfer
Limitation Period as the Shareholders shall cease to Beneficially Own, in the
aggregate, Voting Securities representing at least five percent (5%) of the
Voting Securities outstanding at such time.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for Transfers made pursuant to
_Section 5.1(b)_ or _Section 5.1(f)_, no Shareholder shall effect any
Transfer of Shareholder Shares in any manner that would result in the failure
of such Shareholder to comply with its obligations under _Section 6.10_ in
respect of any Holdback Period.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _ARTICLE V_,
each Shareholder may, at any time (during or after the Transfer Limitation
Period), (i) Transfer Shareholder Shares to a Permitted Transferee; _provided_
that, prior to any such Transfer, such Permitted Transferee agrees, pursuant
to a joinder agreement in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (a
"Joinder Agreement"), duly executed and delivered to the Company by such
Permitted Transferee, to acquire and hold such Transferred Shareholder Shares
subject to and in accordance with, and otherwise to be bound by the terms of,
this Agreement as a Shareholder; _provided_ , _further_ , that if, at any time
after such Transfer, such Permitted Transferee ceases to be a wholly-owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Original Shareholder, the Original
Shareholder shall cause all Shareholder Shares held by such Permitted
Transferee to be Transferred to a Person that is, at such time, a Permitted
Transferee and that, in the case of a Permitted Transferee that is not then a
Shareholder, prior to such Transfer, agrees in writing with the Company,
pursuant to a Joinder Agreement duly executed and delivered to the Company by
such Permitted Transferee, to acquire and hold such Transferred Shareholder
Shares subject to and in accordance with this Agreement as a Shareholder;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Original

 



A-20  Shareholder shall be jointly and severally liable with each Permitted
Transferee to which Shareholder Shares are Transferred for all obligations of
the Permitted Transferee as a Permitted Transferee and Shareholder under this
this Agreement; (ii) Transfer Shareholder Shares to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, including pursuant to any redemption, share
repurchase program, self tender offer or otherwise; or (iii) Transfer
Shareholder Shares pursuant to any (A) recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, share exchange, scheme of arrangement or other business
combination transaction involving the Company, in any case

Board or approved by the shareholders of the Company or (B) tender, exchange
or other similar offer for any Voting Securities that is commenced by any
Person or Group and the Board either (x) publicly recommends that
shareholders of the Company tender their Voting Securities to the Person or
Group making such offer or (y) fails to recommend that the shareholders of the
Company reject such offer, in either case within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of commencement thereof.

Section 5.2 _Legends on Shareholder Shares; Securities Act Compliance_. (a)
Each share certificate representing Shareholder Shares shall bear the
following legend (and a comparable notation or other arrangement will be made
with respect to any uncertificated Shareholder Shares):

 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED. SUCH SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE
ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE ISSUER RECEIVES AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO IT STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS
EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID
ACT."

(b) In addition, for so long as any restrictions set forth in _Section 5.1_
remain in effect, such legend or notation shall include the following
language:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS
OF A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF [], 2014, AMONG THE ISSUER AND THE
OTHER PARTIES THERETO, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE INSPECTED AT THE PRINCIPAL
OFFICE OF THE ISSUER OR OBTAINED FROM THE ISSUER WITHOUT CHARGE."

(c) The Original Shareholder agrees that it will, if requested by the Company,
deliver at its expense to the Company an opinion of reputable U.S. counsel
selected by the Original Shareholder and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(it being agreed that Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves and Savitch LLP is acceptable
to the Company), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company
and counsel for the Company, that any Transfer made by a Shareholder, other
than in connection with an SEC-registered offering by the Company, does not
require registration under the Securities Act.

 



A-21 (d) In connection with any Transfer pursuant to this _ARTICLE V_, the Company
shall remove such portion of the legend (or eliminate or terminate such
portion of the notation or arrangement) described in _Section 5.2(a)_ and
_Section 5.2(b)_ as is appropriate under the circumstances. At such time as
the Original Shareholder delivers at its expense to the Company an opinion of
reputable U.S. counsel selected by the Original Shareholder and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (it being agreed that Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves and
Savitch LLP is acceptable to the Company), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and counsel for the Company, that all of the
Shareholder Shares held by the Shareholders may be freely sold without
registration under the Securities Act, the Company agrees that it will
promptly after the later of the delivery of such opinion and, in the case of
certificated Shareholder Shares, the delivery by the Shareholders to the
Company or its transfer agent of a certificate or certificates (in the case
of a Transfer, in the proper form for Transfer) representing such Shareholder
Shares issued with the legend set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, deliver or cause
to be delivered to such Shareholders a replacement stock certificate
or certificates representing such Shareholder Shares that is free from the
legend set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ (or in the case of uncertificated
Shareholder Shares, free of any notation or arrangement set forth in 
_Section 5.2(a)_). At such time as no restrictions set forth in _Section
5.1_ remain in effect with respect to the Shareholder Shares held by the
Shareholders, the Company agrees that it will, promptly upon the request of
the Original Shareholder, and, in the case of certificated Shareholder
Shares, the delivery by the Shareholders to the Company or its transfer agent
of a certificate or certificates (in the case of a Transfer, in the proper
form for Transfer) representing Shareholder Shares issued with the legend set
forth in _Section 5.2(b)_, deliver or cause to be delivered to such
Shareholders a replacement stock certificate or certificates representing such
Shareholder Shares that is free from the legend set forth in _Section
5.2(b)_ (or in the case of uncertificated Shareholder Shares, free of any
notation or arrangement set forth in _Section 5.2(b)_).

 

Section 5.3 _Shareholder Transfer_. (a) In the event that the Original
Shareholder delivers (i) a Piggyback Request; (ii) a Demand Request that
provides that the Demand Shareholders intend the Registrable Shares covered
thereby shall be distributed by means of an underwritten offering; or (iii) a
Take-Down Notice (in any such case, whether in respect of Registrable Shares
held by the Original Shareholder or any other Shareholder, an "Underwritten
Offering Notice"), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by Irish law,
have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase (by way of redemption or
otherwise) from the Demand Shareholders all, but not less than all, of the
Registrable Shares covered by such Underwritten Offering Notice. The Companys
right under this _Section 5.3_ shall be exercisable by delivering a written
election notice to the Original Shareholder (such notice, a "Transfer Election
Notice") within ten (10) Business Days after the date of receipt by the
Company of such Underwritten Offering Notice from the Original Shareholder.
The delivery of a Transfer Election Notice by the Company shall irrevocably
bind the Company to purchase, and each Demand Shareholder to sell, all of the
Registrable Shares covered by such Underwritten Offering Notice,
in accordance with this _Section 5.3_. In the event that the Company fails
to deliver a Transfer Election Notice within such ten (10) Business Day
period, the Company shall be deemed to have irrevocably elected not to
exercise its right to purchase such Registrable Shares in respect of such
Underwritten Offering Notice, pursuant to this _Section 5.3_. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Transfer of Shares pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_ shall
be deemed to be made pursuant to an Underwritten Offering Notice.

 



A-22 (b) The purchase price for the Registrable Shares in respect of which a
Transfer Election Notice is delivered by the Company shall equal the product
of (i) the aggregate number of Registrable Shares covered by such Underwritten
Offering Notice; _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the Market Value of each such
Registrable Share determined as on the date of receipt by the Company of such
Underwritten Offering Notice (the "Transfer Purchase Price").

(c) Subject to the receipt of all necessary shareholder, antitrust and other
governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, the closing of the
purchase of the Registrable Shares pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall take
place at the executive offices of the Company at 10:00 a.m., local time, on
the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date the Transfer Election Notice is
delivered by the Company to the Original Shareholder, or on such later
Business Day reasonably designated by the Company or the Original
Shareholder, in order to permit (i) any necessary antitrust waiting period to
expire; and (ii) any other necessary governmental, regulatory or third party
approvals to be obtained. At such closing, the Original Shareholder shall
deliver to the Company, either in electronic book-entry form or through the
delivery of a certificate or certificates, as the case may be, all Registrable
Shares in respect of which such Transfer Election Notice was delivered, in
exchange for the payment in full of the Transfer Purchase Price for such
Registrable Shares by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts that shall be designated by the Original Shareholder in
writing to the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to such closing.

ARTICLE VI

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 

Section 6.1 _Demand Request_. (a) Until the Registration Rights Termination
Date, in connection with any Transfer by any Demand Shareholder of
Registrable Shares permitted under _Section 5.1(b)_, the Original Shareholder
shall, on behalf of each such Demand Shareholder, and in connection with any
other Transfer by any Demand Shareholder of Registrable Shares after the
Transfer Limitation Period, the Original Shareholder may, on behalf of each
such Demand Shareholder, request in writing that the Company effect a
registration under the Securities Act of all or such portion of the
Registrable Shares as the Original Shareholder indicates that the Demand
Shareholders, in the aggregate, wish to Transfer, subject in each case to the
maximum and minimum threshold requirements applicable to such registration
pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_,  _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ (such
request, a "Demand Request") (it being understood that the Demand Request in
respect of the marketed underwritten offering to be effected under  _Section
5.1(b)(i)_ may be made no sooner than forty-five (45) days before the one (1)
year anniversary of the Closing Date, but may be made at any time thereafter);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Original Shareholder shall not make a
Demand Request at any time when the Initial Shelf Registration Statement is in
effect. Each Demand Request shall specify (i) the aggregate number of
Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the Demand
Shareholders pursuant to such Demand Request; (ii) the intended method of
disposition in connection with such Demand Request, to the extent then known;
and (iii) the

 



A-23  identity of such Demand Shareholders. Upon receipt of any Demand Request,
the Company shall use reasonable endeavors to file, as promptly as
practicable, but in any event not later than the date that is forty-five (45)
days after receipt by the Company of such Demand Request, in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, a Registration Statement with the SEC (a
"Demand Registration Statement") covering all such Registrable Shares, in
accordance with the method of distribution thereof set forth in the Demand
Request (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be limited to marketed
underwritten registered offerings in the case of a Transfer under  _Section
5.1(b)_). Any registration requested by the Original Shareholder under this
_Section 6.1(a)_, _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(e)_ is referred to in
this Agreement as a "Demand Registration."

(b) The Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, shall be
entitled to initiate no more than four (4) Demand Registrations, including
Shelf Underwritten Offerings, in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be obligated to effect such Demand Registration (i) if
the Initial Shelf Registration Statement is then in effect; (ii) unless the
number of Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, is at least four million
(4,000,000) (or the equivalent thereof as of the Closing Date in the event of
any stock splits); and (iii) during the ninety (90) calendar day period
following the effective date of a Registration Statement pursuant to any other
Demand Registration, including any Shelf Registration Statement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Initial Shelf Registration Statement shall not count
for the purposes of the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.1(b)_ or
_Section 6.1(c)_. No request for registration shall count for the purposes
of the limitations in this _Section 6.1(b)_ if (A) the Original Shareholder
determines, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, in good faith to withdraw
(prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement relating to such
request) the proposed registration, upon written notice to the Company, due to
marketing conditions or regulatory reasons prior to the execution of an
underwriting agreement or purchase agreement relating to such request; 
_provided_ that the Original Shareholder reimburses the Company for all
Registration Expenses incurred in good faith by the Company in connection with
such Demand Registration prior to the date of such withdrawal, (B) the
Registration Statement relating to a Demand Request is not declared effective
within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the date such Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC (other than by reason of the Original
Shareholder or a Demand Shareholder having refused to proceed or a
misrepresentation or an omission by the Original Shareholder or a Demand
Shareholder), (C) prior to the sale of at least fifty percent (50%) of the
Registrable Shares included in the applicable registration relating to a
Demand Request, such registration is adversely affected by any stop order,
injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental
agency or court for any reason and the Company fails to have such stop order,
injunction, or other order or requirement removed, withdrawn or resolved to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Original Shareholder within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date of such order, (D) the Original
Shareholder withdraws the request in the circumstances described in _Section
6.1(f)_ or (E) the conditions to closing specified in any underwriting
agreement or purchase agreement entered into in connection with the
registration relating to such request are not satisfied as a result of a
default or breach thereunder by the Company that proximately and primarily
caused the failure of such conditions.

 



A-24 (c) The Company shall use reasonable endeavors to qualify, no later than the
date that is thirty (30) days prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, for registration on Form S-3 or any comparable or successor form
or forms or any similar short-form registration (a "Short-Form Registration").
Subject to the availability of a Short-Form Registration Statement to the
Company, not later than the date that is thirty (30) days prior to one (1)
year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company shall file a "shelf"
registration statement providing for the registration, and the sale on a
continuous or delayed basis, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or
otherwise (a "Shelf Registration Statement"), of all Registrable Shares held
by all Demand Shareholders (such Shelf Registration Statement, the "Initial
Shelf Registration Statement"). Following the Transfer Limitation Period and
prior to the Registration Rights Termination Date, the Original Shareholder
may, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, request no more than three (3)
Shelf Registration Statements, if available to the Company, with respect to
the Registrable Shares, which shall count toward the four (4) Demand
Registrations to which the Demand Shareholders are entitled pursuant to
_Section 6.1(b)_; _provided_ that, except for the Initial Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company shall not be obligated to effect any Short-Form
Registration pursuant to this  _Section 6.1(c)_, (i) if the Initial Shelf
Registration Statement is then in effect; (ii) unless the number of
Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the Original Shareholder on
behalf of the Demand Shareholders is at least four million (4,000,000) (or
the equivalent thereof as of the Closing Date in the event of any stock
splits); or (iii) during the ninety (90) calendar day period following the
effective date of a Registration Statement pursuant to any other Demand
Registration, including any Shelf Registration Statement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Initial Shelf Registration Statement shall not count for the
purposes of the limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or this  _Section
6.1(c)_. In no event shall the Company be obligated to effect any shelf
registration other than pursuant to a Short-Form Registration. If any Demand
Registration is proposed to be a Short-Form Registration and an
underwritten offering, if the managing underwriter(s) shall advise the
Company and the Original Shareholder that, in its good faith opinion, it is of
material importance to the success of such proposed offering to include in
such Registration Statement information not required to be included in a
Short-Form Registration, then the Company shall supplement the Short-Form
Registration as reasonably requested by such managing underwriter(s).

 

(d) Upon filing any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall use
reasonable endeavors to keep such Shelf Registration Statement effective with
the SEC and to cooperate in any shelf take-down, whether or not underwritten,
by amending or supplementing the Prospectus related to such Shelf Registration
Statement as may be reasonably requested by the Original Shareholder, or
as otherwise required, until the earlier of (i) such time as all Registrable
Shares that could be sold in such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold
or are no longer outstanding; and (ii) the Registration Rights Termination
Date.

 

(e) To the extent that the Company is a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (a "WKSI") at the time any Demand
Request for a Short-Form Registration is submitted to the Company and,
pursuant to such Demand Request, the Original Shareholder requests that the
Company file a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall file an
automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) on Form S-3 (an "Automatic Shelf Registration Statement") in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, which covers those Registrable Shares which
are requested to be registered. At the written request of the Original
Shareholder, the Company shall pay the registration fee in respect of a take-
down from an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement promptly and, in any
event, within

 



A-25  two (2) Business Days after receiving such written request. The Company
shall use reasonable endeavors to remain a WKSI (and not to become an
ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)) during
the period in which any Automatic Shelf Registration Statement is effective.
If, at any time following the filing of an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement when the Company is required to re-evaluate its WKSI status, the
Company determines that it is not a WKSI, the Company shall use reasonable
endeavors to post-effectively amend the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement
to a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 or file a new Shelf
Registration Statement on Form S-3, have such Shelf Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC and keep such Registration Statement effective
during the period in which such Short-Form Registration is required to be kept
effective in accordance with  _Section 6.1(d)_.

(f) If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of (x) a
Registration Statement, including a Shelf Registration Statement, with
respect to a Demand Registration, or (y) the Initial Shelf Registration
Statement, would require the Company to make a public disclosure of material
non-public information, which disclosure the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with external legal counsel), (i) would be required to be
made at such time in any Registration Statement so that such Registration
Statement would not be materially misleading; (ii) would not be required to
be made at such time but for the filing, effectiveness or continued use of
such Registration Statement; and (iii) would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the Company or its business or on the Companys ability to
effect a reasonably imminent material proposed acquisition, disposition,
financing, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction, then the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such determination to the
Original Shareholder, on behalf of each Demand Shareholder which elected to
participate, or is participating, in such Registration Statement, delay the
filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, as applicable, such
Registration Statement or a Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to do so (A) on more
than one (1) occasion in any six (6) month period or (B) for any single period
of time in excess of ninety (90) days. In the event that the Company
exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Original Shareholder
shall cause each Demand Shareholder which elected to participate, or is
participating, in such Registration Statement to, and each Demand Shareholder
which elected to participate, or is participating, in such Registration
Statement shall, suspend, promptly upon receipt by the Original Shareholder of
the notice referred to above, the use of any Prospectus relating to such
Demand Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Shares. If the Company so delays the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend the use of, as applicable, such Registration Statement or a Prospectus
or Free Writing Prospectus, the Original Shareholder shall be entitled, on
behalf of all Demand Shareholders, to withdraw such request and, if such
request is withdrawn, such registration request shall not count for the
purposes of the limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section
6.1(c)_.

(g) If a Demand Request provides that the Demand Shareholders intend
the Registrable Shares covered thereby shall be distributed by means of an
underwritten offering, or if the Original Shareholder delivers to the Company
a Take-Down Notice, the lead underwriter(s) to administer the offering shall
be chosen by the Company, subject to the prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, of the Original Shareholder.

 



A-26 (h) The Company shall not include in any Demand Registration pursuant to
this  _Section 6.1_ any securities that are not Registrable Shares without
the prior written consent of the Original Shareholder.

(i) The Original Shareholder shall have the right, on behalf of the Demand
Shareholders, to notify the Company prior to the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement relating to a Demand Registration that such
Registration Statement be abandoned or withdrawn, in which event the Company
shall promptly abandon or withdraw such Registration Statement.

Section 6.2 _Piggyback Registration_. (a) If, at any time following the
Transfer Limitation Period, the Company proposes or is required to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of
securities of the Company of the same class as the Registrable Shares (such
securities "Similar Securities"), whether or not for sale for its own account
(including a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3, but excluding a
Registration Statement that is (i) solely in connection with a Special
Registration; or (ii) pursuant to a Demand Registration in accordance with
_Section 6.1_ (including _Section 6.1(c))_, the Company shall give written
notice as promptly as practicable, but not later than thirty (30) calendar
days prior to the anticipated date of filing of such Registration Statement,
to the Original Shareholder of the Companys intention to effect such
registration and shall include in such registration all Registrable Shares
with respect to which the Company has received written notice from the
Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders (a "Piggyback
Request"), for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) calendar days after the
date of the Companys notice (a "Piggyback Registration"). Each Piggyback
Request shall specify (x) the aggregate number of Registrable Shares requested
to be registered by the Demand Shareholders pursuant to such Piggyback
Request; and (y) the identity of such Demand Shareholders. In the event that
the Original Shareholder makes such written request, the Original Shareholder
may, on behalf of such Demand Shareholders, withdraw the relevant Registrable
Shares from such Piggyback Registration by giving written notice to the
Company and the managing underwriter(s), if any, at any time at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
relating to such Piggyback Registration. The Company may terminate or withdraw
any Piggyback Registration under this _Section 6.2(a)_, whether or not the
Original Shareholder made a Piggyback Request in respect of such
registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Original Shareholder has
elected, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, to include Registrable Shares
in such registration and the Company terminates or withdraws such
Piggyback Registration after the date on which the applicable Registration
Statement is declared effective, the Company shall reimburse the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, for all Selling Expenses
paid by the Demand Shareholders in respect of Registrable Shares included
therein which are unsold on the date of such withdrawal or termination. No
Piggyback Registration shall count towards the number of Demand Registrations
to which the Shareholders are entitled under  _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section
6.1(c)_.

(b) If a Piggyback Registration under _Section 6.2(a)_ is proposed to be
underwritten, the Company shall so advise the Original Shareholder as a part
of the written notice given pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_. In such event, the
lead underwriter(s) to administer the offering shall be chosen by the
Company. 

 



A-27 (c) The Company shall pay all expenses (subject to and in accordance with 
_Section 6.5_) in connection with any Piggyback Registration, whether or not
any Registration Statement or Prospectus becomes effective or final or is
terminated or withdrawn by the Company.

 

(d) If any Similar Securities are to be sold in an underwritten primary
offering on behalf of the Company, the Demand Shareholders may include all
the Registrable Shares the Original Shareholder requests in such Piggyback
Registration on the same terms and conditions as such Similar Securities
included therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such offering involves a
firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter(s) of such
offering advises the Company and the Original Shareholder in writing that, in
its good faith opinion, the total number or dollar amount of Similar
Securities proposed to be sold in such offering and Registrable Shares
requested by the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders,
to be included therein, in the aggregate, exceeds the largest number or dollar
amount of securities that can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on
the per share offering price), the Company shall include in such registration
or prospectus only such number of securities that in the good faith opinion
of such managing underwriter(s) can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on
the per share offering price), which securities shall be included in the
following order of priority:

(i) _first_ , the securities that the Company proposes to sell;

 

(ii) _second_ , the Registrable Shares requested to be included by the Demand
Shareholders and any Similar Securities requested to be included by any other
Persons exercising their contractual rights to piggyback registration, _pro_
_rata_ (if applicable) on the basis of the aggregate number of securities so
requested to be included therein; and

 

(iii) _third_ , any securities requested to be included therein by any other
Persons (other than the Company and the Demand Shareholders and other Persons
with restricted piggyback registration rights), allocated among such Persons
in such manner as the Company may determine.

 

(e) If the securities to be registered pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ are to
be sold in an underwritten secondary offering on behalf of holders of Similar
Securities, the Original Shareholder may, on behalf of the Demand
Shareholders, include all Registrable Shares requested to be included in such
registration in such offering on the same terms and conditions as any
Similar Securities included therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
managing underwriter(s) of such offering advises the Company and the Original
Shareholder in writing that, in its good faith opinion, the total number or
dollar amount of securities to be included therein exceeds the largest number
or dollar amount of securities that can be sold in such offering without
adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse
effect on the per share offering price), the Company shall include in such
registration only such number of securities that in the reasonable opinion of
such managing underwriter(s) can be sold without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per share
offering price), which securities shall be so included in the following order
of priority:

 



A-28 (i) _first_ , the Similar Securities requested to be included therein by
the holders exercising their contractual rights to demand such registration
and the Registrable Shares requested to be included by the Demand
Shareholders, _pro_ _rata_ (if applicable) on the basis of the aggregate
number of securities so requested to be included therein by each such holder;
and

(ii) _second_ , any Similar Securities requested to be included therein by
the Company or any other Person not exercising a contractual right to demand
registration, allocated among such Persons in such manner as the Company may
determine.

 

Section 6.3 _Termination of Registration Obligation_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the obligation of the Company to register Registrable
Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE VI_ and maintain the effectiveness of any
Demand Registration Statement filed pursuant to _Section 6.1_ shall terminate
on the earliest of (a) the date on which reputable U.S. counsel shall have
delivered an opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and the Original Shareholder, that all remaining Shareholder Shares
Beneficially Owned by the Shareholders may be freely sold without
registration under the Securities Act, including under Rule 144 without being
subject to the volume limitations and manner of sale restrictions contained
therein; (b) the date that is four (4) months after the first date on which
the Shareholders Beneficially Own, in the aggregate, Shareholder Shares
representing less than the Ownership Threshold; and (c) the first date on
which the Shareholders Beneficially Own, in the aggregate, Shareholder Shares
representing less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Voting Securities
(the "Registration Rights Termination Date").

 

Section 6.4 _Registration Procedures_. Subject to _Section 6.1(c)_, whenever
the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, shall have
requested that any Registrable Shares be registered pursuant to _Section 6.1_
or _Section 6.2_, the Company shall use reasonable endeavors to effect, as
soon as practicable as provided herein, the registration and sale of such
Registrable Shares in accordance with the intended method or methods of
disposition thereof, until the Registration Rights Termination Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and pursuant thereto, the Company
shall, until the Registration Rights Termination Date, cooperate in the sale
of such Registrable Shares and shall, as expeditiously as possible:

 

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to
such Registrable Shares as provided herein, make all required filings with
FINRA and, if such Registration Statement is not automatically effective upon
filing, use reasonable endeavors to cause such Registration Statement to be
declared effective as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, before filing a Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (including free writing
prospectuses under Rule 433 under the Securities Act, each, a "Free
Writing Prospectus"), the Company shall furnish to the Original Shareholder,
on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, and the managing underwriter(s), if any,
copies of the Registration Statement and all other documents proposed to be
filed (including exhibits thereto), including, upon the reasonable request of
the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, and to the
extent reasonably practicable, all documents that would be incorporated by
reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, which
Registration Statement and documents will be subject to the reasonable review
and comment of the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders,
and the Original 

 



A-29  Shareholders counsel, at the Original Shareholders sole expense. The
Company shall not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto (including Free Writing Prospectuses) with
respect to any registration pursuant to _Section 6.1_ to which the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, and the Original
Shareholders counsel or the managing underwriter(s), if any, shall
reasonably object, in writing, on a timely basis, unless in the opinion of the
Company, such filing is necessary to comply with applicable law;

 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement, the Prospectus used in connection
therewith (including Free Writing Prospectuses) and Exchange Act reports as
may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for a period of
(i) with respect to a Registration Statement other than a Shelf Registration
Statement, (A) not less than four (4) months, (B) if such Registration
Statement relates to an underwritten offering, such longer period as, in the
opinion of counsel for the underwriter(s), a Prospectus is required by law to
be delivered in connection with sales of Registrable Shares by an underwriter
or dealer or (C) such shorter period as will terminate when all of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of distribution by the seller or sellers
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement (but in any event not before
the expiration of any longer period required under the Securities Act); or
(ii) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the period set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act

Statement until such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement;

 

(c) furnish to the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders,
and the managing underwriter(s), if any, such number of conformed copies,

Prospectus, all exhibits and other documents filed therewith and such
other documents as such Persons may reasonably request, including in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Shares in accordance with the
intended method or methods of disposition thereof; and the Company, subject to
the penultimate paragraph of this _Section 6.4_, hereby consents to the use

disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Shares in accordance with
the intended method of distribution thereof ( _provided_ that the
Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
subsection; (ii) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction wherein it is
not so subject; or (iii) take any action which would subject it to general
service of process in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so subject);

 



A-30 (e) use its reasonable endeavors to cause all Registrable Shares covered by
such Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other

if any, to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Shares in the United
States in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof;

 

(f) promptly notify the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand

reference therein) included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and, as promptly as practicable
upon discovery, prepare and furnish to the Original Shareholder, on behalf of
the Demand Shareholders, a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or
amendment to such Prospectus, or file any other required document, as may
be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to any prospective purchasers

effective amendment to the Registration Statement or any Free Writing
Prospectus has been filed and, with respect to such Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Registration
Statement or to such Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) of the
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such

transfer order with any transfer agent, and cause such Registrable Shares to
be issued in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing
underwriter(s), if any, may request in writing or, if not an underwritten
offering, in accordance with the instructions of the Original Shareholder, in
each case at least two (2) Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable
Shares;

 



A-31 (j) enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements with

directors, employees and independent accountants to supply all information

addressed to the Demand Shareholders, dated the effective date of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, and, if
requested by the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders,
dated the date of sale by the Demand Shareholders (and, if such registration
includes an underwritten public offering, including any Shelf Underwritten
Offering, addressed to each of the managing underwriter(s) and dated the date
of the closing under the underwriting agreement), with respect to the
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (including
the preliminary Prospectus) and such other documents relating thereto in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
legal opinions of such nature and such other matters as may be reasonably
requested by the Original Shareholders counsel (and, if applicable, by the

Subject to the limitations on the Companys ability to delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, as applicable, a
Registration Statement or a Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to
_Section 6.1(f)_, the Demand Shareholders each agree that, upon receipt by
the Original Shareholder of any written notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section 6.4(f)_, each
Demand Shareholders shall promptly discontinue its disposition of Registrable
Shares pursuant to any Registration Statement until the Original
Shareholders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus

Shareholder shall deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, in the Demand Shareholders

Registrable Shares or Similar Securities to be included in such offering or
registration, as the case may be, shall be subject to the applicable

Shareholders nor any holder of Similar Securities may participate in such
offering or registration unless such Person agrees to sell such Persons
securities on the basis provided therein; and (ii) neither the Demand
Shareholders nor any holder of Similar Securities may participate in such
offering or registration unless such Person completes and executes all
questionnaires, indemnities, underwriting agreements and

 



A-33  other documents (other than powers of attorney) reasonably required to be
executed in connection therewith, and provides such other information to the
Company or the underwriter(s) as may be reasonably requested to offer or
register such Persons Registrable Shares or Similar Securities, as the case
may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Demand Shareholders shall not be
required to make any representations or warranties other than those related
to title and ownership of, and power and authority to transfer, the
Registrable Shares included therein and as to the accuracy and completeness of
statements made in the applicable Registration Statement, Prospectus or other
document in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information
prepared and furnished to the Company or the managing underwriter(s) by the
Demand Shareholders pertaining exclusively to the Demand Shareholders and (B)
the aggregate amount of liability of the Demand Shareholders pursuant to any
indemnification obligation thereunder shall not exceed the net proceeds
received by the Demand Shareholders from such offering.

 

Section 6.5 _Registration Expenses_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all expenses incidental to the Companys performance of or

all registration and filing fees (including (A) with respect to filings
required to be made with the SEC, all applicable securities exchanges and/or
FINRA and (B) compliance with securities or blue sky laws including any fees
and disbursements of counsel for the underwriter(s) in connection with blue

(ii) word processing, duplicating and printing expenses (including expenses of
printing certificates for Registrable Shares in a form eligible for deposit
with The Depository Trust Company and of printing Prospectuses, if the
printing of Prospectuses is requested by the managing underwriter(s), if any,
or by the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders); (iii)
messenger, telephone and delivery expenses; (iv) fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company; and (v) fees and disbursements of all independent
certified public accountants (including, without limitation, the fees and
disbursements in connection with any "cold comfort" letters required by this
Agreement), other special experts, retained by the Company, shall be borne by
the Company. The Company shall, in any event, pay its internal expenses, the
expenses of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expenses of
any liability insurance, the expenses and fees for listing the Registrable
Shares to be registered on the applicable securities exchange. All
underwriting discounts, selling commissions and transfer taxes (collectively,
"Selling Expenses") incurred in connection with the offering of any
Registrable Shares shall be borne by the Demand Shareholders. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not bear any Selling Expenses in
connection with its obligations under this Agreement. All expenses incurred
in connection with any "road shows" undertaken pursuant to _Section 6.4(n)_
shall be borne in equal proportion by the Demand Shareholders, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand. 

(b) The Company shall not, however, be required to pay Registration Expenses
for any Demand Registration begun pursuant to  _Section 6.1(a)_, _Section
6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(e)_, the request of which has been subsequently
withdrawn by the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders,
unless the withdrawal is (i) requested under the circumstances described in
_Section 6.1(f)_; or (ii) based upon (A) any fact, circumstance, event,
change, effect or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate with all
other facts or circumstances, events, changes, effects or occurrences has a
material adverse effect on the Company or (B) material adverse information
concerning the Company that the Company had not publicly disclosed at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior to such registration request or that the Company
had not otherwise notified, in writing, the Original Shareholder, on behalf of
the Demand Shareholders, of at the time of such request.

 



A-34 Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Contribution_. (a) The Company shall, and it
hereby agrees to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Demand Shareholder
(but not, pursuant to this _Section 6.6_, any Shareholder Designee in his or
her capacity as a Director), and each underwriter in any offering or sale of
Registrable Shares, and its and their respective Representatives and
Controlling Persons, if any, from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or
threatened) in respect thereof and expenses (including reasonable fees of
counsel) (collectively, "Claims") to which each such indemnified party may
become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in
settlement reached in accordance with the requirements for consent as
provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, arise out of
or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, or any preliminary or
final Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into
such Registration Statement) contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or arise out of or
are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of any preliminary or final Prospectus (including any Free
Writing Prospectus incorporated into such Registration Statement), in light
of the circumstances in which they were made), not misleading; and (ii)
reimburse periodically upon demand such indemnified party for any legal or
other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such Claims; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be liable to any such indemnified party
in any such case to the extent that any such Claims arise out of or are based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such Registration Statement, or preliminary or final
Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such
Registration Statement), or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a
Demand Shareholder or any Representative of a Demand Shareholder expressly for
use therein, or if a Demand Shareholder sold securities to the Person
alleging such Claims without sending or giving, at or prior to the written
confirmation of such sale, a copy of the applicable Prospectus (excluding any
documents incorporated by reference therein) or of the applicable Prospectus,
as then amended or supplemented (excluding any documents incorporated by
reference therein), if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to
the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, and
such Prospectus corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement.

 

(b) Each Demand Shareholder shall, and hereby agrees to, (i) indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and each underwriter in any offering or sale of
Registrable Shares, and its and their respective Representatives and
Controlling Persons, if any, from and against any Claims to which each such
indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any
amounts paid in settlement reached in accordance with the requirements for
consent as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof,
arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, or any
preliminary or final Prospectus (including any Free Writing Prospectus
incorporated into such Registration Statement) contained therein, or any
amendment

 



A-35  or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or
arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary or final Prospectus
(including any Free Writing Prospectus incorporated into such Registration
Statement), in light of the circumstances in which they were made), not
misleading; and (ii) reimburse periodically upon demand such indemnified party
for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
Claims, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and
in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a Demand
Shareholder or any Representative of a Demand Shareholder, expressly for use
therein, or if a Demand Shareholder sold securities to the Person alleging
such Claims without sending or giving, at or prior to the written confirmation
of such sale, a copy of the applicable Prospectus (excluding any documents
incorporated by reference therein) or of the applicable Prospectus, as then
amended or supplemented (excluding any documents incorporated by reference
therein), if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the
Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, and such
Prospectus corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the liability of the Demand Shareholders hereunder shall
be limited to an amount equal to the dollar amount of the net proceeds
received by the Demand Shareholders from Shareholder Shares sold by the Demand
Shareholders pursuant to such Registration Statement or Prospectus.

(c) Each Demand Shareholder and the Company agree that if, for any reason,
the indemnification provisions contemplated by _Section 6.6(a)_ or _Section
6.6(b)_ are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to
statements or omissions that that resulted in such Claims. The relative fault
of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by
such indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. If, however, the allocation in the first sentence of this _Section
6.6(c)_ is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults, but
also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The Parties
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to
this _Section 6.6(c)_ were to be determined by _pro_ _rata_ allocation or by
any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this _Section
6.6(c)_. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the
Claims referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.7_) any legal or other fees or expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not

 



A-36  guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Demand Shareholders shall not be liable to contribute any amount in excess
of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by the Demand Shareholders
from Shareholder Shares sold by the Demand Shareholders pursuant to such
Registration Statement or Prospectus.

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) If an indemnified party shall
desire to assert any claim for indemnification provided for under _Section
6.6_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a Claim against the
indemnified party, such indemnified party shall notify the Company or the
Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, as the case may
be (the "Indemnifying Party"), in writing of such Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Claim),
any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating
thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto (a "Claim Notice") promptly after receipt by such indemnified party
of written notice of the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
provide a Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the indemnified
partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to provide any such copies shall not affect the
indemnification obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

(b) If a Claim is made against an indemnified party, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses
and acknowledges without reservation its obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with separate
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the
indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the Claim involves
potential conflicts of interest or substantially different defenses for the
indemnified party and the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense
(except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party
for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof and as otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding
sentences. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Claim, the
indemnified party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Claim, and the indemnified party shall
use reasonable endeavors to make employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense of a Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability
with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may pay, settle or

 



A-37  compromise a Claim without the written consent of the indemnified party, so
long as such settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability in respect of such Claim; (ii) does not
subject the indemnified party to any injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy; and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

Section 6.8 _Shelf Takedown_. (a) At any time that a Shelf Registration
Statement covering Registrable Shares is effective, if the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, delivers notice (a "Take-
Down Notice") to the Company stating that the Shareholders intend to effect an
underwritten offering of all or part of the Registrable Shares included on
the Shelf Registration Statement (a "Shelf Underwritten Offering"), the
Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement or related
Prospectus as may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable Shares to
be distributed pursuant to the Shelf Underwritten Offering; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand
Shareholders, shall not be entitled to deliver an aggregate of more than
three (3) Take-Down Notices in any twelve (12) month period and the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, may not deliver any Take-
Down Notice within thirty (30) days after the effective date of
any Registration Statement hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, a Shelf
Underwritten Offering shall count against the limit set forth in _Section
6.1(b)_.

 

(b) In connection with any Shelf Underwritten Offering, in the event that the
managing underwriter advises the Company and the Original Shareholder, on
behalf of the Demand Shareholders, in writing that, in its good faith opinion,
the total number or dollar amount of Registrable Shares requested by the
Shareholder to be included therein exceeds the largest number or dollar amount
of Registrable Shares that can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on
the per share offering price), the Company shall include in such registration
or prospectus only such number of Registrable Shares that in the good faith
opinion of such underwriter(s) can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on
the per share offering price).

 

Section 6.9 _Rule 144; Rule 144A_. The Company covenants that it will use its
reasonable endeavors to timely file the reports required to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC thereunder, and to take such further action as the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, may reasonably request,
all to the extent required from time to time to enable the Demand Shareholders
to sell Registrable Shares without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 or Rule 144A
or Regulation S under the Securities Act; or (ii) any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of the Original
Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, the Company will deliver
to the Original Shareholder, on behalf of the Demand Shareholders, a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not,
the specifics thereof.

 

Section 6.10 _Holdback_. In consideration for the Company agreeing to its
obligations under this Agreement, each Demand Shareholder agrees, in
connection with any underwritten offering made pursuant to a Registration
Statement in which such Demand Shareholder has elected to include Registrable
Shares, upon the written request of the managing 

 



A-38  underwriter(s) of such offering, not to effect (other than pursuant to such
underwritten offering) any public sale or distribution of Registrable Shares,
including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A, or make any short sale
of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise Transfer (other
than to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with _Section 5.1(f)(i)_, any
Registrable Shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any other securities of the Company without the prior written
consent of the managing underwriter(s) during the Holdback Period. The Company
agrees that each such Shareholder shall only be bound so long as and to the
extent that each other shareholder seeking to exercise registration rights
with respect to such offering is similarly bound; _provided_ that a request
under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be effective more than once in any
twelve (12) month period.

ARTICLE VII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. Except with respect to the obligations set forth in
_Section 3.2_, _Section 6.6_, and  _Section 6.7_, which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect upon the later of (a) the tenth (10th) anniversary of
the Closing Date; and (b) the date that is three (3) years after the first
date on which the Shareholders shall cease to Beneficially Own, in the
aggregate, Voting Securities representing at least the Ownership Threshold.

 

Section 7.2 _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party acknowledges that it would be
impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would be
inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the other Parties shall, in addition
to any other rights or remedies which they may have, be entitled to such
equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
Party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action
or proceeding for injunctive relief, each Party hereto hereby waives the claim
or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this Agreement
specifically enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or
other security against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief
against it enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of
such provisions of this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Assignments_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as contemplated by _Section 5.1(f)_, none of the Parties may
directly or indirectly assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of, in the
case of each Shareholder, the Company, and in the case of the Company, the
Original Shareholder. Any purported direct or indirect assignment in violation
of this _Section 7.3_ shall be null and void _ab_ _initio_.

Section 7.4 _Amendments; Waiver_. No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set
forth in writing and duly executed by (i) the Company, where enforcement of
the amendment, modification,

 



A-39  discharge or waiver is sought against the Company; or (ii) the Original
Shareholder, where enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or
waiver is sought against a Shareholder. Any such waiver shall constitute a
waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. The waiver by the Company, on the one
hand, or the Original Shareholder, on the other hand, of a breach of or a
default under any of the provisions of this Agreement or the failure to
exercise or delay in exercising any right or privilege hereunder, shall not
be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature,
or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The
rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of
any other, or of any rights or remedies that any Party may otherwise have at
law or in equity.

Section 7.5 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to
be given hereunder by any Party to the others shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given to a Party when (i) delivered to the appropriate address by hand

HEREBY.

Section 7.7 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and headings herein are
for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement

hereof. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting

or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the
provisions of this Agreement and the articles of association of the Company,
the terms of this agreement shall prevail.

 

Section 7.8 _Entire Agreement; No Other Representations_. Except for the

Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings representations and warranties both written and
oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



A-41 Section 7.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as explicitly provided for

provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Affiliates shall not bring any suit or action against Cosmo or its Affiliates
claiming that the performance by Cosmo or its Affiliates of any obligations

has reasonable (under the circumstances) time to review and comment upon any
documents intended for submission to any

 



33  patent office; (ii) furnish to the other Party a copy of any such Joint
Patent application and copies of documents relevant to such prosecution and
maintenance, including copies of correspondence with any patent office,

any patent office; and (iii) reasonably consider the comments timely provided
by the other Party on any such documents filed with any patent office,
including any comments from the other Party regarding steps to be taken

costs in respect of the preparation, prosecution or maintenance of such Joint
Patent, and such assigned Joint Patent shall not be included in the Salix

given claim under this Section 8.5 shall also have the right to control
settlement of such claim; _provided_ , that no settlement shall be entered

any new obligations or adversely affect any obligations of the non-controlling
Party under this Agreement, or adversely affect the validity or enforceability
of any Covered Patent, Foreign Equivalent Patent, Joint Patent, Cosmo
Licensed Patent or Salix Licensed Patent.

(c) Information; Assistance. Each Party shall provide to the other Party all
reasonable assistance requested by the other Party in connection with any
action, claim or suit under this Section 8.5, at the requesting Partys
expense, including (to the extent consistent with the preservation of
attorney-client or attorney work product privilege) allowing such other Party
access to the assisting Partys files and documents and to the assisting
Partys

 



36 personnel who may have possession of relevant information. In particular, the
assisting Party shall promptly make available to the other Party all
information in its possession or control that it is aware shall assist the

counterclaim asserted under Section 8.5, or in a declaratory judgment action
or similar action or claim filed by such Third Party, in either case that any
Covered Patent, Foreign Equivalent Patent, Joint Patent, Cosmo Licensed
Patent or Salix Licensed Patent is invalid or unenforceable, then the Party
pursuing such infringement action, or the Party first obtaining knowledge of
such declaratory judgment action, as the case may be, shall promptly give
written notice to the other Party.

(i) Where such assertion is made as a defense or as a counterclaim in any
infringement action under Section 8.4, the Party controlling such
infringement action under Section 8.4 shall have the right to defend against
such action or claim.

similar action or claim, the Party controlling the prosecution of the
applicable Patent pursuant to Section 8.3 shall have the right to defend such
action.

given claim under this Section 8.6 shall also have the right to control

of any Covered Patent, Foreign Equivalent Patent, Joint Patent, Cosmo

Salix Territory or the applicable Cosmo Territory that refers to or relies on
Regulatory Documentation submitted by either Party to any Regulatory
Authority, whether or not such a filing may infringe a Covered Patent,
Foreign Equivalent Patent, Cosmo Licensed Patent, Salix Licensed Patent or
Joint Patent, (ii) receives any notice of certification regarding such Patents
pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act claiming that any such Patents are invalid or
unenforceable or claiming that the any such Patents will not be infringed by
the manufacture, use, marketing or sale of a product for which an MAA is

limit the assignment, license, sale or transfer of any Mesalamine Patent or
any Mesalamine Agreement between or among Salix and its Affiliates.

10.6 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 

ARTICLE 11

 

CONFIDENTIALITY

11.1 Nondisclosure and Non-Use. Each Party agrees that during the Term, and
for a period of seven (7) years following termination or expiration hereof, it
will keep confidential, and will cause its employees, agent,
consultants, licensees and sublicensees to keep

 



43  confidential, all Confidential Information of the other Party that is
disclosed to it, or to any of its employees, agents, consultants, licensees or
sublicensees pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, whether before
or after the Effective Date, except to the extent that disclosure is required
or permitted in accordance with the performance of this Agreement. Neither
Party nor any of its employees, agents, consultants, licensees
or sublicensees shall use Confidential Information of the other Party for any
purpose except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or except as expressly
authorized by the disclosing Party. Each Party covenants that each of its
employees, agents, consultants, licensees and sublicensees who shall have
access to Confidential Information of the other Party are bound by written
obligations to maintain such information in confidence and not to use such
information except as expressly permitted herein.

11.2 Permitted Disclosures. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information
to the extent that such disclosure is: 

(a) in response to a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other
governmental authority or, if in the reasonable opinion of the receiving
Partys legal counsel, such disclosure is otherwise required by Applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the receiving Party shall first have given notice to
the disclosing Party and given the disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity
to quash such order or to obtain a protective order or confidential treatment
requiring that the Confidential Information and documents that are the subject
of such order or requirement be held in confidence by such court or agency
or, if disclosed, be used only for the purposes for which the order was
issued; _provided, further_ , that the Confidential Information disclosed in
response to such court or governmental order or Applicable Law shall be
limited to that information which is legally required to be disclosed in
response to such court or governmental order or Applicable Law to request
confidential treatment thereof;

 

(b) solely to the extent reasonably necessary in a Patent application
permitted to be filed hereunder with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or any similar foreign agency; _provided_ , that the Party filing the
Patent application shall provide at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice of such disclosure to the other Party and take reasonable and
lawful actions to avoid or minimize the degree of disclosure; or

(c) to a Regulatory Authority, as reasonably required or useful in
connection with any filing, submission or communication with respect to any
Covered Product; _provided_ , that reasonable measures shall be taken to
assure confidential treatment of such information, to the extent such
protection is available.

 

11.3 Scientific Publications and Presentations. Each Party shall have the
right to review and comment on any paper, oral presentations and abstracts,
proposed for publication by the other Party or, subject to the publication
policies of applicable academic institutions, Third Parties in respect of
which such Party can exert control over publications which utilizes Clinical
Data or other data or results generated from any studies performed hereunder
or otherwise in respect of the Covered Products or that includes any
Confidential Information of the other Party. Before any such paper is
submitted for publication, the Party proposing publication shall deliver a
complete copy to the other Party at least forty-five (45) days prior to
submitting the paper to a publisher. The receiving Party shall review any such
paper and give its comments to the publishing Party within thirty (30) days
of the delivery of

 



44  such paper to the receiving Party. With respect to oral presentation
materials and abstracts, the Parties shall make reasonable efforts to expedite
review of such materials and abstracts, and shall return such items as soon
as practicable to the publishing Party with appropriate comments, if any, in
an expedited manner, but in no event later than ten (10) days (or such shorter
period as the Parties may agree in good faith in exigent circumstances) from
the date of delivery to the receiving Party. The publishing Party shall comply
with the other Partys request to delete references to such other Party or
such Partys Confidential Information in any such paper, oral presentation or
abstract and, if the reviewing Party identifies patentable inventions, shall
withhold publication of same for an additional sixty (60) days in order to
permit the Parties to obtain patent protection in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, if either of the Parties deem it necessary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may make an oral presentation that
was previously approved by the other Party without again submitting such
presentation for review by the other Party.

11.4 Terms of this Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Article 11, without the prior consent of the other Party, neither Party
shall disclose any terms or conditions of this Agreement (including any
Exhibit) to any Third Party nor make any statement to the public (including
any press release) regarding the execution or any other aspect of the subject
matter of this Agreement (including the Development or Commercialization
status of any Covered Product), except: (a) to the extent such disclosure is
required by Applicable Law or stock exchange rules or regulations and, to the
extent practical, the other Party is provided with the opportunity
sufficiently in advance of disclosure to review such information and seek
confidential treatment therefor; (b) for customary discussions and other
disclosures with and to shareholders, current or prospective investors,
potential acquirers, potential licensees, merger partners or potential
providers of financing and their advisors; or (c) either Party may use the
text of a statement previously approved by the other Party. With respect to
any disclosures made pursuant to subsection (b) above, each such Third Party
recipient of Confidential Information shall be subject to obligations of
confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information
substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and non-use of the
receiving Party pursuant to this Article 11.

 

11.5 Study Subject Information. The Parties agree to abide, and to take all
reasonable and appropriate actions to ensure that all Third Parties
(including licensees and sublicensees) conducting or assisting with any
clinical development activities with respect to Covered Products shall, in
such conduct or assistance, abide by all Applicable Law relating to the
confidentiality or protection of patient identifiable information or
patients protected health information, including the regulations at 45 C.F.R.
Parts 160 and 164 and where relevant, the applicable national laws
implementing the European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and

except, in each case ((a) and (b)), for those Losses for which Cosmo has an
obligation to indemnify Salix pursuant to Section 12.2 hereof, as to which
Losses each Party shall indemnify the other to the extent of their respective
responsibility for the Losses.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary,
Salix shall have no liability for, and Cosmo shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Salix Indemnitees, from and against, any and all Losses, whenever
asserted, arising out of or relating to any contract, license, agreement,
arrangement, claim or understanding (whether written or oral) existing as of
the Effective Date to which Cosmo, Salix, or any of their respective

assignment, transfer, licensing, sale, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, or
other disposition, or any Exploitation of any Covered Product, Covered Patent,
Mesalamine Patent, Mesalamine Product or MMX Patent.

 

12.2 Indemnification of Salix by Cosmo. Cosmo shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Salix and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (collectively, the " _Salix Indemnitees_ ") from and
against any and all Losses:

 

(a) arising out of any Third Party Claim against any Salix Indemnitee to the
extent resulting directly or indirectly from:

 

(i) the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of Cosmo or its

obligation to indemnify Cosmo pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof, as to
which Losses each Party shall indemnify the other to the extent of their
respective responsibility for the Losses.

12.3 Indemnification Procedure.

(a) Notice. A Cosmo Indemnitee or Salix Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ")
shall promptly notify the indemnifying Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") of any
Losses or discovery of facts in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to
seek such indemnification. No delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying
the Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder
unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is prejudiced
thereby.

 

(b) Control of Third Party Claims. The Indemnitor shall have the right,
exercisable by notice to the Indemnitee within ten (10) business days of
receipt of notice from the Indemnitee of the commencement of or assertion of
any Third Party Claim, to assume direction and control of the defense,
litigation, settlement, appeal or other disposition of the Third Party Claim
(including the right to settle the Third Party Claim solely for monetary
consideration) with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee. During such time as the Indemnitor is
controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall
cooperate, and cause its Affiliates, agents, licensees and sublicensees to
cooperate upon request of the Indemnitor in the defense or prosecution of the
Third Party Claim, including by furnishing such records, information and
testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnitor. If the
Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee of the Indemnitors intent to
defend any Third Party Claim within ten (10) business days after notice
thereof, the Indemnitee may undertake the defense thereof with counsel of its
choice upon notice to the Indemnitor and at the Indemnitors reasonable
expense (including reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys fees and costs and
expenses of enforcement or defense). The Indemnitor or the Indemnitee, as the
case may be, shall have the right to join in (including the right to conduct
discovery, interview and examine witnesses and participate in all settlement
conferences), but not control, at its own expense, the defense of any Third
Party Claim that the other Party is defending as provided in this Agreement.

 



47 (c) Settlement. The Indemnitor shall obtain the prior consent of any
Indemnitee as to any settlement that would materially diminish or materially
adversely affect the scope, exclusivity or duration of any Patents licensed
under this Agreement, would require any payment by such Indemnitee, would
require an admission of legal wrongdoing in any way on the part of an
Indemnitee or would effect an amendment of this Agreement. In no event may an
Indemnitee settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for which it intends to
seek indemnification from the Indemnitor hereunder without the prior consent
of the Indemnitor, or the indemnification provided under such this Article 12
as to such Third Party Claim shall be null and void.

 

12.4 Insurance. Each Party shall maintain adequate liability insurance
coverage or adequately plan through self-insurance for its liabilities
associated with its activities and obligations under this Agreement in such
amounts and on such terms as are customary for prudent practices in the
pharmaceutical industry for the activities to be conducted by it under this
Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other Party evidence of such
insurance, upon request.

12.5 No Duplication of Recovery. Subject to Section 9.5(e) of the Merger
Agreement, the indemnification hereunder shall not derogate from the
indemnification provided under Articles VII and IX of the Merger Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 13

TERM; TERMINATION

13.1 Term. This Agreement shall take effect as of the Effective Date and,
unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 13.2, shall expire upon the
expiration of the last Valid Claim of a Covered Patent, Foreign Equivalent
Patent, Joint Patent (but excluding the PCT 838 Patent), Cosmo Licensed
Patent or Salix Licensed Patent covering the Covered Products anywhere in the
world or the earlier worldwide withdrawal of all Covered Products from the
market (the " _Term_ "). The following provisions will survive expiration of
the Term: Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 6.3, 8.1,
8.2, 8.3(d), 8.5, 8.9, and 13.1 and Articles 9, 11, 12 and 14.

13.2 Termination by Mutual Agreement. In the event both Parties desire to
terminate this Agreement in its entirety, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith and enter into a termination agreement setting forth the Parties
respective rights and obligations with respect to the Joint Technology and
Covered Products after such termination, and any such termination shall only
be effective upon the Parties agreement on and execution of such termination
agreement.

 

13.3 Rights in Bankruptcy. All rights and licenses granted under or pursuant
to this Agreement by Salix or Cosmo are and shall otherwise be deemed to be,
for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any analogous
provisions in any other country or jurisdiction, licenses of right to
"intellectual property" as defined under Section 101 of the U.S. 

 



48 Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that the Parties, as licensees of such
rights under this Agreement, shall retain and may fully exercise all of their
rights and elections under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any analogous
provisions in any other country or jurisdiction. The Parties further agree
that, in the event of the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding by or
against either Party under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any analogous
provisions in any other country or jurisdiction, the Party hereto that is not
a Party to such proceeding shall be entitled to a complete duplicate of (or
complete access to, as appropriate) any such intellectual property and all
embodiments of such intellectual property, which, if not already in the non-
subject Partys possession, shall be promptly delivered to it (a) upon any
such commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding upon the non-subject Partys
written request therefor, unless the Party subject to such proceeding elects
to continue to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement or (b) if
not delivered under clause (a) above, following the rejection of this
Agreement by or on behalf of the Party subject to such proceeding upon written
request therefor by the non-subject Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that payments made pursuant to the Supply Agreements shall not (x) constitute
royalties within the meaning of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
any analogous provisions in any other country or jurisdiction or (y) relate to
licenses of intellectual property hereunder.

13.4 Remedies Other Than Termination. Neither Party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement, in part or in its entirety, for any reason. It is
the Parties intent to provide relief or compensation to either Party
hereunder in the event of the other Partys material breach of any material
provision of this Agreement, not through the termination of this Agreement
but through remedies in law or equity, such as injunctive relief, specific
performance, and monetary damages.

13.5 Competitor Change in Control.

(a) Cosmo Change in Control. If Cosmo undergoes a Competitor Change in
Control, then Cosmo (or its successor) shall provide Salix with written
notice of such transaction within five (5) days following the closing date of
such transaction and Salix shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by
written notice delivered to Cosmo (or its successor) at any time within six
(6) months following receipt of the written notice delivered by Cosmo (or its
successor), (i) to terminate the provisions of Article 3 and Sections 4.3(a)

respect of any information required by Cosmo to maintain Regulatory Approvals
in the applicable Cosmo Territory), 5.4 (except for any notifications or
information directly relevant to the Development or Commercialization by
Cosmo of the Covered Products in the applicable Cosmo Territory), and 6.2(a)
(except for the provision of Product Labeling or Promotional Materials
relevant to the Development or Commercialization by Cosmo of the
Covered Products in the applicable Cosmo Territory), in each case insofar as
such provision relates to information to be provided by Salix to Cosmo, and
(ii) to disband the Joint Development Committee and terminate its activities
and thereafter undertake all activities and make all determinations assigned
by this Agreement to the Joint Development Committee solely and exclusively by
itself.

 

(b) Salix Change in Control. If Salix undergoes a Competitor Change in
Control, then Salix (or its successor) shall provide Cosmo with written
notice of such transaction within five (5) days following the closing date of
such transaction and Cosmo shall

 



49  have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice delivered to Salix
(or its successor) at any time within six (6) months following the written
notice delivered by Salix (or its successor), (i) to terminate the provisions
of Article 3 and Sections 4.3(a) and (b), 4.5 (solely to the extent of Cosmos
obligations), 5.1(a) (except in respect of any information required by Salix
to maintain Regulatory Approvals in the applicable Salix Territory), 5.4
(except for any notifications or information directly relevant to the
Development or Commercialization by Salix of the Covered Products in the

the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings, promises
and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are
superseded hereby. Each Party confirms that it is not relying on any

Agreement.

 

14.5 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions hereof shall inure to
the benefit of, and be binding upon, Salix, Cosmo and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

14.6 Dispute Resolution. In the event of a dispute between the
Parties, either Party may, by giving written notice of dispute to the other
Party, request a meeting of authorized representatives of the Parties for the
purpose of resolving the dispute. The Parties agree that, within thirty (30)
days after any such request, each Party shall designate a representative to
participate in dispute resolution discussions that shall be held at a mutually
acceptable time and place for the purpose of resolving the dispute. Each Party
agrees to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute in a mutually
acceptable manner. If for whatever reason the Parties are unable to resolve
the dispute within sixty (60) days after the issuance of a notice of dispute,
then either Party may, by written notice to the other Party, submit the
dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 14.6.

(a) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the
breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce as then in effect (" _ICC Rules_ ");
_provided_ , that in the event and to the extent such rules conflict with the
terms of this Section 14.6, the terms of this Section 14.6 shall govern.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be Dublin,
Ireland. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 14.6(c), the arbitration shall be held
before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected by agreement of the
Parties, or, if the Parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after
commencement of arbitration, then by the International Chamber of Commerce ("
_ICC_ "). The arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 14.6(b) shall be a
practicing or retired lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible,
have experience relating to agreements concerning the global development and
commercialization of pharmaceutical products.

 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 14.6(b), in the event that the dispute that is
subject to arbitration is one in which a Party seeks to recover an amount of
at least one million Dollars ($1,000,000) from the other Party, then either
Party shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to the other Party
given at any time within ten (10) days after commencement of arbitration, to
require that the arbitration be held before a panel of three (3) arbitrators.
In such

 



52  case, within thirty (30) days after the provision of notice described in the
preceding sentence, each Party shall select one person to act as arbitrator.
If a Party shall fail within the designated time period to select an
arbitrator, then the arbitrator to be selected by the Party shall be selected
by the ICC. The two (2) persons so selected as arbitrators shall select a
third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment. If the two (2)
initially selected arbitrators are unable or fail to agree upon the third
arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the ICC. Each arbitrator
selected pursuant to this Section 14.6(c) shall be a practicing lawyer or
retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience relating to
agreements concerning the global development and commercialization of
pharmaceutical products.

 

(d) Each Party shall, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly
provide the other Party with copies of documents relevant to the issues
raised by the dispute on which the producing Party may rely in support of, or
in opposition to, any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or
the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator(s),
which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed
within forty five (45) days following the appointment of the arbitrator(s).

 

(e) It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances,
arbitration proceedings will be concluded within six (6) months from the date
the arbitrator is appointed (or, where a panel of three (3) arbitrators is
used, the date upon which the third arbitrator is appointed). The
arbitrator(s) may extend this time limit in the interests of justice. Failure
to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the
award.

(f) Except as may be required by Applicable Law (including applicable
securities laws or rules of a securities exchange) or as may be necessary to
enforce the arbitration award or the provisions of this Section 14.6, and
except for disclosures made by a Party to its accountants, insurers,
consultants, or attorneys or to actual or potential lenders, non-public
investors, rating agencies, acquirors, or business partners who are under
obligations to the disclosing Party to hold the disclosed information in
confidence, neither a Party nor its representatives may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

 

(g) The arbitrator(s) shall have discretion to allocate the Parties costs and
expenses for the arbitration (including attorneys fees), the fees of the
arbitrator(s), and the administrative fees of arbitration between the Parties
in proportion to the extent to which they prevail. Failing such allocation,
each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the
fees of the arbitrators and administrative fees of the arbitration.

14.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of Ireland, excluding any conflicts or choice of law
rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of
this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.

 

14.8 Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as giving any Person, other than the Parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

 



53 14.9 Export Control. This Agreement is made subject to any
restrictions concerning the export of products or technical information from
the United States or other countries that may be imposed on the Parties from
time to time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or
indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other Party under
this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location
or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export license or other
governmental approval, without first obtaining the written consent to do so
from the appropriate agency or other governmental entity in accordance with
Applicable Law.

14.10 Assignment.

(a) Without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, neither Party shall
sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of, whether voluntarily,
involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any of its
rights or duties hereunder; _provided_ , that either Party may assign or
transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the consent of the other Party (i) to any Majority-Controlled Affiliate of
such Party; _provided_ , that (A) the assigning Party remains jointly and
severally liable under this Agreement with such Majority-Controlled Affiliate
and (B) any subsequent transaction (other than one that would result in the
assignment or transfer of this Agreement back to the assigning Party) that
would cause such Majority-Controlled Affiliate to cease to be a Majority-
Controlled Affiliate of such Party shall be deemed to be an assignment of this
Agreement requiring the prior written consent of the other Party; or (ii) to
any Third Party with which it merges or consolidates, or to which it
transfers all or substantially all of its assets relating to the Exploitation
of Covered Products; _provided_ , that (1) the Third Party successor assumes

and all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this

rights or remedies to which such non-breaching Party may be entitled in law or
equity. Both Parties agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by

security as a condition for obtaining any such relief and (b) show irreparable
harm, balancing of harms, consideration of the public interest or inadequacy

Article 11. Each Party shall remain solely responsible for all costs and
expenses associated with its use of subcontractor(s) hereunder.

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges that certain of the other Partys
obligations under this Agreement may be performed by Affiliates of such other
Party. Each of the Parties guarantees performance of this Agreement by any of
its Affiliates.

(a) All payments to be made by one Party to the other Party (the " _Payee_ ")
under this Agreement shall be paid by bank wire transfer or by automated
clearinghouse (electronic funds transfer) in immediately available funds to
such bank account designated in writing by the Payee from time to time. Time
for payment shall be of the essence. Unless the paying Party notifies the
Payee in writing of a good faith dispute with respect to amounts not paid when
due, interest shall accrue thereon at the rate of prime plus one percent (1%),
such interest to begin accruing on a daily basis from the date payment is
due;  _provided_ , that in the case of a good faith dispute regarding payment
that is resolved to be due and is not paid within three (3) business days
after such resolution, interest shall accrue on any amount overdue at the rate
of prime plus one percent (1%), such interest to begin accruing on a daily
basis from the date such payment becomes overdue. For purposes of this
Agreement, the rate of prime shall be that rate of prime quoted by Citibank,
N.A., New York, New York, or any successor entity thereto.

(b) All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or
withholding for or on account of any taxes, duties, levies, or other charges

assessed against the Payee. The paying Party shall consult in good faith with
the Payee (whose fees shall be borne solely by the Payee) prior to deducting
or withholding any amounts as aforesaid. If the paying Party is so required to
make any deduction or withholding from payments due to the Payee, the paying
Party shall (i) promptly notify the Payee of such requirement, (ii) pay to
the relevant authorities on Payees behalf the full amount required to be
deducted or withheld promptly upon the earlier of determining that such
deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount
has been assessed against the Payee, and (iii) promptly forward to Payee an
official receipt (or certified copy) or other documentation reasonably
acceptable to Payee evidencing such payment to such authorities.

 

(c) All payments under this Agreement shall be made in United States dollars.
Any amount or charge necessary for determining any amount payable hereunder
that is received or incurred in a currency other than United States dollars
shall be translated into United States dollars at the average daily purchase
price for United States dollars using the relevant currency during the
most recently ended Quarter prior to the date of the relevant transaction,
using for such purpose daily purchase prices as reported in the _Wall Street
Journal_ as published for the New York City market.

9 (c) Without duplication of any previously delivered Purchase Order, each Firm
Forecast shall be accompanied by a Purchase Order for Product to be delivered
to Salix during each of the first three (3) months, respectively, set forth in

eighty percent (80%) or more than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the
quantities specified in the most recent Firm Forecast applicable to such
month. __

(d) Cosmo shall promptly acknowledge its receipt of each Purchase Order. With
respect to each Purchase Order, Salix shall be obligated to purchase, and

Materials and obtaining supplies of Materials in accordance with the
Specifications. All Materials shall conform to the applicable specifications
or Drug Master File, as further referenced in regulatory documentation owned
or filed by or on behalf of Salix in respect of any Product.

prepare and send to Cosmo a report stating (i) the calculation of the Average
Actual Price for such Calendar Year; (ii) the total amount of Estimated Price
actually paid or payable by Salix to Cosmo for the delivery of Commercial
Units to Salix in such Calendar Year; and (ii) the amount of the

the calculations in subclauses (i) and (ii) above, such that after such
Reconciliation Payment (by the appropriate Party to the other) Salix has paid
to Cosmo the total Average Actual Price for each Commercial Unit purchased by
Salix hereunder in such Calendar Year. Within fifteen (15) days of Cosmos
receipt of such report from Salix, the applicable Party shall pay to the other

believe that it will be unable to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section
2.3(a) or supply Salix, in a timely manner and in conformity with the
warranties set forth in Section 2.9, with the full quantity of Product
forecasted to be ordered or actually ordered by Salix (whether by reason of
force majeure or otherwise), Cosmo shall, as promptly as possible, notify
Salix thereof (and, in any event, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide at least fifteen (15) days advance notice thereof to
Salix). Promptly thereafter, the Parties shall meet to discuss and Cosmo
shall use best efforts to provide and satisfy Salix with the full quantity of
conforming Product or maintenance of the required inventory. Compliance by
Cosmo with this Section 2.10(a) shall not relieve Cosmo of any other
obligation or liability under this Agreement, including any obligation or
liability under Section 2.10(b), (c) or (d).

 

(b) If Cosmo fails to deliver the full quantity of Product specified in a
Purchase Order (other than as a result of Salixs failure to comply with its
release obligations in accordance with the timeline set forth in the Quality
Agreement) by fifteen (15) days after the required delivery date specified
therein and in conformity with the warranties set forth in Section 2.9, then
Salix may, at its option, (i) cancel all or any portion of such Purchase
Order, in which event Salix shall have no liability with respect to the
portion of such Purchase Order so cancelled, or (ii) accept late delivery of
all or any portion of the Product specified in such Purchase Order.

the aggregate amount of Product (together with equivalent versions of the
Product Manufactured for sale outside the Territory) available for delivery by

to the warranties set forth in Section 2.9, Salix shall give Cosmo notice
thereof (including a sample of such Product, if applicable). Cosmo shall
undertake appropriate evaluation of such sample and shall notify Salix whether
it has confirmed such nonconformity within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice from Salix. If Cosmo notifies Salix that it has not confirmed
such nonconformity, then the Parties shall submit the dispute to an
independent testing laboratory or other appropriate expert mutually acceptable
to the Parties (the "Testing Laboratory") for evaluation. Both Parties shall
cooperate with the Testing Laboratorys reasonable requests for assistance in
connection with its evaluation hereunder. The findings of the Testing

expenses of the Testing Laboratory shall be borne by Cosmo if the testing
confirms the nonconformity and otherwise by Salix. If the Testing Laboratory
or Cosmo confirms that the Product does not conform to the warranties set

to be obtained in connection with such facility and its operation and
equipment used or to be used in the Manufacture of the Products (such
facility, once all such licenses, registrations and approvals have been
obtained, the "Secondary Facility"). The Secondary Facility shall be a
facility owned by Cosmo. Once the Secondary Facility has been established and
qualified in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall discuss
and agree in good faith how the Capacity shall be updated to reflect
additional capacity available through the Secondary Facility.

(c) Cosmo shall notify Salix promptly after the fire certificate required by
Applicable Law for the Secondary Facility has been issued. Salix shall pay
Cosmo a milestone in the amount of Twenty-One Million Dollars ($21,000,000)

_provided_ that if the fire certificate is issued prior to December 5, 2014,
Salix shall pay such milestone not later than January 5, 2015.

 

(d) Cosmo agrees that at all times during the Term it will not, unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Salix, allow its Capacity to be less than the
Current Capacity (or any increased capacity subsequently made available

(e) In the event that at any time during the Term Salix contemplates that its
requirements for the Products to be purchased hereunder are likely to exceed
the Current Capacity (or any increased Capacity as of such date), Salix shall
promptly notify Cosmo and the Parties shall thereafter discuss in good faith
plans to increase Cosmos Capacity in respect of the Products so as to meet

Plans"). Cosmo agrees to use its best efforts to implement any mutually agreed
upon Scale-Up Plan in accordance with its terms.

provide Cosmo with appropriate documentation relating to any such changes to
the Specifications, Manufacturing process or test methods to the extent that
such changes affect Cosmos Manufacturing of the applicable Product
hereunder.

Salixs liability for such reimbursement shall be limited to levels of
inventory that are consistent with the most recent Firm Forecast, plus twenty
percent (20%).

expenses incurred by it or Salix as a result of any amendment of
the Specifications, the Manufacturing process or the test methods for any
Product (i) requested by Cosmo and consented to in writing by Salix as
contemplated by Section 2.13(b)(ii) or (ii) required by Salix as a result of
Cosmos failure to Manufacture the Products in conformity with the warranties
set forth in Section 2.9.

(c) _Capital Expenditures_. If Cosmo reasonably believes that the Manufacture
of (i) a New Product in accordance with the New Product Specifications,
Manufacturing process, and the test methods therefor provided by Salix or (ii)
a Product in accordance with any amendment to the Specifications, the
Manufacturing process, or the test methods for such Product required by Salix,
in either case ((i) or (ii)) would require material capital expenditures for
plant, equipment or process upgrades, the Parties shall, for a period of not
less than thirty (30) days after Salix provides such information, negotiate in
good faith the amount of capital expenditures required and an appropriate
allocation of such capital expenditures between the Parties, taking into
account the expected use by Cosmo of such plant, equipment or process upgrades
to Manufacture products for customers in addition to Salix. If, after such
period, the Parties cannot agree on the amount of such capital expenditures or
the appropriate allocation of such capital expenditures between the Parties,
then the Parties shall submit the dispute to an appropriately qualified expert
of recognized repute and credentials mutually agreed by the Parties, which
expert shall determine the amount of such capital expenditures or the
appropriate allocation of such capital expenditures between the Parties within
thirty (30) days after the dispute is referred to him or her. In the event
that the matter is submitted to an expert in accordance with the foregoing
sentence, the expert shall use such procedures

test methods for any Product, in either case adversely affects Cosmos ability
to maintain its Capacity at the Current Capacity (or any increased capacity as
subsequently made available pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or agreed pursuant to
any Scale-Up Plan), the Parties shall discuss in good faith a Scale-Up Plan to
address such shortfall in Capacity.

Agreement (the "Quality Agreement"). Each Party shall duly and punctually
perform all of its obligations under the Quality Agreement.

 

2.15 _Quality Control Analyses and Release_. Cosmo shall be responsible for
all quality control analyses and quality assurance of the Products;
_provided_ that all Products shall be final released by Salix, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the Quality Agreement. For avoidance of doubt,
such release of Product by Salix shall not limit Salixs rights in respect of
Product that does not comply with the warranty set forth in Section 2.9,
including Salixs right to reject Product pursuant to Section 2.10(e).

 

2.16 _Maintenance of Facilities_.

(b) Cosmo shall at all times during the Term ensure that any and all
licenses, registrations, and Regulatory Authority approvals required by
Applicable Law to be obtained in connection with each Facility and its

Salix as contemplated hereunder have been obtained and are in all respects
current and in full force and effect.

notification thereof by Salix or such longer period as may be agreed by the
Parties.

communication or response not misleading.

 

2.20 _Recalls and Withdrawals_. Cosmo promptly shall reimburse Salix for all
costs incurred by Salix in connection with recalls, market withdrawals, and
returns and destruction of Products as and to the extent such recalls, market

willful misconduct. Salix shall have the right to offset any such costs
against any payments owed by Salix to Cosmo under this Agreement.

2.21  _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Cosmo shall strictly comply, and
shall cause each of its Materials suppliers to strictly comply, with GMP and
all other Applicable Law in carrying out the Manufacturing of the Products and
its other duties and obligations under this Agreement, including those

period as may be required by GMP and all other Applicable Law and (ii) five
(5) years.

2.23 _Right to Obtain Product from Additional Sources in the Event of Serious
Supply Failure_. In the event of a Serious Supply Failure, in addition to any
other remedies available to Salix hereunder, Cosmo shall be required to
establish and qualify a Third Party manufacturing facility not later than
twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of such Serious Supply Failure
(the "Cosmo CMO Deadline") capable of Manufacturing commercial scale
quantities of the Products in accordance with the terms hereof, including by
obtaining all licenses, registrations, and Regulatory Authority approvals
required by Applicable Law to be obtained in connection with such facility and
its operation and equipment used or to be used in the Manufacture of the
Products (the "Cosmo CMO"). If Cosmo has not complied with its obligations to
establish the Cosmo CMO in accordance with the preceding sentence by the Cosmo
CMO Deadline, (a) Salix shall no longer be required to purchase its
requirements of any Product from Cosmo and (b) Salix shall have the right to
enter into arrangements with one or more Third Parties to act as additional

Products, on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis, such licenses, and provide
to such Third Party manufacturer (or Salix or its Affiliate), free of charge,
such technical assistance as such Third Party manufacturer (or Salix or its
Affiliate) may require in order to Manufacture the Products to the then-
current Manufacturing process(es) for the Products.

 

2.24 _Combination Products_. In the event that Salix desires to develop or

ARTICLE VII. INDEMNIFICATION

 

7.1 _Cosmo Indemnification_. Cosmo shall indemnify Salix, its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the
"Salix Indemnified Parties"), and defend and hold each of them harmless, from
and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements)
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by any of them in connection with (a) any
and all suits, actions, investigations, claims or demands of Third Parties
(collectively, all "Third Party Claims") arising from or

 



25  occurring as a result of (i) the breach by Cosmo of any of its
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, (ii) Cosmos breach
of any covenant, undertaking or other term contained in this Agreement, (iii)
Cosmos negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of this Agreement,
or (iv) the storage, release, or disposal of any hazardous or regulated
material or any waste by Cosmo, or (b) the enforcement by Salix of its rights
under this Section 7.1, except, in each case, for those Losses for which Salix
has an obligation to indemnify the Cosmo Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 7.2, as to which Losses each Party shall indemnify the other Party to
the extent of its respective liability for such Losses.

7.2 _Salix Indemnification_. Salix shall indemnify Cosmo, its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the "Cosmo
Indemnified Parties"), and defend and hold each of them harmless, from and
against any and all Losses incurred by any of them in connection with (a) any
and all Third Party Claims arising from or occurring as a result of (i) the
breach by Salix of any of its representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) Salixs breach of any covenant, undertaking or other term
contained in this Agreement, or (b) the enforcement by Cosmo of its rights
under this Section 7.2, except, in each case, for those Losses for which Cosmo
has an obligation to indemnify the Salix Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 7.1, as to which Losses each Party shall indemnify the other Party to
the extent of its respective liability for such Losses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary, Salix shall have no
liability for, and Cosmo shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Salix
Indemnified Parties, from and against, any and all Losses, whenever asserted,
arising out of or relating to any contract, license, agreement, arrangement,
claim or understanding (whether written or oral) existing as of the Effective
Date to which Cosmo, Salix, or any of their respective Affiliates is a party
and which would be violated by any direct or indirect assignment,
transfer, licensing, sale, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, or other
disposition, or any Exploitation, of any Product.

7.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

(a) _Notice of Claim_. The indemnified party (the "Indemnified Party") shall
give the indemnifying Party (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice
(an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of any Losses or discovery of facts upon
which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification
under Section 7.1 or 7.2, but in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice.
Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and
the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount
of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish
promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents
received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.

(b) _Third Party Claims_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this
Article VII with respect to any Third Party Claim shall be governed by and be
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions :

 



26 (i) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party
Claim by the Indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment
that the Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in
respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the
Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against any Indemnified
Partys claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of
the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party,
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall immediately deliver to the Indemnifying Party all
original notices and documents (including court papers) received by any
Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Subject to clause
(ii) below, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.
In the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is
not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless a Salix Indemnified Party
or Cosmo Indemnified Party, as applicable, from and against the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of
suit) and any Losses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in its defense of the
Third Party Claim with respect to such Salix Indemnified Party or
Cosmo Indemnified Party, as applicable.

(ii) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 7.3(b)(i), any
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that such employment shall be at the
Indemnified Partys own expense unless (A) the employment thereof has been
specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, (B) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in
accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i) (in which case the Indemnified Party shall
control the defense), or (C) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently
adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both parties
under applicable law, ethical rules or equitable principles.

(iii) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment
of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not
result in the Indemnified Partys becoming subject to injunctive or other
relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in
any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in
writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of
any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on
such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem
appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party 

 



27  Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i), the Indemnifying Party shall
have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any
settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; _provided_ that it obtains the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an
Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or dispose of, any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(iv) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony,
provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal business hours
afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the
Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees and agents available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse
the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith.

(v) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs
and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed
on a calendar quarter basis in arrears by the Indemnifying Party, without
prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys right to contest the Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying
Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party.

7.4 _Insurance_.

 

(a) During the Term, each Party shall maintain (i) comprehensive general
liability insurance with a combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage of not less than Five Million United States Dollars
($5,000,000.00) and (ii) product liability/completed operations coverage with
a per claim limit of not less than Two Million United States Dollars
($2,000,000.00) (collectively, the "Policies"). If any Policy is written on a
claims-made basis, the retroactive date, if any, shall be not be later than

of five (5) years following the Term. Each Party shall provide prompt notice
to the other Party in the event that the first Partys Policies are canceled

29 8.2 _Force Majeure_. Neither Party shall be liable for delay in delivery or
nonperformance in whole or in part (other than a failure to pay any amount
due hereunder), nor shall the other Party have the right to terminate this
Agreement except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 8.2, where
delivery or performance has been affected by a condition beyond such Partys
reasonable control, including fires, floods, embargoes, shortages, epidemics,
quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorism,
insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor
disturbances, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any
governmental authority; _provided_ that the Party affected by such a condition
shall, within ten (10) days of its occurrence, give notice to the other Party
stating the nature of the condition, its anticipated duration and any action
being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance
shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is
reasonably required and the nonperforming Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy its inability to perform. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the suspension of performance continues for sixty (60)
days after the date of the occurrence, and such failure to perform would
constitute a material breach of this Agreement in the absence of such force
majeure event, the nonaffected Party may terminate this Agreement immediately
by written notice to the affected Party.

 

8.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations,
whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. Each
Party confirms that it is not relying on any representations or warranties of
the other Party except as specifically set forth herein. No amendment,
modification, release or discharge shall be binding upon the Parties unless in
writing and duly executed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

8.4 _Further Assurances_. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause
to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause
to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such
assignments, agreements, documents and instruments as may be necessary or as
the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or
to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof or to better
assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this
Agreement.

 

8.5 _Successors and Assigns_. The terms and provisions hereof shall inure to
the benefit of, and be binding upon, Salix, Cosmo and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

8.6 _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of a dispute between the Parties,
either Party may, by giving written notice of dispute to the other Party,
request a meeting of authorized representatives of the Parties for the purpose
of resolving the dispute. The Parties agree that, within thirty (30) days
after any such request, each Party shall

 



30  designate a representative to participate in dispute resolution discussions
that shall be held at a mutually acceptable time and place for the purpose of
resolving the dispute. Each Party agrees to negotiate in good faith to
resolve the dispute in a mutually acceptable manner. If for whatever reason
the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days after the
issuance of a notice of dispute, then either Party may, by written notice to
the other Party, submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 8.6.

 

(a) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the
breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce as then in effect ("ICC Rules"), _provided_
, that in the event and to the extent such rules conflict with the terms
of this Section 8.6, the terms of this Section 8.6 shall govern. Judgment on
the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be Dublin, Ireland. The
arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

(b) Except as provided in Section 8.6(c), the arbitration shall be held before
a single arbitrator, who shall be selected by agreement of the Parties, or,
if the Parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after commencement of
arbitration, then by the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC"). The
arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.6(b) shall be a practicing or
retired lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience
relating to agreements concerning the Manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical
products for the Territory.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 8.6(b), in the event that the dispute that is
subject to arbitration is one in which a Party seeks to recover an amount of
at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) from the other Party, then either
Party shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to the other Party
given at any time within ten (10) days after commencement of arbitration, to
require that the arbitration be held before a panel of three (3) arbitrators.
In such case, within thirty (30) days after the provision of notice described
in the preceding sentence, each Party shall select one person to act as
arbitrator. If a Party shall fail within the designated time period to select
an arbitrator, then the arbitrator to be selected by the Party shall be
selected by the ICC. The two (2) persons so selected as arbitrators shall
select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment. If
the two (2) initially selected arbitrators are unable or fail to agree upon
the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the ICC. Each
arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.6(c) shall be a practicing
lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience relating
to agreements concerning the Manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical
products.

 

(d) Each Party shall, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly
provide the other Party with copies of documents relevant to the issues
raised by the dispute on which the producing Party may rely in support of, or
in opposition to, any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or
the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator(s),
which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed
within forty five (45) days following the appointment of the arbitrator(s).

 



31 (e) It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances,
arbitration proceedings will be concluded within six (6) months from the date
the arbitrator is appointed (or, where a panel of three (3) arbitrators is
used, the date upon which the third arbitrator is appointed). The
arbitrator(s) may extend this time limit in the interests of justice. Failure
to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the
award.

(f) Except as may be required by Applicable Law (including applicable
securities laws or rules of a securities exchange) or as may be necessary to
enforce the arbitration award or the provisions of this Section 8.6, and
except for disclosures made by a Party to its accountants, insurers,
consultants, or attorneys or to actual or potential lenders, non-public
investors, rating agencies, acquirors, or business partners who are under
obligations to the disclosing Party to hold the disclosed information in
confidence, neither a Party nor its representatives may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

 

(g) The arbitrator(s) shall have discretion to allocate the Parties costs and
expenses for the arbitration (including attorneys fees), the fees of the
arbitrator(s), and the administrative fees of arbitration between the Parties
in proportion to the extent to which they prevail. Failing such allocation,
each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the
fees of the arbitrators and administrative fees of the arbitration.

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of Ireland, excluding any conflicts or choice of law
rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of
this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. The
Parties agree to exclude the application to this Agreement of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

8.8  _Audits_.

(a) Each Party shall have the right to have an independent certified public
accounting firm of internationally recognized standing, and reasonably
acceptable to the other Party, provided with access by such other Party during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable prior written notice, to examine
only those records of such other Party (and its Affiliates and sublicensees)
as may be reasonably necessary to determine, with respect to any Calendar Year
ending not more than three (3) years prior to the auditing Partys request,
the correctness or completeness of any payment made or statement or invoice
submitted under this Agreement. Such examinations may not (i) be conducted
more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless a previous audit during
such twelve (12) month period revealed an underpayment with respect to such
period or an incorrect statement submitted by the audited Party in respect of
such period

 



32  or the audited Party restates or revises such books and records for such
period) or (ii) be repeated for any Calendar Year. Results of such audit shall
(i) be (A) limited to information relating to the Products (including with
respect to COGS), (B) made available to both Parties in writing, and (C)
subject to ARTICLE V and (ii) not reveal any specific information of the
audited Party to the auditing Party other than (A) whether the audited Party
is in compliance with its payment obligations under this Agreement or whether
statements or invoices submitted by the audited Party under this Agreement are
true and correct, as the case may be, and (B) the amount of any additional
payments owed or excess payments made or any correction to statements or
invoices submitted by the audited Party under this Agreement, as the case may
be. Except as provided below, the cost of this examination shall be borne by
the auditing Party, unless the audit reveals a variance of more than five
percent (5%) from the reported or invoiced amounts, in which case the audited
Party shall bear the cost of the audit. Unless disputed pursuant to Section
8.8(b), if such audit concludes that additional payments were owed or that
excess payments were made during such period, the applicable Party shall make
such additional payments or reimburse such excess payments to the other
Party within sixty (60) days after the date on which such auditors written
report is delivered to the Parties. In addition, if (1) Cosmo is required to
reimburse excess payments to Salix as a result of the overstatement by Cosmo
of the Clinical Supply Price or Sample Supply Price, Cosmo shall pay interest
on such excess payment as provided in Section 8.9 from the date of original
payment by Salix, or (2) Salix is required to make an additional payment to
Cosmo as a result of the understatement by Salix of the Average Actual Price,
Salix shall pay interest on such additional payment as provided in Section 8.9
from the date originally due.

 

(b) In the event of a dispute of any audit under Section 8.8(a), Cosmo and
Salix shall work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. If the Parties
are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute
within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 8.6.

 

8.9 _Payments_.

(a) All payments to be made by one Party to the other (the "Payee") under
this Agreement shall be paid by bank wire transfer or by automated
clearinghouse (electronic funds transfer) in immediately available funds to
such bank account designated in writing by the Payee from time to time;
_provided_ that Salix shall be entitled to set off against any payment due to
Cosmo hereunder any payment due from Cosmo to Salix hereunder. Time for
payment shall be of the essence. Unless the paying Party notifies the Payee
in writing of a good faith dispute with respect to amounts not paid when due,
interest shall accrue thereon at the rate of prime plus one percent (1%), such
interest to begin accruing on a daily basis from the date payment is due;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a good faith dispute regarding
payment that is resolved to be due and is not paid within three (3) business
days after such resolution, interest shall accrue on any amount overdue at
the rate of prime plus one percent (1%), such interest to begin accruing on a
daily basis from the date such payment becomes overdue. For purposes of this
Agreement, the rate of prime shall be that rate of prime quoted by
Citibank, N.A., New York, New York, or any successor entity thereto.

 



33 (b) All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or
withholding for or on account of any taxes, duties, levies, or other charges
unless such deduction or withholding is required by Applicable Law to be
assessed against the payee. Salix shall consult in good faith with Cosmos tax
advisors (whose fees shall be borne solely by Cosmo) prior to deducting or
withholding any amounts as aforesaid. If the payor of any such payment is so
required to make any deduction or withholding from payments due to the payee,
the payor shall (i) promptly notify the payee of such requirement, (ii) pay
to the relevant authorities on payees behalf the full amount required to be
deducted or withheld promptly upon the earlier of determining that such
deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has
been assessed against the payee, and (iii) promptly forward to payee an
official receipt (or certified copy) or other documentation reasonably
acceptable to payee evidencing such payment to such authorities.

 

(c) All payments under this Agreement shall be made in United States Dollars.
Any amount or charge necessary for determining any amount payable hereunder
that is received or incurred in a currency other than United States Dollars
shall be translated into United States Dollars at the average daily purchase
price for United States Dollars using the relevant currency during the most
recently ended Calendar Quarter prior to the date of the relevant
transaction, using for such purpose daily purchase prices as reported in the
_Wall Street Journal_ as published for the New York City market.

 

8.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as giving any Person, other than the Parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

8.11  _Export Control_. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions
concerning the export of products or technical information from the United
States or other countries that may be imposed on the Parties from time to
time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any
technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or
any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner
that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental
approval, without first obtaining the written consent to do so from the
appropriate agency or other governmental entity in accordance with Applicable
Law.

 

8.12 _Assignment_. Except as expressly provided herein, neither Party may,
without the prior written consent of the other Party, sell, transfer, assign,
delegate, pledge, subcontract or otherwise dispose of, whether voluntarily,
involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any of its
rights or duties hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Salix may,
without such consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations
hereunder to an Affiliate or to the purchaser or sublicensee of Salixs rights
in and to the Products or any Product, (b) Cosmo may, without such consent,
assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more
Affiliates, and (c) either Party may, without such consent, assign this
Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to the purchaser of all
or substantially all of its assets or to any successor entity or acquirer in
the event of a merger, consolidation or change in

 



34  control of such Party. Any attempt to assign, transfer, subcontract or
delegate any portion of this Agreement in violation of this Section shall be
null and void. All validly assigned and delegated rights and obligations of
the Parties hereunder shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by and against the successors and permitted assigns of Salix or
Cosmo, as the case may be. In the event either Party assigns or delegates its
rights or obligations to another Person in accordance with the terms hereof,
the assignee or transferee shall assume all obligations of its assignor or
transferor under this Agreement and the assignor or transferor shall cease to
be a party to this Agreement and shall cease to have any rights or obligations
under this Agreement from and after the effective date of such assignment. No
such assignment or delegation shall relieve the assignor or transferor of any
of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cosmo shall have
the right, from time to time and without the necessity of providing notice to
or obtaining the consent of Salix, to delegate, assign, or subcontract to any
of its Affiliates Cosmos rights or responsibilities under this Agreement. In
all cases, Cosmo shall remain the contract Party under this Agreement and
shall remain responsible to Salix for the performance of all such obligations
under this Agreement.

 

8.13 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by either
Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

8.14  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the
rights or obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a
part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in
terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible
and reasonably acceptable to the Parties herein. __

 

8.15 _Independent Contractors_. The status of the Parties under this Agreement
shall be that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended or shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, agency, employer,
employee, or joint venture relationship between the Parties. Neither Party
shall have the right to enter into any agreements on behalf of the other
Party, nor shall it represent to any Person that it has any such right or
authority.

 



35 8.16 _Construction_. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires:
(a) words of any gender include each other gender; (b) words using the
singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and derivative
or similar words refer to this entire Agreement; (d) the terms "Article,"
"Section," "Schedule," or "clause" refer to the specified Article, Section,
Schedule or clause of this Agreement; (e) the term "or" has, except where
otherwise indicated, the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or";
(f) the term "including" or "includes" means "including without limitation"
or "includes without limitation"; and (g) references to any agreement,
instrument or other document in this Agreement refer to such agreement,
instrument or other document as originally executed or, if subsequently
amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time, as so amended, replaced
or supplemented and in effect at the relevant time of reference thereto.
Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to
calendar days unless business days are specified. The captions of this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define,
describe, extend, or limit the scope or intent of this Agreement or the intent
of any provision contained in this Agreement. The language of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language mutually chosen by the Parties and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against either Party.

 

8.17 _Remedies_. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and do
not exclude any other right or remedy provided by applicable law or otherwise
available except as expressly set forth herein.

8.18 _Counterparts; Facsimile Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) by
facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery
of a manually executed original counterpart of each such instrument.

 

8.19 _English Language_. This Agreement shall be written and executed in, and
all other communications under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
in, the English language. Any translation into any other language shall not be
an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in
interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English
version shall control.

(a) In the event that Cosmo, at any time during the Term, shall have reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section
2.3(a) or supply Salix, in a timely manner and in conformity with the
warranties set forth in Section 2.9, with the full quantity of Product
forecasted to be ordered or actually ordered by Salix (whether by reason
of force majeure or otherwise), Cosmo shall, as promptly as possible, notify
Salix thereof (and, in any event, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide at least fifteen (15) days advance notice thereof to Salix).
Promptly thereafter, the Parties shall meet to discuss and Cosmo shall use
best efforts to provide and satisfy Salix with the full quantity of conforming
Product or maintenance of the required inventory. Compliance by Cosmo with
this Section 2.10(a) shall not relieve Cosmo of any other obligation or
liability under this Agreement, including any obligation or liability under
Section 2.10(b), (c) or (d).

 

(b) If Cosmo fails to deliver the full quantity of Product specified in a
Purchase Order (other than as a result of Salixs failure to comply with its
release obligations in accordance with the timeline set forth in the Quality
Agreement) by fifteen (15) days after the required delivery date specified
therein and in conformity with the warranties set forth in Section 2.9, then
Salix may, at its option, (i) cancel all or any portion of such Purchase
Order, in which event Salix shall have no liability with respect to the
portion of such Purchase Order so cancelled, or (ii) accept late delivery of
all or any portion of the Product specified in such Purchase Order.

Purchase Order, in which event Salix shall have no liability with respect to
the portion of such Purchase Order so cancelled, or (ii) accept late delivery
of all or any portion of the Product specified in such Purchase Order.

 



-13- (d) If, during any month of the Term, Cosmo has insufficient quantities of
Product, or of Materials required for the Manufacture of Product, to fill all
Purchase Orders submitted by Salix that require delivery during such month,
Cosmo shall allocate and deliver to Salix an amount of Product equal to (i)
the aggregate amount of Product (together with equivalent versions of the
Product Manufactured for sale outside the Territory) available for delivery by
Cosmo and its Affiliates (or capable of being Manufactured using all available
Materials) in such month to all Persons worldwide, including Cosmo and its
Affiliates and its and their licensees, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the aggregate amount of Product delivered by Cosmo to
Salix during the six (6)-consecutive month period prior to the month in which
such shortage occurs, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
Product (together with equivalent versions of the Product Manufactured for
sale outside the Territory) delivered by Cosmo to all Persons
worldwide, including Cosmo and its Affiliates and its and their licensees,
during the six (6)-consecutive month period prior to the month in which such
shortage occurs. Compliance by Cosmo with this Section 2.10(d) shall not
relieve Cosmo of any other obligation or liability under this Agreement,
including under Section 2.10(b) or (c).

(e) In the event that Salix determines, within forty-five (45) days after
delivery thereof by Cosmo (or within forty-five (45) days after discovery of
any nonconformity that could not reasonably have been detected by a customary
inspection on delivery), that any Product supplied by Cosmo does not conform
to the warranties set forth in Section 2.9, Salix shall give Cosmo notice
thereof (including a sample of such Product, if applicable). Cosmo shall
undertake appropriate evaluation of such sample and shall notify
Salix whether it has confirmed such nonconformity within thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice from Salix. If Cosmo notifies Salix that it has
not confirmed such nonconformity, then the Parties shall submit the dispute to
an independent testing laboratory or other appropriate expert mutually
acceptable to the Parties (the "Testing Laboratory") for evaluation. Both
Parties shall cooperate with the Testing Laboratorys reasonable requests for
assistance in connection with its evaluation hereunder. The findings of the
Testing Laboratory shall be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. The
expenses of the Testing Laboratory shall be borne by Cosmo if the testing
confirms the nonconformity and otherwise by Salix. If the Testing Laboratory
or Cosmo confirms that the Product does not conform to the warranties set
forth in Section 2.9, then Cosmo promptly shall supply Salix with a conforming
quantity of Product at Cosmos expense. In addition, Cosmo promptly shall
reimburse Salix for all costs incurred by Salix with respect to such
nonconforming Product. Salix shall have the right to offset any such costs
against any payments owed by Salix to Cosmo under this Agreement.
Cosmo immediately shall notify Salix if at any time it discovers that any
Product delivered hereunder does not conform to the warranties set forth in
Section 2.9.

to be obtained in connection with such facility and its operation and
equipment used or to be used in the Manufacture of the Products (such
facility, once all such licenses, registrations and approvals have been
obtained, the "Secondary Facility"). The Secondary Facility shall be a
facility owned by Cosmo. Once the Secondary Facility has been established and
qualified in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall discuss
and agree in good faith how the Capacity shall be updated to reflect
additional capacity available through the Secondary Facility.

(c) Cosmo agrees that at all times during the Term it will not, unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Salix, allow its Capacity to be less than the
Current Capacity (or any increased capacity subsequently made available
pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or agreed pursuant to any Scale-Up Plans).

(d) In the event that at any time during the Term Salix contemplates that its
requirements for the Products to be purchased hereunder are likely to exceed
the Current Capacity (or any increased Capacity as of such date), Salix shall
promptly notify Cosmo and the Parties shall thereafter discuss in good faith
plans to increase Cosmos Capacity in respect of the Products so as to meet
Salixs anticipated needs (as mutually agreed upon in writing, the "Scale-Up
Plans"). Cosmo agrees to use its best efforts to implement any mutually agreed
upon Scale-Up Plan in accordance with its terms.

such changes affect Cosmos Manufacturing of the applicable Product
hereunder.

 



-15- (ii) Cosmo shall not amend, modify or supplement the Specifications, the
Manufacturing process, or the test methods for any Product or any Materials
or sources of Materials used in connection with Manufacturing the Products
without the prior written consent of Salix.

 

(iii) Salix shall reimburse Cosmo for reasonable expenses that are actually
incurred by Cosmo in connection with any material amendment of the
Specifications as a result of obsolescence of Materials, goods-in-process, and
finished goods not suitable for other use in the business or operations of
Cosmo or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Salixs liability for such reimbursement shall be limited to levels of
inventory that are consistent with the most recent Firm Forecast, plus twenty
percent (20%).

 

(iv) Cosmo shall be solely responsible for any and all increased costs or
expenses incurred by it or Salix as a result of any amendment of
the Specifications, the Manufacturing process or the test methods for any
Product (i) requested by Cosmo and consented to in writing by Salix as

set forth in Section 2.9.

(c) _Capital Expenditures_. If Cosmo reasonably believes that the Manufacture
of (i) a New Product in accordance with the New Product Specifications,
Manufacturing process, and the test methods therefor provided by Salix or (ii)
a Product in accordance with any amendment to the Specifications, the
Manufacturing process, or the test methods for such Product required by Salix,
in either case ((i) or (ii)) would require material capital expenditures for
plant, equipment or process upgrades, the Parties shall, for a period of not
less than thirty (30) days after Salix provides such information, negotiate in
good faith the amount of capital expenditures required and an appropriate
allocation of such capital expenditures between the Parties, taking into
account the expected use by Cosmo of such plant, equipment or process upgrades
to Manufacture products for customers in addition to Salix. If, after such
period, the Parties cannot agree on the amount of such capital expenditures or
the appropriate allocation of such capital expenditures between the Parties,
then the Parties shall submit the dispute to an appropriately qualified expert
of recognized repute and credentials mutually agreed by the Parties, which
expert shall determine the amount of such capital expenditures or the
appropriate allocation of such capital expenditures between the Parties within
thirty (30) days after the dispute is referred to him or her. In the event
that the matter is submitted to an expert in accordance with the foregoing
sentence, the expert shall use such procedures as such expert may consider
necessary or appropriate to reach a conclusion. Both Parties shall cooperate
with such experts reasonable requests for assistance in connection with its
analysis hereunder. The Parties shall be bound by such experts determination,
absent manifest error. Each Party shall bear fifty percent (50%) of the
expenses of the expert.

 



-16- (d) _Capacity_. In the event that (i) the Manufacture of any New Product
or (ii) any amendment to the Specifications, the Manufacturing process, or
the test methods for any Product, in either case adversely affects Cosmos
ability to maintain its Capacity at the Current Capacity (or any increased
capacity as subsequently made available pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or agreed
pursuant to any Scale-Up Plan), the Parties shall discuss in good faith a
Scale-Up Plan to address such shortfall in Capacity.

 

2.14 _Quality Agreement_. Salix and Cosmo shall, promptly following the
Effective Date and in any event prior to any commercial sale of the Products
Manufactured by Cosmo hereunder, prepare and enter into a reasonable and
customary quality agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions upon
which Cosmo will conduct its quality activities in connection with this
Agreement (the "Quality Agreement"). Each Party shall duly and punctually
perform all of its obligations under the Quality Agreement.

 

2.15 _Quality Control Analyses and Release_. Cosmo shall be responsible for
all quality control analyses and quality assurance of the Products;
_provided_ that all Products shall be final released by Salix, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the Quality Agreement. For avoidance of doubt,
such release of Product by Salix shall not limit Salixs rights in respect of
Product that does not comply with the warranty set forth in Section 2.9,
including Salixs right to reject Product pursuant to Section 2.10(e).

 

2.16 _Maintenance of Facilities_.

competent jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Receiving Party
shall first have given notice to the Disclosing Party and given the Disclosing
Party a reasonable opportunity to quash such order or to obtain a protective
order requiring that the Confidential Information or documents that are the
subject of such order be held in confidence by such court or governmental body
or, if disclosed, be used only for the purposes for which the order was
issued; and  _provided_ _further_ that if a disclosure order is not quashed
or a protective order is not obtained, the Confidential Information disclosed
in response to such court or governmental order shall be limited to that
information that is legally required to be disclosed in such response to such
court or governmental order;

(ii) made pursuant to Section 2.23; or

 

(iii) otherwise required by law or regulation, in the opinion of legal counsel
to the Receiving Party.

 

(b) Salix may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such
disclosure is made to Regulatory Authorities as required in connection with
any filing, application or request for Regulatory Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that reasonable measures shall be taken to assure confidential
treatment of such information.

 

(c) To the extent, if any, that a Party concludes in good faith that it is
required by applicable laws or regulations to file or register this Agreement
or a notification thereof with any governmental authority, including the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, such Party may do so, and the other Party
shall cooperate in such

 



-23-  filing or notification and shall execute all documents reasonably required
in connection therewith. In such situation, the filing Party shall request
confidential treatment of sensitive provisions of the Agreement, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law and in consultation with the other Party.
The Parties shall promptly inform each other as to the activities or inquiries
of any such governmental authority relating to this Agreement, and shall
cooperate to respond to any request for further information therefrom.

5.4 _Notification_. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party
immediately, and cooperate with the Disclosing Party as the Disclosing Party
may reasonably request, upon the Receiving Partys discovery of any loss or
compromise of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information.

5.5 _Remedies_. Each Party agrees that the unauthorized use or disclosure of
any information by the Receiving Party in violation of this Agreement will
cause severe and irreparable damage to the Disclosing Party. In the event of
any violation of this ARTICLE V, the Receiving Party agrees that the
Disclosing Party shall be authorized and entitled to obtain from any court of
competent jurisdiction injunctive relief, whether preliminary or permanent,
without the necessity of proving irreparable harm or monetary damages, as well
as any other relief permitted by applicable law. The Receiving Party agrees to
waive any requirement that the Disclosing Party post bond as a condition for
obtaining any such relief.

5.6 _Use of Names_. Neither Party shall mention or otherwise use the name,
insignia, symbol, trademark, trade name or logotype of the other Party (or any
abbreviation or adaptation thereof) in any publication, press release,
promotional material or other form of publicity without the prior written
approval of such other Party in each instance. The restrictions imposed by
this Section 5.6 shall not prohibit either Party from making any disclosure
identifying the other Party that is required by Applicable Law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that reasonable measures shall be taken to assure confidential
treatment of such information.

5.7  _Press Releases_. Except as expressly provided in Section 5.3, neither
Party shall make a press release or other public announcement regarding this
Agreement, the terms hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written approval of the other Party. Each Party shall provide the
other with the proposed text of any such press release or public announcement
for review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, as early as possible, but in no event less than four
(4) business days in advance of the publication, communication or
dissemination thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the receiving Party shall
be deemed to have approved any such press release or public announcement if
it fails to notify the proposing Party in writing of any objections to such
press release or public announcement within three (3) business days after
receipt by the receiving Party of the text of such public announcement.

 



-24- ARTICLE VI. TERM AND TERMINATION

remain in effect until the expiration or earlier termination of the License
and Collaboration Agreement (the "Term").

6.2 _Remedies Other Than Termination_. Neither Party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement, in part or in its entirety, for any reason. It is
the Parties intent to provide relief or compensation to either Party

Agreement but through remedies in law or equity, such as injunctive relief,
specific performance, and monetary damages.

(a) The expiration of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any rights
or obligations of the Parties that may have accrued prior to such expiration.
Those provisions that by their terms or intent are required to survive the
expiration of the Agreement in order to give effect to the intent of the
Parties shall so survive. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of
ARTICLE I, Sections 2.9, 2.20, 2.22, ARTICLE V, this ARTICLE VI, ARTICLE VII,
and ARTICLE VIII shall survive the expiration of this Agreement and continue
thereafter in accordance with and to the extent of their terms. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, expiration of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall not limit remedies that may
otherwise be available at law or in equity.

 

(b) Upon expiration of this Agreement, each Party, at the request of the
other, shall return all data, files, records and other materials in its

ARTICLE VII. INDEMNIFICATION

 

7.1 _Cosmo Indemnification_. Cosmo shall indemnify Salix, its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the
"Salix Indemnified Parties"), and defend and hold each of them harmless, from
and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements)
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by any of them in connection with (a) any
and all suits, actions, investigations, claims or demands of Third Parties
(collectively, all "Third Party Claims") arising from or occurring as a
result of (i) the breach by Cosmo of any of its representations or warranties
set forth in this Agreement, (ii) Cosmos breach of any covenant, undertaking
or other term contained in this Agreement, (iii) Cosmos negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of this Agreement, or (iv) the storage,
release, or disposal of any

 



-25-  hazardous or regulated material or any waste by Cosmo, or (b) the
enforcement by Salix of its rights under this Section 7.1, except, in each
case, for those Losses for which Salix has an obligation to indemnify the
Cosmo Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.2, as to which Losses each
Party shall indemnify the other Party to the extent of its respective
liability for such Losses.

 

7.2 _Salix Indemnification_. Salix shall indemnify Cosmo, its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the
"Cosmo Indemnified Parties"), and defend and hold each of them harmless, from
and against any and all Losses incurred by any of them in connection with (a)
any and all Third Party Claims arising from or occurring as a result of (i)
the breach by Salix of any of its representations or warranties set forth in
this Agreement, or (ii) Salixs breach of any covenant, undertaking or other
term contained in this Agreement, or (b) the enforcement by Cosmo of its
rights under this Section 7.2, except, in each case, for those Losses for
which Cosmo has an obligation to indemnify the Salix Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 7.1, as to which Losses each Party shall indemnify
the other Party to the extent of its respective liability for such Losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary,
Salix shall have no liability for, and Cosmo shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Salix Indemnified Parties, from and against, any and all Losses,
whenever asserted, arising out of or relating to any contract, license,
agreement, arrangement, claim or understanding (whether written or oral)
existing as of the Effective Date to which Cosmo, Salix, or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party and which would be violated by any direct or
indirect assignment, transfer, licensing, sale, pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation, or other disposition, or any Exploitation, of any Product.

7.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) _Notice of Claim_. The indemnified party (the "Indemnified Party") shall
give the indemnifying Party (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice
(an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of any Losses or discovery of facts upon
which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification
under Section 7.1 or 7.2, but in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice.
Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and
the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount
of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish
promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents
received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.

(b) _Third Party Claims_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this
Article VII with respect to any Third Party Claim shall be governed by and be
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

(i) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party
Claim by

 



-26-  the Indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the
Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in respect of
the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying
Party of any defenses it may assert against any Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third
Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall immediately deliver to the Indemnifying Party all
original notices and documents (including court papers) received by any
Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Subject to clause
(ii) below, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.
In the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is
not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless a Salix Indemnified Party
or Cosmo Indemnified Party, as applicable, from and against the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of
suit) and any Losses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in its defense of the
Third Party Claim with respect to such Salix Indemnified Party or Cosmo
Indemnified Party, as applicable.

(ii) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 7.3(b)(i), any
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that such employment shall be at the
Indemnified Partys own expense unless (A) the employment thereof has been
specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, (B) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in
accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i) (in which case the Indemnified Party shall
control the defense), or (C) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently
adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both parties
under applicable law, ethical rules or equitable principles.

 

(iii) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of
money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result
in the Indemnified Partys becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or
otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in any
manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged
in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any
judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such
terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem
appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party
Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i), the Indemnifying Party
shall have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any
settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; _provided_ that it obtains the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party

 



-27-  (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement or other
disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party that is reached without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no
Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or dispose of, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(iv) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony,
provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal business hours
afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the
Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees and agents available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse
the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith.

(v) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs
and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed
on a calendar quarter basis in arrears by the Indemnifying Party, without
prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys right to contest the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the
Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party.

 

7.4 _Insurance_.

(a) During the Term, each Party shall maintain (i) comprehensive general
liability insurance with a combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage of not less than Five Million United States Dollars
($5,000,000.00) and (ii) product liability/completed operations coverage with
a per claim limit of not less than Two Million United States Dollars
($2,000,000.00) (collectively, the "Policies"). If any Policy is written on a
claims-made basis, the retroactive date, if any, shall be not be later than
the Effective Date. In addition, such coverage shall be continued for a period
of five (5) years following the Term. Each Party shall provide prompt notice
to the other Party in the event that the first Partys Policies are canceled
or subjected to a reduction of coverage or any other material adverse
modification.

(b) Each Party shall furnish certificates of insurance for its Policies to
the other Party within ten (10) days after the Effective Date.

-29- 8.2 _Force Majeure_. Neither Party shall be liable for delay in delivery or
nonperformance in whole or in part (other than a failure to pay any amount
due hereunder), nor shall the other Party have the right to terminate this
Agreement except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 8.2, where
delivery or performance has been affected by a condition beyond such Partys
reasonable control, including fires, floods, embargoes, shortages, epidemics,
quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorism,
insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor
disturbances, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any
governmental authority; _provided_ that the Party affected by such a condition
shall, within ten (10) days of its occurrence, give notice to the other Party
stating the nature of the condition, its anticipated duration and any action
being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance
shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is
reasonably required and the nonperforming Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy its inability to perform. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the suspension of performance continues for sixty (60)
days after the date of the occurrence, and such failure to perform would
constitute a material breach of this Agreement in the absence of such force
majeure event, the nonaffected Party may terminate this Agreement immediately
by written notice to the affected Party.

 

8.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations,
whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. Each
Party confirms that it is not relying on any representations or warranties of
the other Party except as specifically set forth herein. No amendment,
modification, release or discharge shall be binding upon the Parties unless in
writing and duly executed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

8.4 _Further Assurances_. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause
to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause
to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such
assignments, agreements, documents and instruments as may be necessary or as
the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or
to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof or to better
assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this
Agreement.

 

8.5 _Successors and Assigns_. The terms and provisions hereof shall inure to
the benefit of, and be binding upon, Salix, Cosmo and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

8.6 _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of a dispute between the Parties,
either Party may, by giving written notice of dispute to the other Party,
request a meeting of authorized representatives of the Parties for the purpose
of resolving the dispute. The Parties agree that, within thirty (30) days
after any such request, each Party shall designate a representative to
participate in dispute resolution discussions that shall be held at a mutually
acceptable time and place for the purpose of resolving the dispute. Each Party
agrees to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute in a mutually

 



-30-  acceptable manner. If for whatever reason the Parties are unable to resolve
the dispute within sixty (60) days after the issuance of a notice of dispute,
then either Party may, by written notice to the other Party, submit the
dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 8.6.

(a) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the
breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce as then in effect ("ICC Rules"), _provided_
, that in the event and to the extent such rules conflict with the terms of
this Section 8.6, the terms of this Section 8.6 shall govern. Judgment on the
award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be Dublin, Ireland. The
arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 8.6(c), the arbitration shall be held before
a single arbitrator, who shall be selected by agreement of the Parties, or,
if the Parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after commencement of
arbitration, then by the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC"). The
arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.6(b) shall be a practicing or
retired lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience
relating to agreements concerning the Manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical
products for the Territory.

 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 8.6(b), in the event that the dispute that is
subject to arbitration is one in which a Party seeks to recover an amount of
at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) from the other Party, then either
Party shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to the other Party
given at any time within ten (10) days after commencement of arbitration,
to require that the arbitration be held before a panel of three (3)
arbitrators. In such case, within thirty (30) days after the provision of
notice described in the preceding sentence, each Party shall select one person
to act as arbitrator. If a Party shall fail within the designated time period
to select an arbitrator, then the arbitrator to be selected by the Party shall
be selected by the ICC. The two (2) persons so selected as arbitrators shall
select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment. If
the two (2) initially selected arbitrators are unable or fail to agree upon
the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the ICC. Each
arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.6(c) shall be a practicing
lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience relating
to agreements concerning the Manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical
products.

 

(d) Each Party shall, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly
provide the other Party with copies of documents relevant to the issues
raised by the dispute on which the producing Party may rely in support of, or
in opposition to, any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or
the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator(s),
which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed
within forty five (45) days following the appointment of the arbitrator(s).

 



-31- (e) It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances,
arbitration proceedings will be concluded within six (6) months from the date
the arbitrator is appointed (or, where a panel of three (3) arbitrators is
used, the date upon which the third arbitrator is appointed). The
arbitrator(s) may extend this time limit in the interests of justice. Failure
to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the
award.

(f) Except as may be required by Applicable Law (including applicable
securities laws or rules of a securities exchange) or as may be necessary to
enforce the arbitration award or the provisions of this Section 8.6, and
except for disclosures made by a Party to its accountants, insurers,
consultants, or attorneys or to actual or potential lenders, non-public
investors, rating agencies, acquirors, or business partners who are under
obligations to the disclosing Party to hold the disclosed information in
confidence, neither a Party nor its representatives may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

 

(g) The arbitrator(s) shall have discretion to allocate the Parties costs and
expenses for the arbitration (including attorneys fees), the fees of the
arbitrator(s), and the administrative fees of arbitration between the Parties
in proportion to the extent to which they prevail. Failing such allocation,
each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the
fees of the arbitrators and administrative fees of the arbitration.

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of Ireland, excluding any conflicts or choice of law
rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of
this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. The
Parties agree to exclude the application to this Agreement of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

8.8  _Audits_.

(a) Each Party shall have the right to have an independent certified public
accounting firm of internationally recognized standing, and reasonably
acceptable to the other Party, provided with access by such other Party during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable prior written notice, to examine
only those records of such other Party (and its Affiliates and sublicensees)
as may be reasonably necessary to determine, with respect to any Calendar Year
ending not more than three (3) years prior to the auditing Partys request,
the correctness or completeness of any payment made or statement or invoice
submitted under this Agreement. Such examinations may not (i) be conducted
more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless a previous audit during
such twelve (12) month period revealed an underpayment with respect to such
period or an incorrect statement submitted by the audited Party in respect of
such period or the audited Party restates or revises such books and records
for such period) or (ii) be repeated for any Calendar Year. Results of such
audit shall (i) be (A) limited to information relating to the Products
(including with respect to COGS), (B) made

 



-32-  available to both Parties in writing, and (C) subject to ARTICLE V and (ii)
not reveal any specific information of the audited Party to the auditing Party
other than (A) whether the audited Party is in compliance with its payment
obligations under this Agreement or whether statements or invoices submitted
by the audited Party under this Agreement are true and correct, as the case
may be, and (B) the amount of any additional payments owed or excess payments
made or any correction to statements or invoices submitted by the audited
Party under this Agreement, as the case may be. Except as provided below, the
cost of this examination shall be borne by the auditing Party, unless the
audit reveals a variance of more than five percent (5%) from the reported or
invoiced amounts, in which case the audited Party shall bear the cost of the
audit. Unless disputed pursuant to Section 8.8(b), if such audit concludes
that additional payments were owed or that excess payments were made during
such period, the applicable Party shall make such additional payments or
reimburse such excess payments to the other Party within sixty (60) days
after the date on which such auditors written report is delivered to the
Parties. In addition, if (1) Cosmo is required to reimburse excess payments to
Salix as a result of the overstatement by Cosmo of the Clinical Supply Price
or Sample Supply Price, Cosmo shall pay interest on such excess payment as
provided in Section 8.9 from the date of original payment by Salix, or (2)
Salix is required to make an additional payment to Cosmo as a result of the
understatement by Salix of the Average Actual Price, Salix shall pay interest
on such additional payment as provided in Section 8.9 from the date originally
due.

 

(b) In the event of a dispute of any audit under Section 8.8(a), Cosmo and
Salix shall work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. If the Parties
are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute
within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 8.6.

 

8.9 _Payments_.

(a) All payments to be made by one Party to the other (the "Payee") under
this Agreement shall be paid by bank wire transfer or by automated
clearinghouse (electronic funds transfer) in immediately available funds to
such bank account designated in writing by the Payee from time to time;
_provided_ that Salix shall be entitled to set off against any payment due to
Cosmo hereunder any payment due from Cosmo to Salix hereunder. Time for
payment shall be of the essence. Unless the paying Party notifies the Payee
in writing of a good faith dispute with respect to amounts not paid when due,
interest shall accrue thereon at the rate of prime plus one percent (1%), such
interest to begin accruing on a daily basis from the date payment is due;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a good faith dispute regarding
payment that is resolved to be due and is not paid within three (3) business
days after such resolution, interest shall accrue on any amount overdue at
the rate of prime plus one percent (1%), such interest to begin accruing on a
daily basis from the date such payment becomes overdue. For purposes of this
Agreement, the rate of prime shall be that rate of prime quoted by
Citibank, N.A., New York, New York, or any successor entity thereto.

 



-33- (b) All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or
withholding for or on account of any taxes, duties, levies, or other charges
unless such deduction or withholding is required by Applicable Law to be
assessed against the payee. Salix shall consult in good faith with Cosmos tax
advisors (whose fees shall be borne solely by Cosmo) prior to deducting or
withholding any amounts as aforesaid. If the payor of any such payment is so
required to make any deduction or withholding from payments due to the payee,
the payor shall (i) promptly notify the payee of such requirement, (ii) pay
to the relevant authorities on payees behalf the full amount required to be
deducted or withheld promptly upon the earlier of determining that such
deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has
been assessed against the payee, and (iii) promptly forward to payee an
official receipt (or certified copy) or other documentation reasonably
acceptable to payee evidencing such payment to such authorities.

 

(c) All payments under this Agreement shall be made in United States Dollars.
Any amount or charge necessary for determining any amount payable hereunder
that is received or incurred in a currency other than United States Dollars
shall be translated into United States Dollars at the average daily purchase
price for United States Dollars using the relevant currency during the most
recently ended Calendar Quarter prior to the date of the relevant
transaction, using for such purpose daily purchase prices as reported in the
_Wall Street Journal_ as published for the New York City market.

 

8.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as giving any Person, other than the Parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

8.11  _Export Control_. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions
concerning the export of products or technical information from the United
States or other countries that may be imposed on the Parties from time to
time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any

or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same
or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

 

8.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights
or obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and reasonably
acceptable to the Parties herein. __

8.15 _Independent Contractors_. The status of the Parties under this
Agreement shall be that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement

Party, nor shall it represent to any Person that it has any such right or
authority.

Forecast shall be non-binding and shall be used by Cosmo for planning purposes
only.

 

(b) Commencing with the first month after the month in which the Effective
Date occurs, on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month during the Term (or, at
Salixs discretion, at any time from the eighth (8th) day of such month up to
and including the twenty-second (22nd) day of such month), Salix shall
deliver to Cosmo a written good faith forecast estimating the quantities of
the Products that Salix expects to purchase from Cosmo for each month during
the following twelve (12) months (each, a "Forecast"). The first three (3)
months of each Forecast shall be a "Firm Forecast". Except as provided in
clause (c) below, each Forecast shall be non-binding and shall be used by
Cosmo for planning purposes only.

(c) Without duplication of any previously delivered Purchase Order, each Firm
Forecast shall be accompanied by a Purchase Order for Product to be delivered
to Salix during each of the first three (3) months, respectively, set forth in
such Firm Forecast. The quantity of Product specified in any Purchase Order

following determination of the Specifications, and (ii) shall not be less
than eighty percent (80%) or more than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of
the quantities specified in the most recent Firm Forecast applicable to such
month.

 

(d) Cosmo shall promptly acknowledge its receipt of each Purchase Order. With
respect to each Purchase Order, Salix shall be obligated to purchase, and

preceding Calendar Quarter (the "Quarterly Activity Report") stating (a) the
gross sales and Net Sales of Products sold by Salix and its Affiliates during
the Calendar Quarter just ended, making reference to the specific deductions
taken in accordance with the definition of Net Sales, and (b) the actual
number of Commercial Units sold during such Calendar Quarter.

2.5 _Commercial Supply Price; True-Up_. In consideration of Cosmos supply of
Commercial Units of a Product hereunder in each Calendar Year, Salix shall

actually paid or payable by Salix to Cosmo for the delivery of Commercial
Units to Salix in such Calendar Year; and (ii) the amount of the
reconciliation payment (the "Reconciliation Payment") for such Calendar Year
owed by Salix to Cosmo, or Cosmo to Salix (as applicable), based on the
calculations in subclauses (i) and (ii) above, such that after such
Reconciliation Payment (by the appropriate Party to the other) Salix has paid
to Cosmo the total Average Actual Price for each Commercial Unit purchased by

due within ninety (90) days after receipt by Salix of notice from the Testing
Laboratory that the invoiced Commercial Units, Sample Units or Clinical Units
of Product, as applicable, are conforming or, subject to Section 2.10, receipt
by Salix of replacement Product; _provided further_ , that if Salix disputes
any portion of an invoice, it shall pay the undisputed portion and shall
provide Cosmo with written notice of the disputed portion and its reasons

believe that it will be unable to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section
2.3(a) or supply Salix, in a timely manner and in conformity with the
warranties set forth in Section 2.9, with the full quantity of Product
forecasted to be ordered or actually ordered by Salix (whether by reason
of force majeure or otherwise), Cosmo shall, as promptly as possible, notify
Salix thereof (and, in any event, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide at least fifteen (15) days advance notice thereof to Salix).
Promptly thereafter, the Parties shall meet to discuss and Cosmo shall use
best efforts to provide and satisfy Salix with the full quantity of conforming
Product or maintenance of the required inventory. Compliance by Cosmo with
this Section 2.10(a) shall not relieve Cosmo of any other obligation or
liability under this Agreement, including any obligation or liability under
Section 2.10(b), (c) or (d).

 

(b) If Cosmo fails to deliver the full quantity of Product specified in a
Purchase Order (other than as a result of Salixs failure to comply with its
release obligations in accordance with the timeline set forth in the Quality
Agreement) by fifteen (15) days after the required delivery date specified
therein and in conformity with the warranties set forth in Section 2.9, then
Salix may, at its option, (i) cancel all or any portion of such Purchase
Order, in which event Salix shall have no liability with respect to the
portion of such Purchase Order so cancelled, or (ii) accept late delivery of
all or any portion of the Product specified in such Purchase Order.

(c) If Cosmo fails to deliver the full quantity of Product specified in

specified therein and in conformity with the warranties set forth in Section
2.9, then Salix may, at its option, (i) cancel all or any portion of such
Purchase Order, in which event Salix shall have no liability with respect to
the portion of such Purchase Order so cancelled, or (ii) accept late delivery
of all or any portion of the Product specified in such Purchase Order.

the aggregate amount of Product (together with equivalent versions of the
Product Manufactured for sale outside the Territory) available for delivery by
Cosmo and its Affiliates (or capable of being Manufactured using all

-13-  including Cosmo and its Affiliates and its and their licensees, multiplied
by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of Product
delivered by Cosmo to Salix during the six (6)-consecutive month period prior
to the month in which such shortage occurs, and the denominator of which is
the aggregate amount of Product (together with equivalent versions of the
Product Manufactured for sale outside the Territory) delivered by Cosmo to
all Persons worldwide, including Cosmo and its Affiliates and its and their
licensees, during the six (6)-consecutive month period prior to the month in

(e) In the event that Salix determines, within forty-five (45) days after
delivery thereof by Cosmo (or within forty-five (45) days after discovery of
any nonconformity that could not reasonably have been detected by a customary
inspection on delivery), that any Product supplied by Cosmo does not conform
to the warranties set forth in Section 2.9, Salix shall give Cosmo notice
thereof (including a sample of such Product, if applicable). Cosmo shall
undertake appropriate evaluation of such sample and shall notify Salix whether
it has confirmed such nonconformity within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice from Salix. If Cosmo notifies Salix that it has not confirmed
such nonconformity, then the Parties shall submit the dispute to an
independent testing laboratory or other appropriate expert mutually acceptable
to the Parties (the "Testing Laboratory") for evaluation. Both Parties shall
cooperate with the Testing Laboratorys reasonable requests for assistance in
connection with its evaluation hereunder. The findings of the Testing
Laboratory shall be binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. The
expenses of the Testing Laboratory shall be borne by Cosmo if the testing
confirms the nonconformity and otherwise by Salix. If the Testing Laboratory
or Cosmo confirms that the Product does not conform to the warranties set

quantity of Product at Cosmos expense. In addition, Cosmo promptly shall
reimburse Salix for all costs incurred by Salix with respect to such
nonconforming Product. Salix shall have the right to offset any such costs

Applicable Law to be obtained in connection with such facility and its
operation and equipment used or to be used in the Manufacture of the Products
(such facility, once all such licenses, registrations and approvals have been
obtained, the

 



-14-  "Secondary Facility"). The Secondary Facility shall be a facility owned by
Cosmo. Once the Secondary Facility has been established and qualified in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall discuss and agree
in good faith how the Capacity shall be updated to reflect additional capacity
available through the Secondary Facility.

 

(c) Cosmo agrees that at all times during the Term it will not, unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Salix, allow its Capacity to be less than the
Current Capacity (or any increased capacity subsequently made available
pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or agreed pursuant to any Scale-Up Plans).

 

(d) In the event that at any time during the Term Salix contemplates that its
requirements for the Products to be purchased hereunder are likely to exceed
the Current Capacity (or any increased Capacity as of such date), Salix shall
promptly notify Cosmo and the Parties shall thereafter discuss in good faith
plans to increase Cosmos Capacity in respect of the Products so as to meet
Salixs anticipated needs (as mutually agreed upon in writing, the "Scale-Up
Plans"). Cosmo agrees to use its best efforts to implement any mutually agreed
upon Scale-Up Plan in accordance with its terms.

provide Cosmo with appropriate documentation relating to any such changes to
the Specifications, Manufacturing process or test methods to the extent that
such changes affect Cosmos Manufacturing of the applicable Product
hereunder.

(ii) Cosmo shall not amend, modify or supplement the Specifications,
the Manufacturing process, or the test methods for any Product or any
Materials or sources of Materials used in connection with Manufacturing the
Products without the prior written consent of Salix.

 

(iii) Salix shall reimburse Cosmo for reasonable expenses that are actually
incurred by Cosmo in connection with any material amendment of
the Specifications as a result of obsolescence of Materials, goods-in-
process, and finished goods not suitable for other use in the business or
operations of Cosmo or any of its Affiliates; _provided, however_ , that
Salixs liability for such reimbursement shall be limited to levels of
inventory that are consistent with the most recent Firm Forecast, plus twenty
percent (20%).

 



-15- (iv) Cosmo shall be solely responsible for any and all increased costs or
expenses incurred by it or Salix as a result of any amendment of the
Specifications, the Manufacturing process or the test methods for any Product
(i) requested by Cosmo and consented to in writing by Salix as contemplated by
Section 2.13(b)(ii) or (ii) required by Salix as a result of Cosmos failure
to Manufacture the Products in conformity with the warranties set forth in
Section 2.9.

 

(c) _Capital Expenditures_. If Cosmo reasonably believes that the Manufacture
of (i) a New Product in accordance with the New Product Specifications,
Manufacturing process, and the test methods therefor provided by Salix or (ii)
a Product in accordance with any amendment to the Specifications, the
Manufacturing process, or the test methods for such Product required by
Salix, in either case ((i) or (ii)) would require material capital
expenditures for plant, equipment or process upgrades, the Parties shall, for
a period of not less than thirty (30) days after Salix provides such
information, negotiate in good faith the amount of capital expenditures
required and an appropriate allocation of such capital expenditures between
the Parties, taking into account the expected use by Cosmo of such plant,
equipment or process upgrades to Manufacture products for customers in
addition to Salix. If, after such period, the Parties cannot agree on the
amount of such capital expenditures or the appropriate allocation of such
capital expenditures between the Parties, then the Parties shall submit the
dispute to an appropriately qualified expert of recognized repute and
credentials mutually agreed by the Parties, which expert shall determine the
amount of such capital expenditures or the appropriate allocation of such
capital expenditures between the Parties within thirty (30) days after the
dispute is referred to him or her. In the event that the matter is submitted
to an expert in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the expert shall use
such procedures as such expert may consider necessary or appropriate to reach
a conclusion. Both Parties shall cooperate with such experts reasonable
requests for assistance in connection with its analysis hereunder. The Parties
shall be bound by such experts determination, absent manifest error. Each
Party shall bear fifty percent (50%) of the expenses of the expert.

(d) _Capacity_. In the event that (i) the Manufacture of any New Product or
(ii) any amendment to the Specifications, the Manufacturing process, or the
test methods for any Product, in either case adversely affects Cosmos ability
to maintain its Capacity at the Current Capacity (or any increased capacity
as subsequently made available pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or agreed pursuant
to any Scale-Up Plan), the Parties shall discuss in good faith a Scale-Up Plan
to address such shortfall in Capacity.

Effective Date and in any event prior to any commercial sale of the Products
Manufactured by Cosmo hereunder, prepare and enter into a reasonable and
customary quality agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions upon
which Cosmo will conduct its quality activities in connection with this
Agreement (the "Quality Agreement"). Each Party shall duly and punctually
perform all of its obligations under the Quality Agreement.

 



-16- 2.15 _Quality Control Analyses and Release_. Cosmo shall be responsible for
all quality control analyses and quality assurance of the Products;
_provided_ that all Products shall be final released by Salix, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the Quality Agreement. For avoidance of doubt,
such release of Product by Salix shall not limit Salixs rights in respect of
Product that does not comply with the warranty set forth in Section 2.9,
including Salixs right to reject Product pursuant to Section 2.10(e).

 

2.16 _Maintenance of Facilities_.

the Product exclusively at the Primary Facility and, after it has been
established in accordance with Section 2.11(b), the Secondary Facility.

(b) Cosmo shall at all times during the Term ensure that any and all
licenses, registrations, and Regulatory Authority approvals required by
Applicable Law to be obtained in connection with each Facility and its

Salix as contemplated hereunder have been obtained and are in all respects
current and in full force and effect.

 

(c) Cosmo shall at all times during the Term maintain each Facility and

(a) at Cosmos own cost, making its employees, consultants and other staff
available upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to attend
meetings with Regulatory Authorities concerning the Products;

 

(b) at Cosmos own cost, disclosing and making available to Salix, in whatever
form Salix may reasonably request, all Manufacturing and quality control

quantities of the Products in accordance with the terms hereof, including by
obtaining all licenses, registrations, and Regulatory Authority approvals
required by Applicable Law to be obtained in connection with such facility and

establish the Cosmo CMO in accordance with the preceding sentence by the Cosmo
CMO Deadline, (a) Salix shall no longer be required to purchase its
requirements of any Product from Cosmo and (b) Salix shall have the right to
enter into arrangements with one or more Third Parties to act as additional

royalty-free, non-exclusive basis, such licenses, and provide to such Third
Party manufacturer (or Salix or its Affiliate), free of charge, such
technical assistance as such Third Party manufacturer (or Salix or its
Affiliate) may require in order to Manufacture the Products to the then-
current Manufacturing process(es) for the Products.

other governmental body of a country or any political subdivision thereof of
competent jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Receiving Party
shall first have given notice to the Disclosing Party and given the Disclosing
Party a reasonable opportunity to quash such order or to obtain a protective
order requiring that the Confidential Information or documents that are the
subject of such order be held in confidence by such court or governmental body
or, if disclosed, be used only for the purposes for which the order was

(c) To the extent, if any, that a Party concludes in good faith that it is
required by applicable laws or regulations to file or register this Agreement
or a notification thereof with any governmental authority, including the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, such Party may do so, and the other Party

filing Party shall request confidential treatment of sensitive provisions of
the Agreement, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and in consultation

any information by the Receiving Party in violation of this Agreement will
cause severe and irreparable damage to the Disclosing Party. In the event of
any violation of this ARTICLE V, the Receiving Party agrees that the

its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the
"Salix Indemnified Parties"), and defend and hold each of them harmless, from
and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements)
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by any of them in connection with (a) any
and all suits, actions, investigations, claims or demands of Third Parties
(collectively, all "Third Party Claims") arising from or occurring as a
result of (i) the breach by Cosmo of any of its representations or warranties
set forth in this Agreement, (ii) Cosmos breach of any covenant, undertaking
or other term contained in this Agreement, (iii) Cosmos negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of this Agreement, or (iv) the storage,
release, or disposal of any hazardous or regulated material or any waste by
Cosmo, or (b) the enforcement by Salix of its rights under this Section 7.1,
except, in each case, for those Losses for which Salix has an obligation to
indemnify the Cosmo Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.2, as to which
Losses each Party shall indemnify the other Party to the extent of its
respective liability for such Losses.

7.2 _Salix Indemnification_. Salix shall indemnify Cosmo, its Affiliates
and its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the
"Cosmo Indemnified Parties"), and defend and hold each of them harmless, from
and against any and all Losses incurred by any of them in connection with (a)
any and all Third Party Claims arising from or occurring as a result of (i)
the breach by Salix of any of its representations or warranties set forth in
this Agreement, or (ii) Salixs breach of any covenant, undertaking or other
term contained in this Agreement, or (b) the enforcement by Cosmo of its
rights under this Section 7.2, except, in each case, for those Losses for
which Cosmo has an obligation to indemnify the Salix Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 7.1, as to which Losses each Party shall indemnify the
other Party to the extent of its respective liability for such Losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained herein to the contrary,
Salix shall have no liability for, and Cosmo shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Salix Indemnified Parties, from and against,

 



-25-  any and all Losses, whenever asserted, arising out of or relating to any
contract, license, agreement, arrangement, claim or understanding (whether
written or oral) existing as of the Effective Date to which Cosmo, Salix, or
any of their respective Affiliates is a party and which would be violated by
any direct or indirect assignment, transfer, licensing, sale, pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation, or other disposition, or any Exploitation, of any
Product.

7.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) _Notice of Claim_. The indemnified party (the "Indemnified Party") shall
give the indemnifying Party (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice
(an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of any Losses or discovery of facts upon
which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification
under Section 7.1 or 7.2, but in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice.
Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and
the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount
of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish
promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents
received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.

(b) _Third Party Claims_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this
Article VII with respect to any Third Party Claim shall be governed by and be
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

(i) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party
Claim by the Indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment
that the Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in
respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the
Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against any Indemnified
Partys claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of
the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party,
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall immediately deliver to the Indemnifying Party all
original notices and documents (including court papers) received by any
Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Subject to clause
(ii) below, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.
In the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is
not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless a Salix Indemnified Party
or Cosmo Indemnified Party, as applicable, from and against the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of
suit) and any Losses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in its defense of the
Third Party Claim with respect to such Salix Indemnified Party or Cosmo
Indemnified Party, as applicable.

 



-26- (ii) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 7.3(b)(i), any
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that such employment shall be at the
Indemnified Partys own expense unless (A) the employment thereof has been
specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, (B) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in
accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i) (in which case the Indemnified Party shall
control the defense), or (C) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently
adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both parties
under applicable law, ethical rules or equitable principles.

(iii) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment
of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not
result in the Indemnified Partys becoming subject to injunctive or other
relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in
any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in
writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of
any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on
such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem
appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party
Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i), the Indemnifying Party shall
have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any
settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; _provided_ that it obtains the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an
Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or dispose of, any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(iv) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony,
provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal business hours
afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the
Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees and agents available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse
the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith.

 



-27- (v) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs
and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed
on a calendar quarter basis in arrears by the Indemnifying Party, without
prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys right to contest the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the
Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party.

 

7.4 _Insurance_.

(a) During the Term, each Party shall maintain (i) comprehensive general
liability insurance with a combined single limit for bodily injury and
property damage of not less than Five Million United States Dollars
($5,000,000.00) and (ii) product liability/completed operations coverage with
a per claim limit of not less than Two Million United States Dollars
($2,000,000.00) (collectively, the "Policies"). If any Policy is written on a
claims-made basis, the retroactive date, if any, shall be not be later than
the Effective Date. In addition, such coverage shall be continued for a period
of five (5) years following the Term. Each Party shall provide prompt notice
to the other Party in the event that the first Partys Policies are canceled
or subjected to a reduction of coverage or any other material adverse
modification.

(b) Each Party shall furnish certificates of insurance for its Policies to
the other Party within ten (10) days after the Effective Date.

event the suspension of performance continues for sixty (60) days after the
date of the occurrence, and such failure to perform would constitute a
material breach of this Agreement in the absence of such force majeure
event, the nonaffected Party may terminate this Agreement immediately by
written notice to the affected Party.

8.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, together with the
Schedules attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations,
whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. Each
Party confirms that it is not relying on any representations or warranties of
the other Party except as specifically set forth herein. No amendment,
modification, release or discharge shall be binding upon the Parties unless in
writing and duly executed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

 

8.4 _Further Assurances_. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause
to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause
to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such
assignments, agreements, documents and instruments as may be necessary or as
the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to
carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof or to better
assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this
Agreement.

 

8.5 _Successors and Assigns_. The terms and provisions hereof shall inure to
the benefit of, and be binding upon, Salix, Cosmo and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

8.6 _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of a dispute between the Parties,
either Party may, by giving written notice of dispute to the other Party,
request a meeting of authorized representatives of the Parties for the purpose
of resolving the dispute. The Parties agree that, within thirty (30) days
after any such request, each Party shall designate a representative to
participate in dispute resolution discussions that shall be held at a mutually
acceptable time and place for the purpose of resolving the dispute. Each Party
agrees to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute in a mutually
acceptable manner. If for whatever reason the Parties are unable to resolve
the dispute within sixty (60) days after the issuance of a notice of dispute,
then either Party may, by written notice to the other Party, submit the
dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 8.6.

(a) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the
breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce as then in effect ("ICC Rules"), _provided_
, that in the event and to the extent

 



-30-  such rules conflict with the terms of this Section 8.6, the terms of this
Section 8.6 shall govern. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s)
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of
arbitration shall be Dublin, Ireland. The arbitration shall be conducted in
the English language.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 8.6(c), the arbitration shall be held before
a single arbitrator, who shall be selected by agreement of the Parties, or,
if the Parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after commencement of
arbitration, then by the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC"). The
arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.6(b) shall be a practicing or
retired lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience
relating to agreements concerning the Manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical
products for the Territory.

 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 8.6(b), in the event that the dispute that is
subject to arbitration is one in which a Party seeks to recover an amount of
at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) from the other Party, then either
Party shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to the other Party
given at any time within ten (10) days after commencement of arbitration,
to require that the arbitration be held before a panel of three (3)
arbitrators. In such case, within thirty (30) days after the provision of
notice described in the preceding sentence, each Party shall select one person
to act as arbitrator. If a Party shall fail within the designated time period
to select an arbitrator, then the arbitrator to be selected by the Party shall
be selected by the ICC. The two (2) persons so selected as arbitrators shall
select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment. If
the two (2) initially selected arbitrators are unable or fail to agree upon
the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the ICC. Each
arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.6(c) shall be a practicing
lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible, have experience relating
to agreements concerning the Manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical
products.

 

(d) Each Party shall, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly
provide the other Party with copies of documents relevant to the issues
raised by the dispute on which the producing Party may rely in support of, or
in opposition to, any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or
the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator(s),
which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed
within forty five (45) days following the appointment of the arbitrator(s).

 

(e) It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances,
arbitration proceedings will be concluded within six (6) months from the date
the arbitrator is appointed (or, where a panel of three (3) arbitrators is
used, the date upon which the third arbitrator is appointed). The
arbitrator(s) may extend this time limit in the interests of justice. Failure
to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the
award.

 



-31- (f) Except as may be required by Applicable Law (including applicable
securities laws or rules of a securities exchange) or as may be necessary to
enforce the arbitration award or the provisions of this Section 8.6, and
except for disclosures made by a Party to its accountants, insurers,
consultants, or attorneys or to actual or potential lenders, non-public
investors, rating agencies, acquirors, or business partners who are under
obligations to the disclosing Party to hold the disclosed information in
confidence, neither a Party nor its representatives may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

(g) The arbitrator(s) shall have discretion to allocate the Parties costs
and expenses for the arbitration (including attorneys fees), the fees of the
arbitrator(s), and the administrative fees of arbitration between the Parties
in proportion to the extent to which they prevail. Failing such allocation,
each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the
fees of the arbitrators and administrative fees of the arbitration.

 

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of Ireland, excluding any conflicts or choice of law
rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of
this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. The Parties
agree to exclude the application to this Agreement of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

8.8 _Audits_.

 

(a) Each Party shall have the right to have an independent certified public
accounting firm of internationally recognized standing, and reasonably
acceptable to the other Party, provided with access by such other Party during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable prior written notice, to examine
only those records of such other Party (and its Affiliates and sublicensees)
as may be reasonably necessary to determine, with respect to any Calendar
Year ending not more than three (3) years prior to the auditing Partys
request, the correctness or completeness of any payment made or statement or
invoice submitted under this Agreement. Such examinations may not (i) be
conducted more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless a previous
audit during such twelve (12) month period revealed an underpayment with
respect to such period or an incorrect statement submitted by the audited
Party in respect of such period or the audited Party restates or revises such
books and records for such period) or (ii) be repeated for any Calendar Year.
Results of such audit shall (i) be (A) limited to information relating to the
Products (including with respect to COGS), (B) made available to both Parties
in writing, and (C) subject to ARTICLE V and (ii) not reveal any specific
information of the audited Party to the auditing Party other than (A) whether
the audited Party is in compliance with its payment obligations under this
Agreement or whether statements or invoices submitted by the audited Party
under this Agreement are true and correct, as the case may be, and (B) the
amount of any additional payments owed or excess payments made or any
correction to statements or invoices submitted by the audited Party under this
Agreement, as the case may be. Except as provided below, the cost of this
examination shall be borne by the auditing Party, unless the audit reveals a
variance of more than five percent (5%) from the reported or invoiced amounts,
in which case the audited Party shall bear the cost of the audit. Unless
disputed pursuant to

 



-32-  Section 8.8(b), if such audit concludes that additional payments were owed
or that excess payments were made during such period, the applicable Party
shall make such additional payments or reimburse such excess payments to the
other Party within sixty (60) days after the date on which such auditors
written report is delivered to the Parties. In addition, if (1) Cosmo is
required to reimburse excess payments to Salix as a result of the
overstatement by Cosmo of the Clinical Supply Price or Sample Supply Price,
Cosmo shall pay interest on such excess payment as provided in Section 8.9
from the date of original payment by Salix, or (2) Salix is required to make
an additional payment to Cosmo as a result of the understatement by Salix of
the Average Actual Price, Salix shall pay interest on such additional payment
as provided in Section 8.9 from the date originally due.

 

(b) In the event of a dispute of any audit under Section 8.8(a), Cosmo and
Salix shall work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. If the Parties
are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute
within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 8.6.

 

8.9 _Payments_.

__(a) All payments to be made by one Party to the other (the " __Payee __")
under this Agreement shall be paid by bank wire transfer or by automated
clearinghouse (electronic funds transfer) in immediately available funds to
such bank account designated in writing by the Payee from time to time;
_provided_ that Salix shall be entitled to set off against any payment due to
Cosmo hereunder any payment due from Cosmo to Salix hereunder. Time for
payment shall be of the essence. Unless the paying Party notifies the Payee
in writing of a good faith dispute with respect to amounts not paid when due,
interest shall accrue thereon at the rate of prime plus one percent (1%), such
interest to begin accruing on a daily basis from the date payment is due;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a good faith dispute regarding
payment that is resolved to be due and is not paid within three (3) business
days after such resolution, interest shall accrue on any amount overdue at
the rate of prime plus one percent (1%), such interest to begin accruing on a
daily basis from the date such payment becomes overdue. For purposes of this
Agreement, the rate of prime shall be that rate of prime quoted by Citibank,
N.A., New York, New York, or any successor entity thereto. __

(b) All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or
withholding for or on account of any taxes, duties, levies, or other charges
unless such deduction or withholding is required by Applicable Law to be
assessed against the payee. Salix shall consult in good faith with Cosmos
tax advisors (whose fees shall be borne solely by Cosmo) prior to deducting or
withholding any amounts as aforesaid. If the payor of any such payment is so
required to make any deduction or withholding from payments due to the
payee, the payor shall (i) promptly notify the payee of such requirement,
(ii) pay to the relevant authorities on payees behalf the full amount
required to be deducted or withheld promptly upon the earlier of determining
that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such
amount has been assessed against the payee, and (iii) promptly forward to
payee an official receipt (or certified copy) or other documentation
reasonably acceptable to payee evidencing such payment to such authorities.

 



-33- __(c) All payments under this Agreement shall be made in United States
Dollars. Any amount or charge necessary for determining any amount payable
hereunder that is received or incurred in a currency other than United States
Dollars shall be translated into United States Dollars at the average daily
purchase price for United States Dollars using the relevant currency during
the most recently ended Calendar Quarter prior to the date of the relevant
transaction, using for such purpose daily purchase prices as reported in the
_Wall Street Journal_ as published for the New York City market. __

8.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as giving any Person, other than the Parties hereto and their successors and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

 

8.11 _Export Control_. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions
concerning the export of products or technical information from the United
States or other countries that may be imposed on the Parties from time to
time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any
technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or
any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner
that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental
approval, without first obtaining the written consent to do so from the
appropriate agency or other governmental entity in accordance with Applicable
Law.

8.12 _Assignment_. Except as expressly provided herein, neither Party
may, without the prior written consent of the other Party, sell, transfer,
assign, delegate, pledge, subcontract or otherwise dispose of, whether
voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement
or any of its rights or duties hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
Salix may, without such consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate or to the purchaser or sublicensee of
Salixs rights in and to the Products or any Product, (b) Cosmo may, without
such consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder
to one or more Affiliates, and (c) either Party may, without such consent,
assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to the
purchaser of all or substantially all of its assets or to any successor entity
or acquirer in the event of a merger, consolidation or change in control of
such Party. Any attempt to assign, transfer, subcontract or delegate any
portion of this Agreement in violation of this Section shall be null and void.
All validly assigned and delegated rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by and against the successors and permitted assigns of Salix or Cosmo, as the
case may be. In the event either Party assigns or delegates its rights or
obligations to another Person in accordance with the terms hereof, the
assignee or transferee shall assume all obligations of its assignor or
transferor under this Agreement and the assignor or transferor shall cease to
be a party to this Agreement and shall cease to have any rights or obligations
under this Agreement from and after the effective date of such assignment. No
such assignment or delegation shall relieve the assignor or transferor of any
of its obligations hereunder.

 



-34-  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cosmo shall have the right, from time to time
and without the necessity of providing notice to or obtaining the consent of
Salix, to delegate, assign, or subcontract to any of its Affiliates Cosmos
rights or responsibilities under this Agreement. In all cases, Cosmo shall
remain the contract Party under this Agreement and shall remain responsible to
Salix for the performance of all such obligations under this Agreement.

8.13 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by either
Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

 

8.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights
or obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and reasonably
acceptable to the Parties herein. __

8.15 _Independent Contractors_. The status of the Parties under this
Agreement shall be that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, agency, employer,
employee, or joint venture relationship between the Parties. Neither Party
shall have the right to enter into any agreements on behalf of the other
Party, nor shall it represent to any Person that it has any such right or
authority.

 

8.16 _Construction_. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires:
(a) words of any gender include each other gender; (b) words using the
singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and derivative or
similar words refer to this entire Agreement; (d) the terms "Article,"

describe, extend, or limit the scope or intent of this Agreement or the intent
of any provision contained in this Agreement. The language of this Agreement

of strict construction shall be applied against either Party.

8.17 _Remedies_. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and
do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by applicable law or
otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.

 

8.18 _Counterparts; Facsimile Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this

RIGHT OF NEGOTIATION AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

 

between

Cosmo Pharmaceuticals S.p.A.

and

 

Salix Pharmaceuticals, plc

 

Dated [ _ _], 2014 RIGHT OF NEGOTIATION AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

 

THIS RIGHT OF NEGOTIATION AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "),
entered into as of [ ], 2014 (the " _Effective Date_ "), is made
by and between Cosmo Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., an Italian public corporation (
_societ a per azioni_) (" _Cosmo_ "), and Salix Pharmaceuticals, plc, a
public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland (" _Salix_ ").
Cosmo and Salix are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "
_Parties_ " or individually as a " _Party_ ".

BACKGROUND

 

A. Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (" _Old_ _Salix_ "), Cosmo, Salix, and
Sangiovese, LLC are parties to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, dated as of July 8, 2014 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Old Salix acquired Salix, with Salix in connection with such
transaction retaining certain rights and assets with respect to the Covered
Products in the applicable Salix Territory.

B. In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Cosmos subsidiary Cosmo Technologies (Two) Ltd. and Salix
have entered into that certain License and Collaboration Agreement, of even
date herewith (the " _License and Collaboration Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which the parties thereto will collaborate with respect to the development
and commercialization of the Covered Products.

C. In consideration of Old Salix and Salix entering into the Merger Agreement
and performing their obligations thereunder and Salix entering into the
License and Collaboration Agreement and performing its obligations thereunder,
Cosmo is willing to agree to the obligations and to provide Salix the rights
set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and
conditions hereinafter set forth and set forth in the Merger Agreement and the
License and Collaboration Agreement, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

Section 1.01 _Definitions_. Unless otherwise specified herein,
all capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the License and Collaboration Agreement, or
if not defined in the License and Collaboration Agreement, in the Merger
Agreement.

 

Section 1.02 _Term_. This Agreement shall take effect as of the Effective Date
and, unless terminated earlier by mutual written agreement of the Parties,
shall expire upon the expiration or earlier termination of the License and
Collaboration Agreement (the " _Term_ ").

 

Section 1.03 _Development Information_. From time to time, upon Salixs
written request (such requests not to be given by Salix more frequently than
once every six months), Cosmo shall, subject to any confidentiality
obligations to Third Parties, in good faith, provide Salix or its designee
with up to date, complete and accurate information in respect of all
diagnostic products, pharmaceutical compounds and products, and medical
devices in the Field  (as defined herein) then being developed by Cosmo or any of its Affiliates
(other than Covered Products), including reasonably detailed summaries of all
pre-clinical and clinical data with respect to each such compound, product or
medical device. Such information shall be deemed to be Cosmos Confidential
Information. The provisions of this Section 1.03 shall expire and cease to
apply upon the occurrence of a Board Right Termination Event (as defined in
the Shareholders Agreement).

Section 1.04 _Salix s Right of Negotiation for Additional Products_.

(a) In the event that Cosmo or any of its Affiliates has a good faith intent
to develop or commercialize in or for the United States, whether by itself or
themselves or with or through a Third Party, a diagnostic product,
pharmaceutical compound or product, or medical device in the Field other than
a Covered Product, including any diagnostic product, pharmaceutical compound
or product, or medical device in the Field in-licensed or acquired by Cosmo or
any of its Affiliates from a Third Party (an " _Additional Product_ "), Cosmo
shall notify Salix in writing (an " _Additional Product Opportunity Notice_
") and Salix shall have a non-exclusive right of negotiation with respect to
such Additional Product as set forth in this Section 1.04. Such right shall be
exercisable by Salix by written notice (an " _Additional Product Opportunity
Negotiation Notice_ ") given to Cosmo not later than 15 days after delivery of
Cosmos Additional Product Opportunity Notice (the " _Additional Product
Opportunity Notice Period_ "). For clarity, the provision of an Additional
Product Opportunity Notice with respect to an Additional Product by Cosmo
shall not limit Cosmos obligation to provide a Transaction Opportunity Notice
with respect to such Additional Product to the extent required by Section
1.05 below.

(b) Following Salixs delivery of an Additional Product Opportunity
Negotiation Notice to Cosmo in accordance with clause (a) above, the Parties
shall negotiate on a non-exclusive basis in good faith for a period of 45 days
(or such longer period as may be agreed in writing by the Parties) (the "
_Discussion Period_ ") to try to reach agreement upon the terms and conditions
upon which Salix shall obtain a license or other rights to the applicable
Additional Product in and for the United States. In connection with
the Parties good faith negotiations regarding an Additional Product, Cosmo
shall provide to Salix such data and information with respect to such
Additional Product as Salix may reasonably request.

 

(c) With respect to an Additional Product for which Cosmo delivered an
Additional Product Opportunity Notice and Salix timely delivered an
Additional Product Opportunity Negotiation Notice, if the Parties are unable
to conclude an agreement by the end of the applicable Discussion Period, then,
subject to the provisions of Section 1.06, Cosmo and its
Affiliates thereafter shall be free from and after the end of such Additional
Product Opportunity Notice Period to pursue development and commercialization
of the Additional Product in and for the United States; _provided_ that Cosmo
shall be obligated to deliver a Transaction Opportunity Notice with respect
to such Additional Product in accordance with Section 1.05 below to the extent
applicable.

 



2 (d) The provisions of this Section 1.04 shall expire and cease to apply
upon the occurrence of a Board Right Termination Event. Any such expiration,
however, shall be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the
Parties in respect of any Additional Product Opportunity Notice that may have
been given (or have been required to have been given) before the date of
expiration.

Section 1.05 _Salix s Right of Refusal for Additional Products_.

(a) In the event that Cosmo or any of its Affiliates desires to enter into a
license or other agreement with a Third Party (including a sale) with respect
to the development or commercialization of an Additional Product in and for
the United States (a " _Transaction_ "), Cosmo shall notify Salix in writing
and set forth all material terms and conditions of the proposed Transaction
(a " _Transaction Opportunity Notice_ ") and Salix shall have 30 days after
delivery of such Transaction Opportunity Notice (the " _Transaction
Opportunity Acceptance Period_ ") to enter, either itself or through its
Affiliates, into definitive agreements with Cosmo or any of its Affiliates for
the proposed Transaction containing the same material terms and conditions as
those provided in the Transaction Opportunity Notice and such other standard
terms as are mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and Cosmo or its Affiliate,
as the case may be, must enter into such definitive agreements for such
Transaction with Salix (or its designated Affiliate(s)) if the terms are
the same as those provided in the Transaction Opportunity Notice (and such
other standard terms as are mutually agreed upon by the Parties).

 

(b) If Cosmo or any of its Affiliates and Salix (or its designated
Affiliate(s)) fail to enter into such definitive agreements within the
Transaction Opportunity Acceptance Period, then Cosmo shall be free to
consummate the Transaction as disclosed in the Transaction Opportunity Notice
and Salix shall have no further rights in respect of such Transaction
Opportunity Notice or the Transaction. Cosmo shall not, and Cosmo shall cause
its Affiliates not to, consummate any Transaction (a " _Third Party Agreement_
") without first having complied with the provisions of this Section 1.05. For
the avoidance of doubt, Cosmo shall not enter into any Third Party Agreement
in respect of an Additional Product for which Cosmo delivered a Transaction
Opportunity Notice prior to the end of the Transaction Opportunity Acceptance
Period.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 1.05 shall expire and cease to apply upon
the occurrence of a Board Right Termination Event. Any such expiration,
however, shall be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the
Parties in respect of any Transaction Opportunity Notice that may have been
given (or have been required to have been given) before the date
of expiration.

Section 1.06 _Cosmo Non-Compete_. Cosmo, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, agrees that as of and following the Effective Time and until such
time as a Board Right Termination Event shall have occurred, neither it nor
any of its Affiliates shall, either directly or indirectly, alone or with
others,

 

(a) themselves engage in any Competing Business, or

 



3 (b) own or have the right to acquire an interest in (whether as a
stockholder, member or partner, but in each case excluding any such interest
not exceeding 10% of any class of security that is listed and traded on any
national or international securities exchange or 20% of the aggregate
outstanding voting or aggregate outstanding economic equity interest in any
Person none of whose securities are listed on a national or international
securities exchange), or manage, operate, or control, or participate in or be
connected with as a director, any Person engaged in a Competing Business.

For purposes hereof, the term " _Competing Business_ " means any business,
venture or activity that engages in selling, marketing or distributing in the
United States any diagnostic product, pharmaceutical compound or product, or
medical device in the Field, including any diagnostic product, pharmaceutical
compound or product, or medical device in-licensed or acquired by Cosmo or
any of its Affiliates from a Third Party, for use, alone or in combination
with any other product, in the Field. For purposes hereof, the term " _Field_
" means a use in the treatment, amelioration, diagnosis, management or
prevention of any gastrointestinal disease or disorder (including the
following: hepatic encephalopathy, opioid-induced constipation, ulcerative
colitis, fecal incontinence, cleaning of colon as preparation for
colonoscopy, travelers diarrhea, diarrhea, gastroparesis, gastroesophageal
reflux disease, ulcers, erosive esophagitis, stomach bleeding, inflammatory
bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, diverticulosis, or
celiac disease) or the preparation for or conducting of any gastrointestinal
procedure, whether for the treatment, amelioration, diagnosis, management or
prevention of any gastrointestinal disease or disorder or otherwise.

 

(c) For clarity, the provisions of this Section 1.06 shall expire and cease to
apply upon the occurrence of a Board Right Termination Event.

Section 1.07 _Nondisclosure and Non-Use_.

 

(a) Salix, on the one hand, and Cosmo, on the other hand, each agrees that
during the Term, and for a period of ten (10) years thereafter, it will keep
confidential, and will cause its employees, agent, consultants, licensees and
sublicensees to keep confidential, all Confidential Information (as defined
below) of the other that is disclosed to it, or to any of its employees,
agents, consultants, licensees or sublicensees pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement, except to the extent that disclosure is required or
permitted in accordance with the performance of this Agreement. Neither Salix
nor any of its employees, agents, consultants, licensees or sublicensees
shall use Confidential Information of Cosmo for any purpose except as
expressly permitted in this Agreement or except as expressly authorized by
Cosmo. Neither Cosmo nor any of its employees, agents, consultants, licensees
or sublicensees shall use Confidential Information of Salix for any purpose
except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or except as expressly
authorized by Salix. Salix, on the one hand, and Cosmo, on the other hand,
each covenants that each of its employees, agents, consultants, licensees and
sublicensees who shall have access to Confidential Information of the other
are bound by written obligations or are obligated under professional
ethical rules to maintain such information in confidence and not to use such

in electronic, tangible, oral or visual form; _provided_ , that oral or visual
disclosures shall be deemed confidential only if they are confirmed as
confidential in writing by the disclosing Party prior to or at the time of
disclosure or within sixty (60) days thereafter or if the other Party should
reasonably know that such visual or oral disclosures were intended to
be confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information
shall not include such information that: (i) as of the date of disclosure is
known to the Party receiving such disclosure or its Affiliates, as shown by
written documentation, other than by virtue of a prior confidential

the date of disclosure is in, or subsequently enters, the public domain,
through no fault or omission of the Party receiving such disclosure; or (iii)
as of the date of disclosure or thereafter is obtained from a Third Party free

that is otherwise Confidential Information and consists of a combination of
information shall not be deemed to be in the public domain if individual
elements of such information are in the public domain, unless the specific
combination of those elements is also in the public domain.

 

(b) Salix may disclose Confidential Information of Cosmo to the extent that
such disclosure is in response to a valid order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or other governmental authority or, if in the reasonable opinion
of Salixs legal counsel, such disclosure is otherwise required by Applicable
Law; _provided_ , that Salix shall first have given notice to Cosmo and given
Cosmo a reasonable opportunity to quash such order or to obtain a protective
order or confidential treatment requiring that the Confidential Information
and documents that are the subject of such order or requirement be held
in confidence by such court or agency or, if disclosed, be used only for the
purposes for which the order was issued; _provided, further_ , that the
Confidential Information of Cosmo disclosed in response to such court or
governmental order or Applicable Law shall be limited to that information
which is legally required to be disclosed in response to such court or
governmental order or Applicable Law to request confidential treatment
thereof.

 

(c) Cosmo may disclose Confidential Information of Salix to the extent that

5 Section 1.08 _Terms of this Agreement_. Except as otherwise specifically set
forth in Section 1.07, without the prior written consent of Salix, Cosmo
shall not disclose any terms or conditions of this Agreement to any Third
Party nor make any statement to the public (including any press release)
regarding the execution or any other aspect of the subject matter of this
Agreement, and without the prior written consent of Cosmo, Salix shall not
disclose any terms or conditions of this Agreement to any Third Party nor make
any statement to the public (including any press release) regarding the

Law or stock exchange rules or regulations and, to the extent practical,
Cosmo, on the one hand, or Salix, on the other hand, is provided with the
opportunity sufficiently in advance of disclosure to review such information
and seek confidential treatment therefor; (b) for customary discussions and
other disclosures with and to shareholders, current or prospective investors,
potential acquirers, potential licensees, merger partners or potential

respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings,
promises and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto
are superseded hereby. Salix confirms that it is not relying on any

or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof or to

Section 1.13 _Successors and Assigns_. The terms and provisions hereof shall
inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, Salix and Cosmo and their

Section 1.14 _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of a dispute between Salix,
on the one hand, and Cosmo, on the other hand, either Salix or Cosmo may, by
giving written notice of dispute to the other, request a meeting of authorized
representatives of the Parties for the purpose of resolving the dispute.
The Parties agree that, within thirty (30) days after any such request,
Salix, on the one hand, and Cosmo, on the other hand, shall designate a
representative to participate in dispute resolution discussions that shall be
held at a mutually acceptable time and place for the purpose of resolving the
dispute. Each Party agrees to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute
in a mutually acceptable manner. If for whatever reason the Parties are unable
to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days after the issuance of a notice
of dispute, then either Salix or Cosmo may, by written notice to the other,
submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 1.14.

 



8 (a) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including
the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce as then in effect (" _ICC Rules_ ");
_provided_ , that in the event and to the extent such rules conflict with the
terms of this Section 1.14, the terms of this Section 1.14 shall govern.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be Dublin,
Ireland. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

(b) Except as provided in Section 1.14(c), the arbitration shall be held
before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected by agreement of Salix and
Cosmo, or, if Salix and Cosmo cannot agree within thirty (30) days after
commencement of arbitration, then by the International Chamber of Commerce ("
_ICC_ "). The arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 1.14(b) shall be a
practicing or retired lawyer or retired judge and, to the extent possible,
have experience relating to agreements concerning the global development and
commercialization of pharmaceutical products.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 1.14(b), in the event that the dispute that is
subject to arbitration is one in which Salix, on the one hand, or Cosmo, on
the other hand, seeks to recover an amount of at least one million Dollars
($1,000,000) from the other, then either Salix or Cosmo shall have the
option, exercisable by written notice to the other given at any time within
ten (10) days after commencement of arbitration, to require that the
arbitration be held before a panel of three (3) arbitrators. In such case,
within thirty (30) days after the provision of notice described in the
preceding sentence, Salix, on the one hand, and Cosmo, on the other hand,
shall each select one person to act as arbitrator. If either Salix or Cosmo
shall fail within the designated time period to select an arbitrator, then the
arbitrator to be selected by such Party shall be selected by the ICC. The two
(2) persons so selected as arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator within
thirty (30) days of their appointment. If the two (2) initially selected
arbitrators are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third
arbitrator shall be selected by the ICC. Each arbitrator selected pursuant to
this Section 1.14(c) shall be a practicing lawyer or retired judge and, to
the extent possible, have experience relating to agreements concerning the
global development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products.

 

(d) Each of Salix, on the one hand, and Cosmo, on the other hand, shall, upon
the written request of the other, promptly provide the other with copies of
documents relevant to the issues raised by the dispute on which the producing
Party may rely in support of, or in opposition to, any claim or defense. Any
dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be
determined by the arbitrator(s), which determination shall be conclusive. All
discovery shall be completed within forty five (45) days following the
appointment of the arbitrator(s).

 



9 (e) It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary
circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within six (6)
months from the date the arbitrator is appointed (or, where a panel of three
(3) arbitrators is used, the date upon which the third arbitrator is
appointed). The arbitrator(s) may extend this time limit in the interests of
justice. Failure to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for
challenging the award.

 

(f) Except as may be required by Applicable Law (including applicable
securities laws or rules of a securities exchange) or as may be necessary to
enforce the arbitration award or the provisions of this Section 1.14, and
except for disclosures made by a Party to its accountants, insurers,
consultants, or attorneys or to actual or potential lenders, non-
public investors, rating agencies, acquirors, or business partners who are
under obligations to the disclosing Party to hold the disclosed information in
confidence, (a) neither Salix nor its representatives may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of Cosmo and (b) neither Cosmo nor its representatives may
disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder
without the prior written consent of Salix.

(g) The arbitrator(s) shall have discretion to allocate the Parties costs and
expenses for the arbitration (including attorneys fees), the fees of the
arbitrator(s), and the administrative fees of arbitration between the Parties
in proportion to the extent to which they prevail. Failing such allocation,
each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the
fees of the arbitrators and administrative fees of the arbitration.

Section 1.15 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of Ireland, excluding any conflicts or
choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or
interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another
jurisdiction.

Section 1.16 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as giving any Person, other than the Parties hereto and their
successors and permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

 

Section 1.17 _Assignment_.

 

(a) Without the prior written consent of Salix, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, Cosmo shall not sell,
transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of, whether voluntarily,
involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any of its
rights or duties hereunder; _provided_ , that Cosmo may assign or

(c) A Third Party that merges or consolidates with a Party or an Affiliate of
a Party, or to which a Party or an Affiliate of a Party transfers all or

deemed to grant under this Agreement any license to such Third Partys
technology in existence as of the effective date of such merger,
consolidation or transfer, unless such grant is made pursuant to a separate
agreement.

(d) Any purported assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 1.17
shall be void _ab initio_ and of no force or effect.

 

(e) For purposes of this Section 1.17, " _Majority Controlled Affiliate_ "
means, with respect to a Party, any Person that owns, directly or indirectly,
more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities, or other
voting ownership interest, of such Party; any Person of which a Party owns,

interest, of such Person.

 

Section 1.18 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived
at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No

or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully severable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to

threatened breach of any such provision by Salix, Cosmo shall be authorized
and entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive

consideration of the public interest or inadequacy of monetary damages as a
remedy. Nothing in this Section is intended, or should be construed, to limit
a Partys right to equitable relief or any other remedy for a breach of any
other provision of this Agreement.

---|---|--- 



     | d. | initiate or make a proposal for any scheme of arrangement,

(other than, in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders Agreement) or
seek a change in the composition or size of the Board;

regulation, make or cause to be made any press release or similar public
announcement or public communication relating to the way a Shareholder intends

approval of any shareholder proposal or solicit proxies or consents, or in any
way participate in, directly or indirectly, any "solicitation" of "proxies"

Voting Securities, or become a "participant" in a "solicitation" (as such
terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, as in effect on
the date of the Shareholders Agreement, whether or not such regulation is
applicable to the Company) with respect to any Voting Securities;

foregoing;

termination pursuant to Section 4.1(c) of the Shareholders Agreement;

the Shareholders Agreement; _provided _,_ further_, that such reinstatement
shall not prevent Cosmo Holding from continuing to pursue any activities
described in Section 1 above that were definitively commenced after the date
of such termination, but prior to the date of such reinstatement.  
---|--- 



   3. | _Remedies_ : Cosmo Holding acknowledges that it would be
impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this letter agreement and that the remedy
at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would
be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the Company shall, in addition to
any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to such equitable
and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain Cosmo Holding from
violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or proceeding
for injunctive relief, Cosmo Holding hereby waives the claim or defense that
a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted
by law, to have each provision of this letter agreement specifically enforced
against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security against
it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against it enjoining or
restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of this letter
agreement.

Trial by Jury_. THIS LETTER AGREEMENT AND ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH IT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER OR FORMATION INCLUDING NON-
CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF IRELAND. Each of Cosmo Holding and the Company
irrevocably agrees that the courts of Ireland are to have exclusive
jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts. Any proceeding, suit or action arising out of or
in connection with this letter agreement (" _Proceedings_ ") shall therefore
be brought in the courts of Ireland. Solely in connection with claims arising
under this letter agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
letter agreement, each of Cosmo Holding and the Company irrevocably (i) waives
any objection to Proceedings in the courts of Ireland on the grounds of venue
or on the grounds of  _forum non conveniens_ ; and (ii) agrees that service
of process upon such Person in any such Proceeding shall be effective if
notice is given to (A) in the case of Cosmo Holding, Piazza della Repubblica
3, Milano, (MI) 20121, Italy, and (B) in the case of the Company, 8510
Colonnade Center Drive, Raleigh, NC 27615. EACH OF COSMO HOLDING AND THE
COMPANY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.



   4. | _General_ :

benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

-2- Section 3\. _Consents; Assignment; Litigation_.

 

(a) Commencing on the date of this Agreement, Cosmo shall take or cause to be
taken all action, and do or cause to be done all things necessary,
appropriate or advisable, to obtain or cause to be obtained, as promptly as
possible after the date of this Agreement, all such consents, approvals,
ratifications, waivers and other authorizations as are necessary for Salix to
transfer or assign to or as directed by Cosmo each of the License Agreements
and the License Agreement IP, which assignment or transfer shall be on an "as
is", "where is", "with all faults" and "without representation or warranty by
Salix" basis (collectively, the " _Assignment_ "), such that neither the
Assignment nor any aspect thereof will, directly or indirectly, contravene,
conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or give any person or
entity the right to exercise any remedy under, any contract, agreement,
arrangement or undertaking to which Salix was a party or by which any of the
assets of Salix were subject, on the Closing Date, after giving effect to the
Closing (collectively, the " _Requisite Consent_ " and, the receipt of such
Requisite Consents and the Releases, the " _Assignment Condition_ ").

 

(b) Cosmo shall deliver to Salix all Requisite Consents promptly after the
receipt thereof, together with (i) a certificate of Cosmo, duly signed by an
authorized officer of Cosmo, for and on behalf of Cosmo, certifying that the
Assignment Condition has been satisfied in all respects and (ii) the agreement
pursuant to which the License Agreements and the License Agreement IP will be
transferred or assigned.

(c) Upon satisfaction of the Assignment Condition, receipt of the items
specified in Section 3(b) and Cosmos written instruction to effect the
Assignment to the specified assignee, Salix shall promptly take all reasonable
actions to effect such Assignment, at Cosmos cost and expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, in the event that
Salix reasonably believes that any transfer or assignment of any License
Agreement or License Agreement IP to or as directed by Cosmo would violate any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or directly or indirectly contravene,
conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or give any person or
entity the right to exercise any remedy under, any contract, agreement,
arrangement or undertaking to which Salix is a party or by which it or its
property is bound, Salix shall be entitled to retain such License Agreement
or License Agreement IP until Cosmo presents a proposed assignment or transfer
thereof that would not violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or have
such effect with respect to any such contract, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking. This Agreement shall continue to apply to such License Agreement
and License Agreement IP while so retained by Salix.

 

(d) Cosmo shall take all steps necessary to be substituted for Salix as a
plaintiff in any litigation or proceeding in which Salix shall, as a result
of consummation of the transactions under the Merger Agreement, be or become a
plaintiff or other party, now or hereafter pending in respect of the License
Agreement IP in any jurisdiction. Cosmo shall not take any action to pursue
any such litigation or proceeding unless it shall first obtain a full and
irrevocable release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Salix,
of any and all liability that Salix may have at any time in connection with
any such litigation or proceeding.

 



-3- Section 4\. _Supply Requirements_.

 

(a) In the event that, prior to assignment or transfer of a License Agreement,
the licensee thereunder shall require any Product to be manufactured or
supplied or other services related to Products to be performed for such
licensee by Salix, Cosmo shall fully perform all such manufacturing, supply
and other service obligations, as Salix subcontractor, providing all
services and material (at Cosmos sole cost and expense and without any
reimbursement by, and at no cost or expense to, Salix) as are necessary to
ensure full and timely performance of all such requirements, in accordance
with acceptable production practices under the License Agreement and in full
conformity with the terms and conditions thereof and any related service and
supply agreements and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. In such
capacity, Cosmo shall perform (directly or through affiliates) on behalf of
Buyer, all Product manufacturing, supply and other services that Salix is
required to perform for such licensee and all related service and supply
contracts with such licensee. In addition, if any amount is or is determined
in any proceeding to be payable by Salix under or in respect of any such
License Agreement in connection with such Product manufacturing, supply or
other services, Cosmo shall promptly pay all such amounts and any interest
that may be due in connection therewith.

(b) Cosmo shall be responsible for negotiating and concluding any additional
agreements required to facilitate such manufacturing, supply or services,
provided that no such additional agreements shall adversely affect any
interest or right of Salix. Cosmo shall, at Salix request, communicate
directly with such licensee regarding Cosmos performance of the
manufacturing, supply and other service obligations under the License
Agreement and related service and supply agreements on behalf of Salix, and
Cosmo shall include Salix designated representatives in any
such communications. Salix authorizes Cosmo to provide directly to such
licensee on Salix behalf information and materials, including insurance
certificates, tax certificates and reports related to Product manufacturing
and supply and other services, as required by the respective License
Agreement and related service and supply agreements, provided that Cosmo shall
not provide any Confidential Information (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
of Salix or its affiliates to such licensee without Salix prior written
consent. In the event of any disputes related to the performance of Product
manufacturing, supply and other services under the License Agreement and
related service and supply agreements, Cosmo shall work in good faith to
resolve the dispute through direct discussions and escalation with the
licensees management team while keeping Salix fully informed as to the status
of the dispute, provided that the foregoing shall not constitute a waiver of
any right to enforce the obligations of Cosmo under this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement, or applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Salix
prior consent shall be required for any modification of terms and conditions
of any License Agreement if Salix reasonably believes that such modification
could adversely affect any interest or right of Salix.

(c) Cosmo shall maintain or cause to be maintained insurance (including
liability, property damage, and workers compensation coverages) reasonably
satisfactory in amount and as to carriers with respect to all manufacturing,
supply and other services that it is obligated to perform under this Section
4, naming Salix as an additional insured and loss payee as its interest may
appear, including coverage for liabilities accruing prior to, but asserted
upon or after, the Assignment.

 



-4- (d) The relationship of Cosmo to Salix is that of an independent contractor,
and under no circumstances shall Cosmo incur any debts (or make any
commitments) for Salix except with Salix prior written consent. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to create or will be construed as creating between
the parties the relationship of joint ventures, co-partners,
employer/employee or principal and agent. Salix shall have no responsibility
for the hiring, termination or compensation of Cosmos employees or
contractors or for any employee benefits of any such employee or contractor.

Section 5\. _Other License Agreement Obligations_.

 

(a) At all times prior to the Assignment, and without limiting Section 4
hereof, Cosmo shall, at its own cost and expense (and without reimbursement
from, or the incurrence of any cost or expense by, Salix) cause all
obligations under the License Agreements for which Salix (as successor in
interest to Cosmo S,p,A) may be responsible to be fully and timely performed
in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law, rules and
regulations.

Section 6\. _Indemnification_. Cosmo shall indemnify and hold harmless each
of Salix, its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates (each, an
"Indemnified Person"), from any loss, cost, expense or liability incurred by
such Indemnified Person (including any penalties) arising from or in
connection with (i) any withholding, reporting or other obligation in respect
of any Taxes relating to any License Agreement Payment or Net License
Agreement Payment covered under Section 2, (ii) any litigation or proceeding
covered under Section 3(d) and (iii) Cosmos performance or nonperformance of
its obligations under Section 4, Section 5 or Section 7, the related License
Agreements or other agreements, increased in each case to take into account
any Tax cost incurred by such Indemnified Person arising from the receipt of
any indemnification payments hereunder. The foregoing shall be without
limitation of Cosmos obligations under the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.

Section 7\. _Guarantee_. In the event that Cosmo shall from time to time
utilize one or more of its affiliates to perform Product manufacturing,
supply or other services as required pursuant to Section 4 or any of its
undertakings with respect to other License Agreement obligations under Section
5, Cosmo shall remain responsible and liable for the performance or
nonperformance thereof, and Cosmo hereby guarantees, irrevocably and
unconditionally, the due, timely and complete performance of any obligation,
duty or undertaking (including any payment) that is to be, or has
been, effected by any such affiliate, and hereby waives and agrees not to
assert any circumstance or defense that could constitute a discharge of a
guarantors or suretys obligations other than full, complete and timely
performance (and payment) of the guaranteed obligations in accordance with
the terms of the relevant agreements under which such manufacturing, supply,
services or payments are to be performed. Cosmos liability under this Section
7 will continue until all such obligations are performed in full. Cosmos
liability hereunder is as principal obligor and not merely as surety, and
Salix shall not be required to proceed against or enforce any other rights or
security or to claim payment from any person before claiming from Cosmo under
this Section 7\. In the event any amount guaranteed by Cosmo hereunder is
required to be restored to the payor as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar proceeding of any person, Cosmo shall remain liable for, and shall
pay, such amount as though the original payment had not been made.

 



-5- Section 8\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) Sections 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.10, 7.11 and 7.12 of the Shareholders Agreement
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to this Agreement.

 

(b) The rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, including the
Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification hereunder, shall be without
limitation of their rights and obligations under the Merger Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

(c) THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH IT OR
ITS SUBJECT MATTER OR FORMATION INCLUDING NON-CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF IRELAND.
Each Party irrevocably agrees that the courts of Ireland are to have
exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Any proceeding, suit or action
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement ("Proceedings") shall
therefore be brought in the courts of Ireland. Solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably (i) waives any objection to
Proceedings in the courts of Ireland on the grounds of venue or on the grounds
of _forum_ _non_ _conveniens_ ; and (ii) agrees that service of process upon
such Party in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with Section 7.5 of the Shareholders Agreement as incorporated
herein. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Dear [NAME],

Transfer of Employment from Cosmo Technologies Limited to Cosmo Technologies
(Two) Limited

Further to our previous discussions, I am writing to confirm that Cosmo
Technologies Limited is proposing to transfer certain assets of its business
to Cosmo Technologies (Two) Limited. This transfer will affect all of the
employees of Cosmo Technologies Limited. It is currently proposed that the
business transfer will take place on [DATE] on which date your employment
will transfer by operation of law to Cosmo Technologies (Two) Limited.

We believe that the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer
of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 ("the Regulations") will apply to the
proposed transfer. With effect from [DATE] your employer will be Cosmo
Technologies (Two) Limited. With the exception of pensions arrangements which
are not preserved by the Regulations and the change in the name of your
employer, the remainder of your terms and conditions of employment will remain
unchanged. Your service to date will be deemed to run from the date you
commenced employment with Cosmo Technologies Limited (or earlier, if there
have been previous transfers).

While the Regulations do not operate to automatically transfer your pensions
entitlements under the Cosmos Technologies Limited Group Retirement Plan,
Cosmo Technologies (Two) Limited will provide you with similar pension
arrangements. Details of the pensions arrangements will be explained to you.

 

You will receive a letter from Cosmo Technologies (Two) Limited confirming it
is your new employer.

 

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or require
further information.

 

Yours sincerely

[NAME]
