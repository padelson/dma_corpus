Cosmo&#146;s written instruction to effect the Assignment to the specified assignee, Salix shall promptly take all reasonable actions to effect such Assignment, at Cosmo&#146;s cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section&nbsp;3, in the event that Salix reasonably believes that any transfer or assignment of any License Agreement or License Agreement IP to or as directed by Cosmo would violate any applicable law, rule or regulation, or directly or indirectly
contravene, conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or give any person or entity the right to exercise any remedy under, any contract, agreement, arrangement or undertaking to which Salix is a party or by which it or its property is
bound, Salix shall be entitled to retain such License Agreement or License Agreement IP until Cosmo presents a proposed assignment or transfer thereof that would not violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or have such effect with respect to
any such contract, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. This Agreement shall continue to apply to such License Agreement and License Agreement IP while so retained by Salix. </P>

litigation or proceeding unless it shall first obtain a full and irrevocable release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Salix, of any and all liability that Salix may have at any time in connection with any such litigation or
proceeding. </P>

manufactured or supplied or other services related to Products to be performed for such licensee by Salix, Cosmo shall fully perform all such manufacturing, supply and other service obligations, as Salix&#146; subcontractor, providing all services
and material (at Cosmo&#146;s sole cost and expense and without any reimbursement by, and at no cost or expense to, Salix) as are necessary to ensure full and timely performance of all such requirements, in accordance with acceptable production
practices under the License Agreement and in full conformity with the terms and conditions thereof and any related service and supply agreements and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. In such capacity, Cosmo shall perform (directly or
through affiliates) on behalf of Buyer, all Product manufacturing, supply and other services that Salix is required to perform for such licensee and all related service and supply contracts with such licensee. In addition, if any amount is or is
determined in any proceeding to be payable by Salix under or in respect of any such License Agreement in connection with such Product manufacturing, supply or other services, Cosmo shall promptly pay all such amounts and any interest that may be due

performance of the manufacturing, supply and other service obligations under the License Agreement and related service and supply agreements on behalf of Salix, and Cosmo shall include Salix&#146; designated representatives in any such
communications. Salix authorizes Cosmo to provide directly to such licensee on Salix&#146; behalf information and materials, including insurance certificates, tax certificates and reports related to Product manufacturing and supply and other
services, as required by the respective License Agreement and related service and supply agreements, provided that Cosmo shall not provide any Confidential Information (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of Salix or its affiliates to such licensee
without Salix&#146; prior written consent. In the event of any disputes related to the performance of Product manufacturing, supply and other services under the License Agreement and related service and supply agreements, Cosmo shall work in good
faith to resolve the dispute through direct discussions and escalation with the licensee&#146;s management team while keeping Salix fully informed as to the status of the dispute, provided that the foregoing shall not constitute a waiver of any
right to enforce the obligations of Cosmo under this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, or applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Salix&#146; prior consent shall be required for any modification of terms and conditions of any License
Agreement if Salix reasonably believes that such modification could adversely affect any interest or right of Salix. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) Cosmo shall

from or in connection with (i)&nbsp;any withholding, reporting or other obligation in respect of any Taxes relating to any License Agreement Payment or Net License Agreement Payment covered under Section&nbsp;2, (ii)&nbsp;any litigation or

affiliates to perform Product manufacturing, supply or other services as required pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 or any of its undertakings with respect to other License Agreement obligations under Section&nbsp;5, Cosmo shall remain responsible and
liable for the performance or nonperformance thereof, and Cosmo hereby guarantees, irrevocably and unconditionally, the due, timely and complete performance of any obligation, duty or undertaking (including any payment) that is to be, or has been,
effected by any such affiliate, and hereby waives and agrees not to assert any circumstance or defense that could constitute a discharge of a guarantor&#146;s or surety&#146;s obligations other than full, complete and timely performance (and
payment) of the guaranteed obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements under which such manufacturing, supply, services or payments are to be performed. Cosmo&#146;s liability under this Section&nbsp;7 will continue until all
such obligations are performed in full. Cosmo&#146;s liability hereunder is as principal obligor and not merely as surety, and Salix shall not be required to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or to claim payment from any person
before claiming from Cosmo under this Section&nbsp;7. In the event any amount guaranteed by Cosmo hereunder is required to be restored to the payor as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding of any person, Cosmo shall remain
liable for, and shall pay, such amount as though the original payment had not been made.<B> </B></P>
