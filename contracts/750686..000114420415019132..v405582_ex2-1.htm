"), by and among Camden National Corporation, a Maine corporation (" _Buyer_
"), ATLANTIC ACQUISITIONS, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company of which
Buyer is the sole member (" _Merger LLC_ "), and SBM Financial, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company and the
managing member of Merger LLC have determined that it is in the best interests
of their respective corporations and shareholders or sole member to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the strategic business
combination provided for herein;

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer and Merger LLC to enter
into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of the
Company (the " _Voting Agreement Stockholders_ ") has entered into a Voting
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Buyer (each a "
_Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Stockholder
has agreed, among other things, to vote such Voting Agreement Stockholder's
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company
Common Stock_ ") in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Merger LLC, and the Company intend to effect a merger (the "
_Merger_ ") of Merger LLC with and into the Company in accordance with this

Maryland Limited Liability Company Act, as amended (the " _MLLCA_ "), which
Merger will be followed immediately by a merger of the Company with and into
Buyer (the " _Upstream Merger_ "), with the Buyer to be the surviving entity
in the Upstream Merger. It is intended that the Merger be mutually
interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Upstream Merger and that
the Upstream Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by this
Agreement, be effected immediately following the Effective Time (as defined
below) without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of
the parties hereto;

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties intend the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered
together as a single integrated transaction, to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

Agreement, in accordance with the MGCL and MLLCA, and in reliance upon the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, at the Effective
Time, Merger LLC shall merge with and into the Company, the separate

practicable after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall have
been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to the

form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, Merger LLC and the Company, in

of the State of Maine (Buyer, as the surviving corporation in the Upstream
Merger, being sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

  



  

1.5 _Closing_. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be consummated at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") that will take place by

Goodwin Procter LLP, Exchange Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on a date
to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than five Business
Days (as defined in Section 9.3) after all of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Article VII (other than conditions to be satisfied at the
Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, such day being
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Surviving Corporation_. The directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Interim Surviving Corporation,
each of whom shall serve in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws of the
Interim Surviving Corporation. The directors of Buyer immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of
whom shall serve in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that effective immediately after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall expand the size of its Board of Directors,
and shall cause Buyer Bank to expand the size of its Board of Directors, by

exercise of the fiduciary duties of Buyer's and Buyer Bank's Board of
Directors, each of Buyer and Buyer Bank shall cause its Corporate Governance
and Risk Committee to nominate, and shall cause its Board to recommend for

Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code.

  



  

ARTICLE II - MERGER CONSIDERATION; 
 ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  



  

2.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Buyer, the Company and Merger LLC or
any stockholder of the Company:

  



    

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Buyer ("
_Buyer Common Stock_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and
shall be unchanged by the Merger.

  



  

(b) Each share of Buyer Company Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time
without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

  



  

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock and Company RSU (as defined
in Section 2.8(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Buyer Company Stock) shall become and be converted
into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the right to receive at the election of the holder thereof as
provided in Section 2.4 either (1) $206.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Cash Consideration_ "), or (2) 5.421 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of
Buyer Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). The Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the
" _Merger Consideration_."

  



  

2.2 _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of
Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.1(c), shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") previously
evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive,
for each such share of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.3. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common
Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of
the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under
this Article II. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock, other
than transfers of Company Common Stock that have occurred prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

2.3 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates
or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in
the Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional
share of Buyer Common Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the average of the daily closing prices during the
regular session of Buyer Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("
_NASDAQ_ ") (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_  or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source) for the ten consecutive trading days
ending on the fifth Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date,
rounded to the nearest whole cent.

2.4 _Election Procedures_.

  



  

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to a bank or trust company designated by Buyer and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")) in such form as the
Company and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ "), shall be
mailed no less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or
such other date as the Company and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing
Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock and Company RSU (as
defined in Section 2.8(b)) as of five Business Days prior to the Mailing
Date. Each Election Form shall permit the holder of record of Company Common
Stock (or in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through
proper instructions and documentation) to (i) elect to receive the Cash
Consideration for all or a portion of such holder's shares (a " _Cash
Election_ "), (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all or a
portion of such holder's shares (a " _Stock Election_ "), or (iii) make no
election with respect to the receipt of the Cash Consideration or the Stock
Consideration (a " _Non-Election_ "); provided, however,
that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
but subject to Section 2.5, eighty percent (80%) of the shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Stock Conversion Number_ "), shall be converted into the Stock
Consideration and the remaining shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Consideration Number_ ").
A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on behalf of other
Persons (as defined in Section 9.3) in any way will be entitled to submit an
Election Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with
respect to each Person for which it so acts. Shares of Company Common Stock
as to which a Cash Election has been made are referred to herein as " _Cash
Election Shares_." Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Stock
Election has been made are referred to herein as " _Stock Election Shares_."
Shares of Company Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as
to which an Election Form is not properly completed and returned in a timely
fashion) are referred to herein as " _Non-Election Shares_." The aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election has been made is referred to herein as the " _Stock Election
Number_."

  



  

(b) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
received by the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
25th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as mutually
agreed upon by the parties (which date shall be publicly announced by Buyer
as soon as practicable prior to such date)) (the " _Election Deadline_
"), accompanied by the Certificates as to which such Election Form is being
made or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set
forth in the Election Form, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States (provided, however, that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery; failure to
deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such guarantee of delivery
within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any
otherwise properly made election, unless otherwise determined by Buyer, in
its sole discretion). If a holder of Company Common Stock either (i) does not
submit a properly completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes
the holder's Election Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later
submitting a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline),
the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be designated
Non-Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

(c) The allocation among the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration will be made as set forth in this Section 2.4(c) (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.4(a),
whether fractions of Cash Election Shares, Stock Election Shares or Non-
Election Shares, as applicable, shall be rounded up or down).

  



  

(i) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion
Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and, subject to
Section 2.3 hereof, each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to
receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election
Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of
which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such
holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration;

  



  

(ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion
Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then
all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and the Cash Election Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:

  



  

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of
Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 2.3
hereof, each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such
holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-
Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of
Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Non-
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration; or

  



  

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration, and, subject to Section 2.3 hereof, each
holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the
Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the
denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

  



  

2.5 _Adjustments to Preserve Tax Treatment_. If either the tax
opinion referred to in Section 7.2(b) or the tax opinion referred to in
Section 7.3(b) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined, in each case, by
the counsel charged with giving such opinion) as a result of the Merger
potentially failing to satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirements under
applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under
Section 368(a) of the Code, then Buyer shall increase the Stock Conversion
Number to the minimum extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinions to
be rendered.

--- 

    



  

2.6 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) On or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II (" _New
Certificates_ ") and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered,
to the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article II (including the
estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock) (such cash and New Certificates, being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and
provided that the Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the
Exchange Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to
perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates with an Election Form, a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to
Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 of this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a New Certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
(if any) to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have
become entitled pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a check representing that
amount of cash (if any) to which such former holder of Company Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and/or (iii) a
check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Buyer Common Stock which such former holder has the right
to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 and
any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in Section 2.6(c).
No interest shall be paid or accrued on (x) any cash constituting Merger
Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) or (y) any
such unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.

  



  

(c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date on or
after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.6. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.6, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

(d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver cash and/or a New Certificate or New
Certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder of
Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.6,
or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in
an amount as may be required in each case by Buyer. If any New Certificates
evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting
such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time (as well
as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with Section 2.6(b) shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If
outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not
surrendered, or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which
such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items
shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable
law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock
transfer books of the Company to establish the identity of those
Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock
represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

  



  

(f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable
law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

2.7 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Buyer or the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or
provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock or Company
Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective
Time, the Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Consideration shall be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the
Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common
Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party
transaction or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director stock grants or similar
equity awards.

  



  

2.8 _Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") whether granted under the
Company's Equity Incentive Plan, (the " _Company Equity Plan_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Buyer and shall become
fully vested in accordance with their terms and converted into a stock option
(an " _Assumed Option_ ") to acquire shares of Buyer Common Stock in
accordance with this Section 2.8(a). Each such Assumed Option as so assumed
and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (but, taking into account any changes or adjustments
thereto, including any necessary changes or adjustments to any performance
vesting provisions, provided for in the Company Equity Plan, in any award
agreement or in such Company Stock Option by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby). As of the Effective Time, each such Assumed
Option as so assumed and converted shall be for that number of whole shares
of Buyer Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
share of Buyer Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio. At all
times after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall reserve for issuance such
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as necessary to permit the exercise of
the Assumed Options in a manner consistent with terms and conditions as
applied to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Options
shall be covered by an effective registration statement on Form S-8, and the
Buyer shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 covering such shares as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five
business days thereafter.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, all outstanding restricted stock units
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company RSUs_ ") under
any Company Equity Plan that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition
applicable to each Company RSU deemed satisfied) and shall be converted to the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.

--- 

    



  

(c) Not later than the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
the holders of Company Stock Options any required notices setting forth such
holders' rights pursuant to the relevant Company Equity Plan and award
documents and stating that such Company Stock Options, have been assumed by
Buyer and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject
to the adjustments required by this Section 2.8 after giving effect to the
Merger and the terms of the relevant Company Equity Plan).

  



  

(d) The Company and the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Company Board_ ") (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Company Equity Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
necessary or appropriate actions in order to effect the foregoing provisions
of this Section 2.8.

  



  

2.9 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Buyer may at any
time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated
by this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be
desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company
Common Stock as merger consideration as currently contemplated in this
Agreement, (ii) reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger, (iii) adversely affect the federal income tax
treatment of holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger, or
(iv) require submission to or approval of the Company's or Buyer's
stockholders after the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been
approved by the Company's stockholders. In the event that Buyer elects to make
such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect
the change.

3.13 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. For purposes of this Section 3.13, any
reference to the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to include a
reference to the Company's predecessors or the predecessors of its
Subsidiaries, respectively, and any reference to the Company shall be deemed
to include its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors of its Subsidiaries,
except where explicitly inconsistent with the language of this Section 3.13.

  



  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax
Returns that it was required to file under applicable laws and
regulations, other than Tax Returns that are not yet due or for which a
request for extension was filed consistent with requirements of
applicable law or regulation. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete
in all material respects and have been prepared in substantial compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations. Taxes due and owing by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
paid other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet
of the Company and which the Company is contesting in good faith. The Company
is not the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently has any
open tax years. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes
not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) The Company has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party.

  



  

(c) No foreign, federal, state, or local tax audits or
administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are being conducted or to the
Company's Knowledge are pending with respect to the Company. Other than with
respect to audits that have already been completed and resolved, the Company
has not received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority
(including jurisdictions where the Company has not filed Tax Returns) any (i)
notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for
information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by
any taxing authority against the Company.

  



  

(d) The Company has made available to Buyer true and complete copies
of the United States federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns
filed with respect to the Company for taxable periods ended on or after
December 31, 2010. The Company has delivered to Buyer correct and complete
copies of all examination reports, letter rulings, technical advice memoranda,
and similar documents, and statements of deficiencies assessed against or
agreed to by the Company filed for the years ended on or after December
31, 2010. The Company has timely and properly taken such actions in response
to and, in compliance with notices, the Company has received from the IRS in
respect of information reporting and backup and nonresident withholding as are
required by law.

  



  

(e) The Company has not waived any statute of limitations in respect
of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment
or deficiency.

(f) The Company has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during
the applicable period specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). The Company
has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein
that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax
within the meaning of Code Sections 6662 or 6662A and has not participated in
a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Section 1.6011-4(b) of the
Treasury Regulations. The Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement. The Company (i) has not been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was the Company), and (ii) has no liability
for the Taxes of any individual, bank, corporation, partnership, association,
joint stock company, business trust, limited liability company, or
unincorporated organization (other than the Company) under Reg.
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  



  

(g) The unpaid Taxes of the Company (i) did not, as of December 31,
2014, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct and
different from any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Company
Financial Statements (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not
exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since
December 31, 2014, the Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes
arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP,
outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and
practice.

  



  

(h) The Company will not be required to include any item of income
in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code
Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii)
intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Code Section 1502 (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law); (iv) installment sale
or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; (v)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date; (vi) election with
respect to the discharge of indebtedness under Section 108(i) of the Code; or
(vii) any similar election, action, or agreement that would have the effect of
deferring any liability for Taxes of the Company from any period ending on or
before the Closing Date to any period ending after the Closing Date.

  



  

(i) The Company has not distributed stock of another Person or had
its stock distributed by another Person in a transaction that was
purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or
Section 361 of the Code.

  



  

(j) As of the date hereof, the Company is aware of no reason why the
Merger will fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Code.

3.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of every Employee Program (as defined below)
that is maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) or
with respect to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any
liability (the " _Company Employee Programs_ ").

  



  

(b) True, complete and correct copies of the following documents,
with respect to each Company Employee Program, where applicable, have
previously been made available to Buyer: (i) all documents embodying or
governing such Company Employee Program and any funding medium for the
Company Employee Program; (ii) the most recent IRS determination or opinion
letter; (iii) the two most recently filed IRS Forms 5500; (iv) the most
recent actuarial valuation report; (v) the most recent summary plan
description (or other descriptions provided to employees) and all
modifications thereto; and (vi) all non-routine correspondence to and from any
state or federal agency.

  



  

(c) Each Company Employee Program that is intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code is so qualified and has received a
favorable determination or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such
qualification, or may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with
respect to a prototype plan adopted in accordance with the requirements for
such reliance, or has time remaining for application to the IRS for a
determination of the qualified status of such Company Employee Program for any
period for which such Company Employee Program would not otherwise be covered
by an IRS determination and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event or
omission has occurred that would cause any Company Employee Program to lose
such qualification.

  



  

(d) Each Company Employee Program is, and has been operated, in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is and has been
administered in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with its
terms, in each case, in all material respects. No litigation or governmental
administrative proceeding, audit or other proceeding (other than those
relating to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Employee Program or any
fiduciary or service provider thereof. All payments and/or contributions
required to have been made with respect to all Company Employee Programs
either have been made or have been accrued in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Employee Program and applicable law and with respect
to any such contributions, premiums, or other payments required to be made
under or with respect to any Company Employee Program that are not yet due or
payable, to the extent required by GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected on
the Company Balance Sheet.

  



  

(e) No Company Employee Program is a single employer pension plan
(within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA (as defined below)) for
which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section
4063 or 4064 of ERISA or a plan maintained by more than one employer as
described in Section 413(c) of the Code.

  



  

(f) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or
contributes to, or within the past six years has maintained or contributed
to, any Employee Program that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section
412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan (as defined
below) and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been paid in full.

  



    

19 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company Employee Programs provides health care or any
other non-pension welfare benefits to any employees after their employment is
terminated (other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA or similar state law) and the Company has never promised to provide such
post-termination benefits.

  



  

(h) Each Company Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or
otherwise modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by
applicable law, including the elimination of any and all future benefit
accruals thereunder and no employee communications or provision of any
Company Employee Program has failed to effectively reserve the right of the
Company or the ERISA Affiliate to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify
such Company Employee Program. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has announced its intention to modify or terminate any Company
Employee Program or adopt any arrangement or program which, once established,
would come within the definition of a Company Employee Program. Each asset
held under each Company Employee Program may be liquidated or
terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee, surrender charge or
comparable liability.

  



  

(i) The per share exercise price of each Option is no less than the
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant of
such Option (and as of each later modification thereof within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A
of the Code. Since December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2008, each
Company Employee Program that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been
operated and maintained in operational and documentary compliance with Section
409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be made
under any Company Employee Program is, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

  



  

(j) No Company Employee Program is subject to the laws of any
jurisdiction outside the United States.

  



  

(k) Except as set forth and quantified in reasonable detail on
_Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the stockholder approval of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the
accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount
or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or
other service provider of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates; (ii)
limit the right of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company
Employee Program or related trust; (iii) result in any "parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (whether or not such payment is
considered to be reasonable compensation for services rendered); or (iv)
result in a requirement to pay any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-
whole" payments to any employee, director or consultant of the Company or an
ERISA Affiliate. _Schedule 3.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the
Company's "disqualified individuals" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.

vehicle, each reference to such Employee Program shall include a reference to
such trust, organization or other vehicle.

  



  

(ii) " _ERISA_ " means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended.

Program, or has any obligation to contribute to or provide benefits under or
through such Employee Program, or if such Employee Program provides benefits
to or otherwise covers any current or former employee, officer or director of
such entity (or their spouses, dependents, or beneficiaries).

  



  

(iv) An entity is an " _ERISA Affiliate_ " of the Company (or other
entity if the context of this Agreement requires) if it would have ever been
considered a single employer with the Company (or other entity if the context
of this Agreement requires) under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or part of the
same "controlled group" as the Company for purposes of Section 302(d)(3) of
ERISA.

3.15 _Labor Matters_. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all federal, state and local laws respecting employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, and wages and
hours, and other than normal accruals of wages during regular payroll cycles,
there are no arrearages in the payment of wages. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by any collective bargaining
agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or
labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject
of a proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions of employment.
No work stoppage involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending,
or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is involved in, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened with or affected by, any dispute, arbitration, lawsuit or
administrative proceeding relating to labor or employment matters that would
reasonably be expected to interfere in any respect with the respective
business activities represented by any labor union, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, no labor union is attempting to organize employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

3.16 _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
insured, and during each of the past three calendar years has been insured,
for reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies against such risks as companies engaged in a similar
business would, in accordance with good business practice customarily be
insured, and has maintained all insurance required by applicable laws and
regulations. _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
insurance policies maintained by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof, including, without limitation, any bank-owned life
insurance policies (" _BOLI_ "). Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the policies and bonds maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and all
claims thereunder have been filed in a due and timely manner and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been denied. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under any insurance
policy, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or
the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a breach or default. The
value of the BOLI set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is fairly and accurately reflected on the Company Balance
Sheet. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the BOLI, and any other life insurance policies on the lives of any
current and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are maintained by the Company or any such Subsidiary or otherwise
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet are, and will at the Effective Time
be, owned by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, free and
clear of any claims thereon by the officers, directors or members of their
families.

contract, or otherwise.

  



  

(g) The unpaid Taxes of Buyer (i) did not, as of the end of the most
recent period covered by the Buyer SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date

or the conditions to each party's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.5 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates and other
agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making
of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or
otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Buyer) any information or
data with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive any
provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which the Company is a party; or (iv) enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the Company Representatives, whether or not such
Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Company
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. The Company
and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with
respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any
transaction pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would
acquire (whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or
indirectly, any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing,
in the aggregate, 25% or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other
disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase or securities convertible into, such securities) representing 25% or
more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning 25%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form, substance or
purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the
foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company may take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of
Section 6.5(a) if, but only if, (i) the Company has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.5; (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, (A) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that it is required to take such actions to comply with the standard
of conduct required of a board of directors under the MGCL or other fiduciary
duties owed to the Company's shareholders under applicable law; (iii) the
Company has provided Buyer with at least two Business Days' prior notice of
such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
shall promptly provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not
previously provided to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no
later than the date of provision of such information to such other party.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent
financial advisor (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of
all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction
that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the
consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the
consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other
risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in
addition to those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms
of such proposal, more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably
likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal.

  



  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by,
any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or the Company
Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and
such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions
or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers. The Company agrees
that it shall keep Buyer informed, on a reasonably current basis (and in any
event within 24 hours), of the status and terms of any material developments
with respect to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer
or request).

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the Company
Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within three
Business Days following a request by Buyer, or make any statement, filing or
release, in connection with the Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent
with the Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral
position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
considered an adverse modification of the Company Recommendation); (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5(b)) or (B) requiring the Company
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(d), prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the
Company Recommendation (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_ ") after the
third Business Day following Buyer's receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Buyer that the Company Board
has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.5) constitutes
a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the Company Board has reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
it is required to take such actions to comply with the standard of conduct
required of a board of directors under the MGCL or other fiduciary duties
owed to the Company's shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the
three Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by
Buyer (the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company and the Company Board shall have
cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a
Company Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that Buyer shall not have
any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended
terms as may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice
of Superior Proposal, the Company Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.5(e) and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Buyer and again comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.5(e), except that the Notice Period shall be
reduced to two Business Days.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from complying with the Company's obligations required
under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure.

6.6 _Takeover Laws_. No party shall take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, as applicable, and each party
shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from,
or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable
Takeover Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, that purports to apply to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.7 _Shares Listed_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
required by NASDAQ, Buyer shall file a notice of additional listing of
shares with NASDAQ with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be
issued to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger.

  



  

6.8 _Regulatory Applications; Filings; Consents_. Buyer and the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts (a) to promptly prepare all documentation,
effect all filings and obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the Regulatory Approvals, and (b) to comply with the terms
and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Buyer be required to agree to
any prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement which would (A)
prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, of all or any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) compel Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion
of the business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) compel Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
request, if the prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement
described in clauses (A)-(C) of this sentence would have a material adverse
effect on the future operation by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of their
business, taken as a whole (the " _Burdensome Conditions_ "). Provided that
the Company has cooperated as required above, Buyer agrees to file the
requisite applications or notices to be filed by it with the FRB and the OCC.
Each of Buyer and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto
agrees that it will consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the
obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party
will keep the other parties reasonably apprised of the status of material
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and all
limitations of liability existing in favor of any director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in the Company's Charter or Bylaws or in the similar governing documents of
the Company's Subsidiaries or as provided in applicable law as in effect as of
the date hereof with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation the right to advancement of
expenses, shall survive the Merger.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the Company's
directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall
provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other
terms at least as favorable to, the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company,
so long as the aggregate cost is not more than 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Limit_ "). In
the event that the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, the
Company may enter into an agreement to spend up to that amount to purchase
such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount.

  



  

(c) In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

  



  

6.10 _Employees and Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) After the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to provide the employees
of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") with at least the
types and levels of employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to those
then maintained by Buyer for similarly-situated employees of Buyer (but
excluding any retiree health or life insurance benefit, in each case only to
the extent that other newly hired employees of Buyer are not eligible
for such benefits). Buyer will treat, and cause its applicable Buyer Employee
Programs to treat, the service of the Company Employees with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as service rendered to Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for
level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan
for purposes of severance benefits, for any purposes under any post-
termination/retiree welfare benefit plan or for purposes of any equity based
compensation or benefits or profit-sharing contribution) attributable to any
period before the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject
to the terms and conditions of Buyer's applicable Buyer Employee Programs,
Buyer shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company's
employees to receive credit for their prior service for eligibility and
vesting purposes in Buyer's 401(k) plan and for purposes of determining the
length of vacation, sick time, paid time off and severance under the Buyer's
applicable plan to policy. Buyer shall also provide that the Company's
employees shall not be treated as "new" employees for purposes of any
exclusions under any health or similar plan of Buyer for a pre-existing
medical condition to the extent that any such exclusion did not apply under a
health or similar plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and to provide that any deductibles, co-payments or
out-of-pocket expenses paid under any of the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' health plans shall be credited towards deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket expenses under Buyer's health plans upon delivery to Buyer
of appropriate documentation, subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Buyer Employee Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.10, service and other amounts shall not be credited to Company
Employees (or their eligible dependents) to the extent the crediting of
such service or other amounts would result in the duplication of benefits.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, none of the provisions
contained herein shall operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any
Company Employee or the funding of any such benefit.

  



    

57 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to whether
or when to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and
programs of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless a Company
Employee affirmatively terminates coverage (or causes coverage to terminate)
under a Company or Company Subsidiary health plan prior to the time such
Company Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Buyer or Buyer
Subsidiary health plan, no coverage of any of the Company Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the Company or Company Subsidiary
health plans prior to the time such Company Employees and their dependents
become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits
common to all employees of the Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary and their dependents.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to honor and continue to be obligated to
perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current
and former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing as of
the date hereof, including, without limitation, all employment, severance,
deferred compensation and change in control agreements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries listed in _Schedule 6.10(c)_.

  



  

(d) If requested by Buyer, the Company shall terminate its 401(k)
plan effective as of the day prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon
the occurrence thereof) and adopt all required compliance amendments pursuant
to written resolutions, the form and substance of which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer. If the Company 401(k) plan is terminated, Buyer agrees
to permit participants in the Company 401(k) plan who are continuing
employees of the Buyer to roll over their account balances and outstanding
loan balances from such plan to the Buyer's 401(k) plan, and such continuing
employees who satisfy the eligibility requirements of Buyer's 401(k) plan
(taking into account credit for prior years of service with the Company
pursuant to Section 6.10(a), other than for purposes of profit-sharing
contribution) shall be eligible to immediately participate in the Buyer's
401(k) plan.

  



  

(e) Buyer agrees to honor the severance guidelines attached as
_Schedule 6.10(e)_ in connection with the termination of employment of any
Company Employee, other than an employee who is a party to an employment
agreement, change in control agreement or other separation agreement that
provides a benefit on a termination of employment, whose employment is
terminated involuntarily (other than for Cause, as defined in _Schedule
6.10(e)_ ) within one year following the Effective Time, shall receive a lump
sum severance payment from Buyer in such amounts, at such times and upon such
conditions as set forth on said Schedule.

(f) Within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
designate, in consultation with the Company, certain employees of the
Company who will be entitled to receive a retention bonus from Buyer in the
event such employee remains an employee of Buyer as of the Closing Date
and/or through a post-Closing transition period to be determined by Buyer,
including systems conversion, if applicable. The aggregate amount of such
retention bonuses for all designated employees shall be $200,000 and the
allocation and timing of payment of each such bonus will be determined by
Buyer, in consultation with the Company, within 45 days after the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

(g) From the date hereof through the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide Buyer with
reasonable access (at reasonable times, upon reasonable notice and in a manner
that will not materially interfere with the normal operations of the Company)
to the (i) employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the
Company's human resources personnel and personnel records (to the extent not
prohibited by Applicable Law) for purposes of (A) facilitating an orderly
transition of such employees from and after the Closing, (B) making
announcements concerning, and preparing for the consummation of, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (C) engaging, communicating
or meeting with and/or presenting to such employees on either an individual
or group basis with respect to matters related to their prospective continued
employment with Buyer on and after the Closing. The Company and Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to consult with each other, and will consider in
good faith each other's advice, prior to sending any notices or other
communication materials to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the effects thereof on the employment,
compensation or benefits of such employees and, in any case, any such notice
or communication materials shall comply with applicable law.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section
6.10 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Program
or any other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement
or (ii) give any third party, including any Company Employee, any former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary
representative thereof, any right to enforce the provisions of this Section
6.10. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (x) confer upon any
Company Employee or any other Person any right to continued employment after
the Effective Time or (y) prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates
from amending, modifying or terminating any Employee Program or any other
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement.

  



  

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Buyer and the
Company shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to
result in any condition set forth in Article VII not being satisfied, or (b)
notwithstanding the standards set forth in Section 9.1, would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein. No such notice by Buyer or the
Company shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to
Buyer's or the Company's obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.12 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon
as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event
more than 15 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Buyer (a) consolidated
financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
stockholders' equity) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of and
for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports
showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period and (c)
any reports provided to the board of directors of the Company or any

extent of Buyer's obligations under Section 6.4(b).

shall remain in full force and effect after the date hereof in accordance with
its respective terms.

  



  

6.14 _Certain Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to: (a) timely file (taking into account any extensions of

such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past
practice; (b) timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax
Returns that are so filed; (c) establish an accrual in its books and records
and financial statements in accordance with past practice for all Taxes
payable by it for which a Tax Return is due prior to the Effective Time; and
(d) promptly notify Buyer of any suit, claim, action, investigation,

its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter, including, without limitation,
Tax liabilities and refund claims.

  



  

6.15 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall provide Buyer the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Buyer's prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

6.16 _Section 16 Votes_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall approve in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule

6.18 _Leases_. Upon request of Buyer, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an estoppel from any third-party

ground lease, or in a form as prepared by Buyer.

represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersedes any and all
other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except for Section 6.9

Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer or Merger LLC without the written
consent of the Company and no such assignment shall release Buyer of its
obligations hereunder. After the Closing, Buyer's rights and obligations
hereunder shall be freely assignable. This Agreement may not be assigned by

be binding upon and enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
except as expressly set forth herein, is not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

9.9 _Headings; Interpretation_. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this
Agreement. The word "including" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation," unless the context
otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified. Words of number may be read

9.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without
regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. Each of the parties hereto
(a) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to and submit itself to
the personal jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the State
of Maine (" _Maine Courts_ ") in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined only in any such Maine Courts, and (c) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such Maine Courts. Each of the
parties hereto waives any defense or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought in any such Maine Courts and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
in any such Maine Courts with respect thereto. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.6. Nothing
in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF BUYER AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  



  

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained
in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek (i) a
decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction, without
the posting of any bond, restraining such breach or threatened breach.

and Schedules hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting
Agreements and any documents delivered by the parties in connection herewith
constitutes the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

9.14 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to substitute a valid, legal, and enforceable provision which,
insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this
Agreement.
