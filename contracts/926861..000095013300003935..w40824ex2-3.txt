Agreement"), pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Stockholder has agreed,
among other things, to vote certain of his shares of Company Common Stock in
favor of the approval of the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein; and

          WHEREAS, MergerCo, MergerLP, the Company, and FWOP desire to make

                                   ARTICLE 1

                                  THE MERGERS


          1.1 The Company Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and MergerCo shall consummate the
Company Merger pursuant to which (a) the Company shall be merged with and into

Company Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Company")
and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,

          1.3 Closing. The closing of the Mergers (the "Closing") shall occur as
promptly as practicable (but in no event earlier than January 12, 2001) after
all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have been satisfied or, if
permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, and,
subject to the foregoing, shall take place at such time and on a date to be
specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Goodwin, Procter & Hoar LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New
York 10022, unless another place is agreed to by the parties hereto.

          1.4 Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after all of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have been satisfied or, if
permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, (i)
MergerCo and the Company shall duly execute and file (x) articles of merger (the
"Articles of Company Merger") with the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "SDAT") in accordance with Section 3-109

the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 17-211(c) of the DRULPA. The
Mergers shall become effective (the "Effective Time") at such time as (x) the
Articles of Company Merger and the Articles of Partnership Merger are accepted
for record by SDAT and (y) the Certificate of Company Merger and the Certificate
of Partnership Merger are accepted for record by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or such later time as MergerCo and the Company shall specify
therein.

          1.5 Effect of the Company Merger on the Organizational Documents of

shall not govern the business or affairs of the Surviving Company.


                                       4
<PAGE>   11


          1.6  Effect of the Partnership Merger on Agreement of Limited
Partnership. In connection with the Closing, the Agreement of Limited
Partnership of MergerLP as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "MergerLP Partnership Agreement") will be amended to make certain changes
in order to reflect the Partnership Merger and the other Transactions. The
MergerLP Partnership Agreement shall be amended and restated to contain
substantially the terms set forth in Exhibit 1.6 hereto and shall govern the
business and affairs of MergerLP following the Partnership Merger.

          1.7  Effect of Mergers on Management. The manager of MergerCo
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial manager of the
Surviving Company and the officers of MergerCo immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company, each to
hold office in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement of the
Surviving Company in effect at the Effective Time.

          1.8  Liquidating Distribution. The Company hereby confirms that the
Transactions shall constitute its plan of liquidation within the meaning of
Section 562(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

          1.9  Alternative Structures. Prior to the consummation of the Mergers,
MergerLP shall have the right, at its election, to restructure the Partnership
Merger so that, rather than merging directly into MergerLP, FWOP would merge
into a limited liability company that is wholly owned by MergerLP; provided that
any such restructuring would not have an adverse financial effect on the
stockholders of the Company or the limited partners of FWOP. In the event Merger
LP makes such an election, the parties agree to make appropriate conforming
amendments to the Transaction Documents and any related agreements.

                                   ARTICLE II

          2.1  Effect on Equity Interests. As of the Effective Time,

of any stockholder of the Company or any party hereto:

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time.

               (b)  Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock that is owned by the Company, or by any wholly owned Company Subsidiary of
the Company shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

               (c)  Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by the Company
or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries) shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive an amount obtained by dividing (i) the sum of (A)
$83,166,740 and (B) the difference (it being understood that if the amount
described in the following clause (1) is less than the amount described in the
following clause (2), then such difference shall be subtracted from, rather than
added to, the amount set forth in the preceding clause (A)), if any, between (1)
the aggregate amount of the outstanding balance (including principal and any
accrued and unpaid interest) of the Assumed Loans for the Merger Agreement
Properties (as such terms are defined in the Real Estate Purchase Agreement) set
forth on Exhibit 2.1(c), and (2) the aggregate amount of the outstanding balance
(including principal and any accrued and unpaid interest) of the Assumed Loans
for the Merger Agreement Properties on the Closing Date, excluding for this
purpose the $3,000,000 loan on the Woodmoor property referred to in Section
8.2(n), by (ii) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
number of additional shares of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time if all holders (other than the Company)
of Company Preferred Stock, Common Units or Preferred Units had converted their
Company Preferred Stock (including any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon),
Common Units or Preferred Units (including any accrued but unpaid distributions
thereon), as the case may be, into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one hundredth cent (the "Common Stock
Consideration"), which Common Stock Consideration shall be payable to the holder
thereof in cash, without any interest thereon.

               (d)  All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted as
provided in Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each Certificate (as hereinafter defined)
previously representing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Common Stock Consideration. The holders of Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company Common
Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by law.

               (e)  Each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than those shares referred to in
Section 2.1(b), shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount equal to the sum of (A) the product of 1.282051282051 and the Common
Stock Consideration and (B) any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of
Company Preferred Stock and rounded to the nearest one hundredth cent (the
"Preferred Stock Consideration" and together with the Common Stock
Consideration, the "Company Merger Consideration"), which Preferred Stock
Consideration shall be payable to the holder thereof in cash, without any
interest thereon.

               (f)  All shares of Company Preferred Stock, when converted as
provided in Section 2.1(e), shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each


                                       6

Certificate (as hereinafter defined) previously representing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.1(e). The holders of Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company
Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by law.

          2.2  Payment for Shares.

               (a)  From and after the Effective Time, the Company's transfer
agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, shall act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, MergerCo shall deposit, or take
all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the
aggregate Company Merger Consideration (such aggregate Company Merger
Consideration being hereinafter referred to as the "Stock Exchange Fund") that
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and shares of Company Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1.

               (b)  Promptly, and in any event within three business days after
the Effective Time, MergerCo shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate(s) that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
("Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (the "Company Letter of
Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates duly endorsed to the Exchange Agent and in such form and with such
other provisions as MergerCo may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and receiving the aggregate
Common Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in
respect thereof. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such Company Letter of Transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the amount of the aggregate Common Stock Consideration or Preferred
Stock Consideration, as applicable, to which such holder shall be entitled,
after giving effect to any required withholding tax, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled forthwith. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, checks for the aggregate Common Stock
Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, to which such
holder shall be entitled may be issued and paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate representing shares of such Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Exchange Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
make appropriate arrangements for the immediate payment of the applicable Common
Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration to the beneficial owners of
any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that are held in
book-entry or other


                                       7
<PAGE>   14


electronic form and for which at the Effective Time there is no Certificate
representing the ownership thereof.

               (c)  At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Company, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the aggregate Common
Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in respect
thereof in accordance with this Section 2.2.

               (d)  Any portion of the Stock Exchange Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for 180 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company. Any former
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Company for payment of any Common Stock Consideration, or Preferred
Stock Consideration, as applicable, as determined pursuant to this Agreement to
be owing to such Exiting Partner, without any interest thereon. None of
MergerCo, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company will issue and pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Common Stock Consideration or
Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable.

          2.3  Company Preferred Stock. In accordance with the terms of the
Company Charter, each holder of Company Preferred Stock shall receive in
connection with the Company Liquidating Distribution an amount per share of
Company Preferred Stock, in the aggregate, equal to what such holder would have
received had such holder converted all of its shares of Company Preferred Stock
into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation of the
Transactions. In furtherance thereof, each holder of Company Preferred Stock
shall receive from the Company (in addition to the Preferred Stock Consideration
payable to such holder by MergerCo pursuant to Section 2.1(e)), in connection
with the Company Liquidating Distribution, an amount per share of Company
Preferred Stock equal to what each holder would have received had such holder
converted its shares of Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Company Liquidating Distribution.

          2.4  No Dissenters' Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall
be available to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
with respect to the Transactions.


                                  ARTICLE III

          EFFECT OF THE PARTNERSHIP MERGER ON THE PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
             OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTNERSHIPS; PAYMENT FOR INTERESTS

          3.1  Effect on Partnership Interests. As of the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of Units in FWOP or any party hereto:

               (a)  The general partnership interest in FWOP shall be converted
into the general partnership interest in MergerLP, entitling the holder thereof
to the same economic interest in MergerLP as it held in FWOP prior to the
Effective Time.

               (b)  The limited partnership interests in FWOP held by Exiting
Partners (as defined herein) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive: (i) for each common unit of limited
partnership interest in FWOP (each, a "Common Unit"), an amount equal to the
Common Stock Consideration payable to the holder thereof in cash, without any
interest thereon (the "Common Unit Cash Consideration") and (ii) for each Series
B Preferred Unit in FWOP (each, a "Series B Preferred Unit", and together with
the Common Units, the "Units"), an amount equal to the Preferred Stock
Consideration (the "Series B Preferred Unit Cash Consideration", and together
with the Common Unit Cash Consideration and the Series A Preferred Unit Cash
Consideration, the "Exiting Partner Cash Consideration"), which Exiting Partner
Cash Consideration shall be payable to the holder thereof in cash, without any
interest thereon. All Units so converted shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist, and each Unit shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the applicable amount of cash specified above.

               (c)  The limited partnership interests in FWOP held by Continuing
Partners (as defined herein) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into: (i) for each Common Unit, one MergerLP Preferred
Unit with an initial capital account in MergerLP equal to the Common Unit Cash
Consideration, and (ii) for each Series B Preferred Unit, 1.282051282051
MergerLP Preferred Units with an initial capital account in MergerLP equal to
the Series B Preferred Unit Cash Consideration. All Units so converted shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each Unit
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive that number of MergerLP
Preferred Units specified above (the MergerLP Preferred Units issuable in
respect of any given Unit pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) are referred to herein
as, the "Continuing Partner Consideration" and together with the Exiting Partner
Consideration, the "Partnership Merger Consideration").


                                       9
<PAGE>   16


               (d)  Each Unit, if any, reclassified after the date of this
Agreement as a "Series A Common Unit" in the Recapitalization shall be converted
automatically into one common unit of MergerLP (each, a "MergerLP Common Unit").

               (e)  As used in this Section 3.1, the term "Exiting Partner"
means any holder of Units that elects, or is deemed to have elected, to receive
cash in exchange for its Units, in connection with the Partnership Merger, by
delivering to FWOP written notice of such election no later than twenty (20)
Business Days from the date that the Consent Solicitation Materials (as defined
herein) are sent to such holder, and the term "Continuing Partner" means any
holder of Units that elects to receive MergerLP Preferred Units in exchange for
its Units, in connection with the Partnership Merger, by delivering to FWOP (y)
written notice of such election and (z) an investor questionnaire that confirms
certain matters with respect to such holder, including its status as an
"accredited investor" under Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") no later than twenty (20) Business Days
from the date that the Consent Solicitation Materials are sent to such holder.
Each holder that fails to deliver a timely election notice and/or an investor
questionnaire that confirms the matters set forth above within such twenty (20)
Business Day period shall be deemed to be an Exiting Partner.

          3.2  Payment of Exiting Partner Consideration.

               (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, MergerLP shall deposit, or take
all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the
aggregate Exiting Partner Consideration for all Units held by Exiting Partners
(such Exiting Partner Consideration being hereinafter referred to as, the "Unit
Exchange Fund") that Exiting Partners shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(b). FWOP shall deliver to the Exchange Agent a record of all Units
held by Exiting Partners, specifying the actual number of Common Units and
Series B Preferred Units held by each such holder and the address shown on
FWOP's books and records for each such holder.

               (b)  Promptly, and in any event within three business days after
the Effective Time, MergerLP shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
Exiting Partner a letter of transmittal (the "Partnership Letter of
Transmittal") with instructions for receiving the Common Unit Cash Consideration
or the Series B Preferred Unit Cash Consideration, as applicable, in respect of
each Unit held by such Exiting Partner. Upon returning a Partnership Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holder of such Units shall be entitled to receive a check
representing the amount of the Common Unit Cash Consideration and/or Series B
Preferred Unit Cash Consideration, as applicable, to which such holder shall be
entitled, after giving effect to any required withholding tax. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of a Unit which is not reflected in the record as
delivered by FWOP to the Exchange Agent, checks for the aggregate Common Unit
Cash Consideration or the Series B Preferred Unit Cash Consideration, as
applicable, to which such holder shall be entitled may be issued and paid to
such transferee if all documentation reasonably required by the Exchange


                                       10
<PAGE>   17

Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and payment of any applicable
transfer taxes has been delivered to the Exchange Agent.

               (c)  Any portion of the Unit Exchange Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Exiting
Partners for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to MergerLP.
Any Exiting Partner who has not theretofore complied with this Section 3.2 shall
thereafter look only to MergerLP for payment of any Common Unit Cash
Consideration or the Series B Preferred Unit Cash Consideration, as applicable,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement to be owing to such Exiting Partner,
without any interest thereon. None of MergerCo, MergerLP, FWOP, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Exiting Partner for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

          3.3  Appraisal Rights.

               (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any Units which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by the limited partners of FWOP who have filed with FWOP
no later than twenty (20) Business Days from the date that the Consent
Solicitation Materials (as defined herein) are sent to such holder, written
objections to the Plan of Liquidation, and who have not voted such Units in
favor of the Plan of Liquidation and the Transactions ("Dissenting Units"), will
not be converted at the Effective Time as described in Section 3.1 hereof, but,
will thereafter constitute only the right to receive payment of the fair value
of such Units in accordance with the applicable provisions of Maryland law (the
"Appraisal Rights Provisions"); provided, however, that all Units held by
limited partners who shall have failed to perfect (in accordance with Section
3-203 of the MGCL) or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such Units under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Common Unit Cash Consideration or the Series B Preferred Unit Cash
Consideration, as applicable, without interest thereon, in the manner provided
in Section 3.1. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Units as aforesaid will not receive the Common Unit Cash
Consideration or the Series B Preferred Unit Cash Consideration, as applicable,
as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided by
the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Units. FWOP
shall give MergerLP prompt notice of any demands received by FWOP for the
exercise of appraisal rights with respect to any Units and MergerCo shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. FWOP shall not, except with the prior written consent of MergerCo
or as required by law, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

               (b) Each dissenting limited partner who becomes entitled under
Maryland law to payment for Dissenting Units shall receive payment therefor
after the Effective Time from MergerLP in accordance with Maryland law, and such
Units shall be canceled.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          7.1  Stockholders Meeting.

               (a)  The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in
accordance with applicable law:

                    (i)  duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") as soon as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement solely for the purpose of considering
and taking action upon the Plan of Liquidation and the Transactions;

                    (ii) as promptly as practicable, prepare and, subject to the
approval of MergerCo (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Plan
of Liquidation and the Transactions;

                    (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain and
furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in a definitive proxy

promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy
statement and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly to its
stockholders, and (B) obtain the necessary approval of the Plan of Liquidation

               (b)  Each of the Company and FWOP, on the one hand, and MergerCo
and MergerLP, on the other hand, agree promptly to correct any information
provided by either of them for use in the Proxy Statement or the Consent
Solicitation Materials (as defined herein) if and to the extent that such

further agree to take all necessary steps to cause the Proxy Statement and the

misleading.

          7.2  Partner Approval. Promptly upon execution of this Agreement, but
after such materials have been reviewed and approved by MergerCo (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company shall distribute
customary consent solicitation materials (the "Consent Solicitation Materials")
to the partners of FWOP to seek the approval of a Majority-in-Interest of the
Limited Partners (as defined in the FWOP Partnership Agreement) (the "Partner
Approval") for the Partnership Merger, the Recapitalization and any other
matters reasonably requested by the parties hereto, in the manner required by
the FWOP Partnership Agreement.

          7.3  Officers' and Directors' Indemnification.


               (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding
or investigation in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof, or who becomes, prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that he or she
is or was a director or


                                       14
<PAGE>   21


officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or is or was serving
at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that
after the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by the Company's Charter (the
"Company Charter") and the Company Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws") in effect on
the date hereof, each Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time), (A) the Surviving Company shall promptly pay expenses
as incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law,
subject to the provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to
reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to such amounts, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one
counsel satisfactory to them (subject to the consent of the Surviving Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Surviving Company shall pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
within 30 days after statements therefor are received, and (C) the Surviving
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense
of any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Company shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and
provided, further that the Surviving Company shall have no obligation hereunder
to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
non-appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.3, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify the Surviving Company of such claim and the relevant facts and
circumstances with respect thereto; provided that the failure to so notify shall
not affect the obligations of the Surviving Company except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices the Surviving Company.

               (b) MergerCo agrees that all rights to indemnification existing
in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, the directors and
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provided for in the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a "Claim")
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Claim. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage ("D&O Insurance") for the Company's
directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide

benefits to participants or retirees and extinguish all contingent benefits
(including all outstanding Company Options (as defined herein) and all

receiving a retention bonus in exchange for such employee's continued service to
the Company from the date hereof until the Effective Time shall execute and
deliver a release, substantially on the terms of Exhibit 7.4(a), or FRW, Inc.
shall indemnify and hold MergerCo harmless from any and all claims that would
otherwise be released under Exhibit 7.4(a). The Company shall ensure that all
individuals whose qualifying event occurs on or prior to the Effective Time (and

               (b)  The Company agrees that it shall extinguish or otherwise

compensation and disability benefits) for those former employees of the Company

to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, those employees terminated
in connection with the Company's obligation under Section 7.4(a).

               (c)  The Company acknowledges and agrees that MergerCo has the
right to interview and discuss employment terms and issues with such employees
prior to and after the Effective Time. MergerCo specifically reserves the right,
on or after the Effective Time, to employ or reject any of the employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other applicants in its sole and
absolute discretion; provided that MergerCo shall provide to the Company a list
of employees to whom MergerCo intends to offer employment at the Effective Time.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a commitment or obligation of
MergerCo to accept for employment, or otherwise continue the employment of, any
of the Company's employees.

               (d)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
steps necessary to comply with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification
