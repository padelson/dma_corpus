WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, certain Affiliates of Parent have entered into a Support Agreement
with the Company (the "Support Agreement");

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

 

The Offer

 

 

1.1. The Offer.

 

 

(a) Commencement. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Article IX, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable (and,
in any event, by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on December 22, 2010)
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer
to purchase all outstanding Shares at the Offer Price. The obligations of
Parent to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject to only those conditions set forth in Exhibit A
(the "Tender Offer Conditions"). The Company agrees that no Shares held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Shares held on
behalf of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

 

(b) Waiver of Tender Offer Conditions. Parent expressly reserves the right
from time to time, in its sole discretion, to waive any Tender Offer
Condition; provided that without the prior written consent of the Company,
Parent shall not, (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend, modify or waive satisfaction of
the Minimum Condition or the Regulatory Condition (each, as defined in
Exhibit A), (iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend or modify
any of the Tender Offer Conditions in a manner adverse to holders of Shares
(for the avoidance of doubt, other than the Minimum Condition and the
Regulatory Condition, which shall not be amended, modified or waived without
the prior written consent of the Company), (v) accelerate the Expiration Date
to any date earlier than January 25, 2011, (vi) make any change in the Offer
that would require an extension or delay of the then-current Expiration Date
(other than an increase in the Offer Price), (vii) amend any other term of
the Offer in a manner adverse to holders of Shares or (viii) except as
provided in Section 1.1(d), extend the then-current Expiration Date of the
Offer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Securities Filings. On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer filed under cover of Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") and the related offer
to purchase, letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be
made (collectively, and including any supplements or amendments thereto, the
"Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the applicable
federal securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Laws"). The Company agrees to
furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company required by the
Securities Laws to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by
it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to
be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or
supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and
to the extent required by the Securities Laws. Parent will provide the
Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents, and any amendments thereto, before they are filed with the SEC or
disseminated to the holders of Shares. Parent shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
the Offer Documents and provide copies of such comments to the Company
promptly upon receipt and copies of proposed responses to the Company a
reasonable time prior to filing or dissemination to allow for meaningful
comment by the Company.

 

 

(d) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight (Eastern time) on the later of (x) the
20th business day following the commencement of the Offer and (y) January
25, 2011 (the initial expiration date, or such subsequent date to which
the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"), and Parent shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with the effective
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX or pursuant to
Section 1.1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, without receiving
the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Expiration Date for any period
required by the Securities Laws or the rules and regulations of the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") applicable to the Offer (it being agreed and
understood that if Parent increases the Offer Price, it shall be required to
extend the Expiration Date for the minimum period required under the
Securities Laws) or (ii) elect to provide a subsequent offering period for
the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act; provided
that, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, Parent shall
immediately accept for payment and promptly (and in any event within three
(3) business days) pay for all Shares tendered during any such subsequent
offering period. In addition, Parent shall, if requested by the Company,
make available a subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act; provided, that Parent shall not be
required to make available such subsequent offering period in the event that,
prior to the commencement of such subsequent offering period, Parent then
holds of record more than 90% of the outstanding Shares. So long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Article IX or the Offer has not
been terminated pursuant to Section 1.1(f) (and subject to each
party's rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article IX), if at any
scheduled Expiration Date, the Tender Offer Conditions shall not have been
satisfied or earlier waived, Parent shall extend the Offer and the Expiration
Date to a date that is not more than five (5) business days after such
previously scheduled Expiration Date; provided, however, that Parent shall
not be required to extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date later
than the Termination Date. Nothing contained herein shall limit or otherwise
affect the Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections
9.2 and 9.3 in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "business day" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Offer Closing. Subject solely to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent in
accordance with Section 1.1(b) hereof of the Tender Offer Conditions, Parent
shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of the Offer (and in any
event within three (3) business days), accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the time at
which immediately available funds are irrevocably deposited by Parent with
the depositary for payment for all Shares in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Offer Price for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (excluding Shares validly tendered pursuant
to a subsequent offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) being referred to as the "Offer Closing"). The date on which
the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Closing Date". Parent shall have on a timely basis the cash necessary
to purchase any Shares that Parent becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer in order to consummate the Offer Closing.

 

 

(f) Offer Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to a Tender
Termination or if this Agreement has been duly adopted by holders of Shares
constituting the Company Requisite Vote in accordance with applicable Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Parent
shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day of such
termination or adoption, as applicable), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to a
Tender Termination prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Parent shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Parent
to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof. A "Tender Termination" is a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a) in connection with a Subsequent
Transaction, Section 9.1, Section 9.3(b), Section 9.3(c)(i), Section 9.3(d),
Section 9.4(c) or Section 9.4(d). The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that if the Offer is terminated as a result of the adoption of this Agreement
by holders of Shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote, such
termination shall not give rise to a right of termination of this Agreement
except to the extent expressly provided for in Article IX and that, absent
such termination of this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties hereunder
other than those related to the Offer shall continue to remain in effect,
including those obligations with respect to the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(g) Withholding. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares
such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing authority by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of the Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

 

 

(h) Continuation of Offer. Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
a Tender Termination, in which event the Offer shall be terminated by Parent
in accordance with Section 1.1(f)), Parent shall not be required to terminate
the Offer in connection with a termination of this Agreement if and only if,
(1) the Offer has not been terminated prior to the date of termination of
this Agreement, (2) the Offer, including any extensions thereof, does not
have an expiration date later than September 15, 2011 (it being agreed and
understood that Parent may not amend, modify or waive any terms or conditions
of the Offer which would require Parent to extend the expiration date of the
Offer to any date later than the September 15, 2011 under the Securities Laws
or the rules and regulations of the NYSE), (3) the only conditions to the
obligations of Parent to accept for payment and to pay for Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be the conditions set
forth in Exhibit A-2 hereto (the "Continuing Conditions"), and Parent shall
not amend, modify or waive satisfaction of the Continuing Minimum Condition
(as defined in Exhibit A-2) or impose additional conditions to the Offer (it
being agreed and understood that Parent shall be permitted to amend the
Tender Offer Conditions in order to provide that the Continuing Offer shall
only be subject to Continuing Conditions), (4) Parent provides the Company
with an irrevocable commitment to comply with clauses (iv) and (v) of the

Parent has available to it cash, cash equivalents or readily marketable
securities available to it throughout the Offer in an amount sufficient to

the Company to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent.

1.2.   Company Action.

 

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall, after affording Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, file with the SEC, as
promptly as practicable after the filing by Parent of the Offer Documents
(and in any event within ten (10) business days following such filing),
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including
the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), which shall, subject to Section
7.2(e) and Section 1.1(h), include the Company Recommendation with respect to
the Offer and the Fairness Opinions, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9
to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. Subject to Section 7.2(e) and Section 1.1(h), the Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Recommendation. The Company agrees promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that it shall become false or misleading in any material
respect (and each of Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to written
information supplied by it specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall
promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of such information
and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such information)
and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include
any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company's stockholders as and
to the extent required by the Securities Laws. Parent and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
and any amendments thereto before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated
to the holders of Shares. The Company shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 and provide copies of such comments to Parent promptly
upon receipt and copies of proposed responses to Parent a reasonable time
prior to filing or dissemination to allow for meaningful comment by Parent.

 

 

(b) Stockholder Information. In connection with the Offer, promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to Parent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of Shares, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and shall reasonably promptly furnish Parent with such
additional information, including updated lists of stockholders, mailing
labels, security position listings and computer files, and such other
information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request for
the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders
of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger
Sub and their agents (i) shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated the Continuing Offer, and (ii) following the earlier of a Tender
Termination or the expiration of the Continuing Offer will, upon request of
the Company, deliver or destroy, and will use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their agents to deliver or destroy, to the Company all copies of
such information then in their possession or control.

1.3. Directors.

 

 

(a) Composition of Company Board and Board Committees. Promptly upon the
purchase of, and payment for, any Shares by Parent pursuant to the Offer
which represent at least such number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum
Condition, and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to
the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent, subject to
compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to
at least that number of directors which equals the product of the total
number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect
to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied
by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by
Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent and the Support Parties (including for
purposes of this Section 1.3(a) such Shares as are accepted for payment and
paid for pursuant to the Offer and Shares that are subject to options to
purchase Shares to the extent such options have been irrevocably exercised
and paid for by Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or any Support Party) bears
to the total number of Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (assuming
the issuance of all shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon the
vesting of outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock (as defined in
Section 6.1(b)), plus shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
all outstanding Company Stock Options, warrants and other rights to purchase
shares of Common Stock with an exercise price per share less than the Offer
Price; provided, however, that, in the event that Parent's designees are
appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company, then until the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
(a) cause at least three members of the Board of Directors of the Company on
the date of this Agreement (the "Existing Directors"), who are neither
officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders, affiliates or associates
(within the meaning of the Securities Laws) of Parent and who will be
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (one or more of
such directors, the "Independent Directors") to remain as directors, with the
three Independent Directors to be selected by a majority vote of the Existing
Directors and (b) to designate a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Independent Director Committee") and to continue the existence
of such Independent Director Committee until the Effective Time, which shall
be comprised solely of such Independent Directors and which shall, subject to
applicable Law, be delegated all power, right and authority of the Board of
Directors of the Company with respect to the Independent Director Committee
Actions; provided further, that if at any time there are in office fewer than
three (3) Independent Directors, the Board of Directors of the Company will
take all action necessary to cause a person or, if there are two (2)
vacancies, two (2) persons designated by the remaining Independent
Director(s) to fill such vacancy(ies) who shall be neither an officer of the
Company nor a designee, stockholder, affiliate or associate of Parent and who
will be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and
each such person shall be appointed to the Independent Director Committee and
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, or, if
no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate three
(3) persons to fill the vacancies who shall be neither an officer of the
Company nor a designee, stockholder, affiliate or associate of Parent and who
will be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and
each such person shall be appointed to the Independent Director Committee and
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. At each
such time, the Company will, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable
Laws (including, without limitation, the NYSE rules and regulations), also
cause each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (other than the
Independent Director Committee) to include persons designated by Parent
constituting at least the same percentage of each such committee as Parent's
designees constitute on the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company
shall, upon request by Parent, subject to the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, promptly increase the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company or exercise its best efforts to secure
the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable
Parent's designees to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Section 1.3(a) and shall cause Parent's
designees to be so elected. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall
promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.3(a). Parent will supply the Company any information
with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(b) Required Approvals of Independent Director Committee. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the time directors
designated by Parent are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of
the Company and prior to the Effective Time, the approval of the Independent
Director Committee, by a majority vote of its members, shall be required (i)
to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to waive or elect to enforce any
of the Company's rights or remedies under this Agreement (it being agreed
that the approval of the Independent Director Committee, by a majority vote
of its members, shall be the only approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company necessary to enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement and the Company's other rights and remedies
hereunder), (iii) to extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) to take any other
action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (v) to authorize any amendments to the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company in a manner adverse to the holders of
Shares, or (vi) to cease the Company's compliance with the continuing listing
requirements of the NYSE. The Independent Director Committee shall have the
authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company) and other advisors at the reasonable expense of the Company as
determined appropriate by the Independent Director Committee for the purpose
of fulfilling its obligations hereunder and shall have the authority, after
the Offer Closing, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (such
authority, together with the matters that require the approval of the
Independent Director Committee described in the first sentence of
this Section 1.3(b), being referred to as the "Independent Director
Committee Actions").

 

 

(c)   Section 14 of the Exchange Act. The Company shall mail to the holders
of Shares an information statement containing the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder (the
"Information Statement"), and the Company agrees to make such mailing
concurrently with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Parent and
Merger Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all
information required to be included in the Information Statement with respect
to such designees and with respect to Parent's officers, directors and
Affiliates).

 

 

(d) Effects on Continued Listing. Following the Offer Closing, the Company
shall, upon Parent's request, take all action reasonably necessary to elect
to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Rule 303A of the New
York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.

1.4. Top-Up Option.

 

 

(a) Top-Up Option Grant. The Company hereby grants to Parent an
irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase that number of Shares
(the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when
added to the number of Shares owned by Parent at the time of such exercise,
shall constitute one Share more than the number of Shares necessary for
Merger Sub to be merged into the Company without a vote or consent of
stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at a price per Share equal to the
Offer Price.

 

 

(b) Exercise of Top-Up. The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once
in whole and not in part within ten (10) business days after the date on
which Parent accepts for payment and pays for Shares pursuant to the Offer,
or such later date as any subsequent offering period for the Offer as
provided for under Section 1.1(d) may expire (the "Purchase Date");
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable and shall terminate on
the Purchase Date if the number of Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the
number of authorized but unissued Shares; and, provided, further, that
the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or upon any termination of the
Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(f).

 

 

(c) Top-Up Closing. In the event Parent wishes to exercise the Top-
Up Option, Parent shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth
in such notice (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent immediately
preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) the place and
time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the "Top-
Up Closing"). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, notify Parent in writing of the number of Shares
then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the Top-
Up Closing, Parent shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be
paid for the Top-Up Option Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to
Parent a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The
purchase price owed by Parent to the Company to purchase the Top-Up Option
Shares shall be paid to the Company at the Top-Up Closing, at Parent's
option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or (ii) by (x)
paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not
less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y)
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option
less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (the
"Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (A) shall be due on the
first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (B) shall bear simple interest of 5%
per annum, (C) shall be full recourse to Parent, (D) may be prepaid, in whole
or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (E) shall have no
other material terms.

 

 

(d) Exemption from Registration. Parent acknowledges that the Top-Up
Option Shares that Parent may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will
not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and
will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. Parent hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that Parent will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act. Parent agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Parent for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the
meaning of the Securities Act).

(e) No Effect on Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree and
acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to the Dissenting Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up
Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any cash or Promissory Note delivered by
Merger Sub to the Company in payment for such Top-Up Option Shares should be
considered in connection with the determination of the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

The Merger; Closing; Effective Time

 

 

2.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth
in Article III. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL and
in this Agreement.

 

 

2.2. Closing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company
and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York,

last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VIII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall
be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. The date on which
the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date".

 

 

2.3. Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger or certificate of
ownership and merger, as applicable, (in either case, the
"Delaware Certificate of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and
specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything contained in Section 7.4 to the
contrary, if after the consummation of the Offer Closing and the exercise of
the Top-Up Option, if applicable, Parent shall then hold of record, in the
aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, the parties hereto agree
to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as promptly as practicable without the vote or consent of
the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;

 

Exchange of Certificates

 

 

5.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the holder of any
capital stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

 

 

(a) Merger Consideration. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of Common
Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent and shares of Common Stock owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties (the "Affiliated Shares"), and (ii)
shares of Common Stock owned by stockholders ("Dissenting Stockholders") who
have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to,
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares of
Common Stock (the "Dissenting Shares," and together with the Affiliated
Shares, the "Excluded Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the "Per Share Merger
Consideration"), without interest. Except as provided in Section 5.1(b), at
the Effective Time, all of the shares of Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of the shares of
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such share of
Common Stock, without interest.

 

 

(b) Treatment of Excluded Shares. At the Effective Time, each Affiliated
Share shall not represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration and shall convert into one share of a class of stock of the
Surviving Corporation designated by Parent. Each Dissenting Share, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the
holder of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 5.2(g).

 

 

(c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

5.2. Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Paying Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company's
prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Common Stock, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make payments under Section 5.1(a) (such cash amount being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If a Dissenting Stockholder
effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its rights to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
(i) such shares of Common Stock shall cease to be Excluded Shares and (ii)
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its
demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
aggregate amounts payable under Section 5.1(a) shall be returned to
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 5.2(e). To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 5.1(a), Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments under Section 5.1(a).

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly (and in any event within two (2)
business days), after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of shares of Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 5.2(f)) to the Paying Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in customary form and to have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 5.2(f)) in exchange for the amount to which
such holder of shares of Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger
pursuant to Section 5.1(a). If any Excluded Shares cease to be an Excluded
Share pursuant to Section 5.2(a), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) after
such Excluded Shares cease to be an Excluded Share to mail to the holder of
such shares of Common Stock the letter of transmittal and instructions
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such
shares of Common Stock. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any
holder of shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed
and duly executed in accordance with its instructions and the surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such shares of Common Stock (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 5.2(f)), the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 5.2(h)) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares
of Common Stock represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 5.2(f)) and (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the
procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable
letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) Special Payment Procedures for DTC. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to ensure that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (such amount, the "DTC Payment"), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) business day after
the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to
the DTC Payment.

 

 

(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article V.

 

 

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of the shares of Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of
shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article V shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the amount to which such holder of shares of
Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 5.1(a)
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
5.2(h)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 5.2(f)), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Common Stock at such date as is immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or
interests of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this
Agreement, (i) the term "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,
Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature (including any

shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving

provided in Section 5.2(h)) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and
(ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the

consideration otherwise payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock
cancelled in the Merger such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of shares of Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect);

Stock were subject to outstanding options to purchase shares of Common Stock
(such outstanding options, together with any options to purchase shares of
Common Stock granted after December 9, 2010, under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise, the "Company Stock Options"). As of the date hereof, one Right
is associated with each share of Common Stock and each Right entitles the
holder thereof to purchase, under certain circumstances provided for in the
Rights Agreement, 1/100th of a share of Participating Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01, or, under certain circumstances provided for in the Rights
Agreement, a number of shares of Common Stock or other securities or assets

other phantom stock unit awards granted after December 9, 2010, the
"Phantom Stock Units" and, together with the Company Restricted Stock, the
Company Stock Options and the Company Performance Awards, the
"Company Equity Awards"). The exercise price per share of Common Stock under
each Option was equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the applicable grant date thereof. None of the
Subsidiaries of the Company owns any shares of Common Stock. Except as set
forth above in this Section 6.1(b)(i) and except for the Rights, there are
no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, performance units, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of
any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving

"Company Joint Venture"). Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity securities of each of the Company's Subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, except for
such failures as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The ownership interest
of the Company in each Subsidiary and interest of the Company in each Company
Joint Venture is owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a "Lien") except for
transfer restrictions of general applicability as provided under the
Securities Act and other applicable securities Laws. For purposes of this
Agreement, a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall include any
Subsidiary of the Company of which all of the shares of capital stock are

into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 

 

(iv) Except for the Rights Agreement, this Agreement and the Support
Agreement, there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other

financing or similar instruments issued for the benefit of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except for outstanding undrawn letters of credit that

the Credit Agreement are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A, Credit
Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch and ABN AMRO BANK N.V.

 

 

(c) Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness.

 

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and has taken all corporate action necessary to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, if required by applicable Law, subject only to, assuming the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section
6.2(h) are true and correct, adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a
stockholders' meeting duly called and held for such purpose or acting by
written consent in lieu of a stockholders' meeting (the "Company Requisite
Vote"), to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company

modified or withdrawn as of the time of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, by vote of those directors present, (A) each of the Special
Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the
Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company

Committee recommendation, the "Company Recommendation"), and (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company has directed that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for
their adoption at a stockholders' meeting duly called and held for such
purpose. As of the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company has received the opinion of each of Goldman Sachs and Co. and Greenhill
and Co., Inc. (such opinions, the "Fairness Opinions"), to the effect that, as
of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the $5.50 in cash to be received in the Offer
and the Merger by holders of Shares is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders. It is agreed and understood that such opinion is for the
benefit of the Company's Board of Directors and may not be relied on by
Parent or Merger Sub.

(h) Employee Benefits

 

 

(i) No Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Company Plan")
has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302
of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), or failed to timely satisfy the
minimum funding standard (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or
Sections 412 and 430 of the Code), in each case whether or not waived. All
contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Plan on or
before the date hereof have been made and all obligations in respect of each
Company Plan as of the date hereof have been accrued and reflected in the
Company Financial Statements to the extent required by GAAP. Under each Title
IV Company Plan which is a single-employer plan, the financial statements
filed with the Form 5500 most recently filed with the Internal Revenue
Service (including the related notes and schedules) for such Company Plan
fairly presented the financial condition of such Company Plan in all material
respects as of the last day of the plan year covered by such Form 5500, and
there has been no material change in the financial condition, whether or not
as a result of a change in funding method, of such Company Plan since the end
of such plan year. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Plans" shall
mean all "employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA), including each multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA and all employment, or change in control, deferred compensation,
bonus or other incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option and other

workers' compensation, short-term and long-term disability, vacation, and all
other employee benefit programs, policies, agreements or arrangements; each
severance, retention or termination pay, medical, surgical, hospitalization,
life insurance and other "welfare plan," fund or program (within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")); each profit-sharing, stock bonus or other "pension plan,"
fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA); each
employment, termination or severance contract, arrangement, policy or
agreement; and each other employee benefit plan, fund, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement; (i) that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to
or required to be contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is deemed a "single employer"
under Section 4001(b) of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate"), for the benefit of
any current or former employee or director of the Company (the
"Company Employees"), (ii) to which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is a
party, or (iii) under which Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with
respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
contingent liability.

 

 

(ii) (A) No material tax, fine, lien, penalty, or other liability under Title
IV of ERISA, the Code, or other applicable laws, rules and regulations has
been incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full and, no event has occurred and
no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability,
other than liability for premiums due to the Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corporation (the "PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due) and (B) no
material assets of the Company are or would reasonably be expected to be
subject to a lien pursuant to the Code or ERISA with respect to any Company
Plan. No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA for which the reporting requirement has not been waived or extended,
other than pursuant to PBGC Reg. Section 4043.33 or 4043.66, has been
required to be filed for any Company Plan within the twenty-four (24) month
period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(iii) No Company Plan provides welfare coverage that extends after the
termination of employment other than for continued coverage provided pursuant
to the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or other similar provision
of state law and each Company Plan providing such coverage may be amended,
modified or terminated after the Effective Time without cost or liability
other than for claims for expenses actually incurred prior to the date of
such amendment, modification or termination, and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any current or projected liability in
respect of post-employment or post-retirement health, medical, or life
insurance benefits for current, former, or retired employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(iv) No Title IV Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Company Plan a plan
described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

 

 

(v) There is no present intention that any Company Plan be materially
amended, suspended, or terminated, or otherwise modified to materially change
benefits (or the levels thereof) under any Company Plan at any time within
the twelve (12) months immediately following the date hereof. Each Company
Plan has been established, operated, and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including ERISA and
the Code. As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Company
Plans. No transaction has occurred with respect to any Company Plan that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material
tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA, in
any such case, in an amount which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(vi) Each Company Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code has received an affirmative
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to its
qualification. No event has occurred, whether by action or failure to act,
and no conditions or circumstances exist, that could be reasonably likely to
result in the loss of the qualification of such Company Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. For each Company Plan with respect to which a Form 5500
has been filed, no material change has occurred with respect to the matters
covered by the most recent Form since the date thereof.

 

 

(vii) There are no pending, or threatened, claims by or on behalf of any
Company Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any Company Plan,
or otherwise involving any Company Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits). No facts or circumstances exist that could be
reasonably likely to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims. No
written or oral communication has been received from the PBGC in respect of
any Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA concerning the funded status of
any such plan or any transfer of assets and liabilities from any such plan in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. With respect to the
Company Plans, the Company has not been notified (in writing or otherwise) of
any pending, threatened or in progress administrative investigation, audit,
or other administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the
Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agencies (including any
routine requests for information from the PBGC), and to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no such pending, threatened or in progress investigations,
audits or proceedings.

(viii)  Except as expressly described on Section 6.1(h)(viii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no Company Plan exists that, as a result of the execution
of this Agreement, the Offer, shareholder approval of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in
connection with any subsequent event(s)), could (A) entitle any Company
Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date of this Agreement, (B) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Company Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of the Company to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Company Plans, (D) cause the Company to record
additional compensation expense on its income statement with respect to any
outstanding stock option or other equity-based award, or (E) result in

Section 280G of the Code. No Company Plan provides for the gross-up
or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or otherwise.

the United States or is otherwise subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the United States or a political subdivision thereof.

(n) Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
may receive from the Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan and cost-
related plan information, regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans and cost-related plans, with which Parent and
Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans and cost-related plans, so
furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business
plans or cost-related plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no
claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that none of the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, agents or representatives, has made or is making any representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements, business plans or cost-related plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements, business plans or cost-related plans).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.2(n) or this
Agreement shall (i) relieve any Person of liability for fraud, (ii) prevent
Parent and Merger Sub from relying on the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement and any certificates delivered by the
Company in connection with this Agreement or (iii) be given effect in any
claim in respect of fraud.

initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposals or
offers from any Person or group of Persons with respect to any Acquisition

being understood that such confidentiality agreements need not prohibit the
making or amendment of a proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal); and
(ii) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Persons or groups of Persons
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist
or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions
or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(b) No Solicitation or Negotiation. Except as expressly permitted by
this Section 7.2, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and cause its
and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives to, (i) at 12:00 a.m. on January

(c) Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the last sentence of this

the earlier of the Offer Closing and the time Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, if the Company or any of its Representatives receives a written
Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did not result from a material
breach of Section 7.2(b), the Company and its Representatives may contact
such Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (i) the Company
and its Representatives may provide non-public information and data

confidentiality agreement on customary terms (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of an
Acquisition Proposal), (ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person and (iii)
after having complied with Section 7.2(e), the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof may authorize, adopt, approve, recommend, or

recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action
described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action could
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(y) in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in
clause (iii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or (ii) any
acquisition by any Person or group of Persons resulting in, or proposal or
offer to acquire by tender offer, share exchange or in any manner which if
consummated would result in, any Person or group of Persons becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, (A) more than 20% of the Shares then outstanding or of the
total voting power of the equity securities of the Company, (B) assets that
during the most recently completed twelve month period for which financial
information is available generated more than 20% of the consolidated total
revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) assets
constituting more than 20% of consolidated total assets, measured either by
book value or fair market value (including, equity securities of its
Subsidiaries), of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages
set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%), that the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has determined in
its good faith judgment (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all material legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal (including the financing thereof) and
the Person making the proposal, including the determination that the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal has available to it or can reasonably be
expected to be able to obtain funds on customary terms and that are
sufficient to consummate the Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if consummated,
would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders
from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including those stockholders, if any, who would remain
stockholders of the Company following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-52-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as
set forth in this Section 7.2(e), Section 7.2(f) or Section 9.3(a), the Board
of Directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not:

 

 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer or the
Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
or resolve to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that the Board of Directors may take no position with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business as of the tenth (10th)
business day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an
adverse modification); or

 

 

(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 9.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(c)) (an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the earlier of the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained and the Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof may, if the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to do so could be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify
the Company Recommendation, and (B) approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof determines in good faith is a Superior Proposal and
take action pursuant to Section 9.3(a) (clauses (A) and (B) collectively, a
"Change of Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Company shall not
(I) effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal
or (II) take any action pursuant to Section 9.3(a) with respect to a Superior
Proposal (collectively, the "Company Actions") unless (x) the Company
notifies Parent in writing, at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance, that
it intends to take the Company Action, which notice shall specify the
identity of the party who made such Superior Proposal and all of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach the most current
version of such agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; (y) after
providing such notice and prior to taking such Company Action, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such forty-eight (48) hour
period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Board of
Directors of the Company not to take the Company Action; and (z) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall have determined in good
faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be
given effect; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall
not take any Company Action prior to the time that is forty-eight (48) hours
after it has provided the written notice required by clause (x) above;
provided further, that in the event that the Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall provide written notice of such modified Acquisition Proposal
and shall again comply with this Section 7.2(e), except that the Company's
advance written notice obligation shall be reduced to twenty-four (24) hours
(rather than the forty-eight (48) hours otherwise contemplated by this
Section 7.2(e)) and the time the Company shall be permitted to take the
Company Action shall be reduced to the time that is twenty-four (24) hours
after it has provided such written notice (rather than the time that is the
forty-eight (48) hours otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.2(e)) (but in
no event prior to the original forty-eight (48) hour advance notice period).

(f) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 7.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company); provided, however, that
neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company (or any
committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the Company
stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange
offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal),
unless in each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) effects a Change of Recommendation in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (including Section 7.2(e) hereof); provided further
that any such disclosure (including a "stop, look and listen" communication
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the
Board of Directors of the Company expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation at least two (2) business days prior to the earlier of the
then-current Expiration Date (if the Offer has not been terminated pursuant

thereto or any change to the terms or conditions thereof) and the status of
any discussions or negotiations. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from

action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of any Shares
held by Parent or its Affiliates (other than High River Limited Partnership),
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as possible after the Offer
Closing without the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of

Parent shall permit any of its Affiliates, officers or any other
Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings with, or the prosecution of any filings with such
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger, and the other

(d) Required Approval Matters. Without limiting the generality of the
other undertakings pursuant to this Section 7.5 and subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company (in the case of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii)(A) and (iv) of this Section 7.5(d) set forth below)
and Parent (in all cases set forth below) agrees to take or cause to be taken
the following actions:

 

 

(i) to cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to satisfy the Tender Offer Conditions and the conditions set
forth in Article VIII and to consummate and make effective the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, and preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings,
including the Schedule TO, the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy
Statement and any other filings made by, or required to be made by, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC, and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits
and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
under the HSR Act, the FPA and the New York Public Service Law. In
furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company
each shall file the initial pre-merger notifications with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein required under the HSR Act
(which filing, including the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or
otherwise disclosed to the other party except to counsel of each party) and
the filings under the FPA and the New York Public Service Law, in each case,
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in all events
within five (5) business days after the date of this Agreement except, in the
case of the required application under the FPA, unless the parties have
previously submitted the amendment to the Prior Application at the time and
in the manner contemplated by Section 7.5(h)(ii). The Company and Parent will
each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the
Merger under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Offer, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement but subject to Section 7.5(a)). In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action
with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Acceleration
Time. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other
Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition;

(ii) to provide promptly to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over any Company Required
Governmental Approval, Parent Required Governmental Approval or otherwise
over the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a
"Governmental Approval Entity") such non-privileged information and documents
as reasonably requested by any such Governmental Approval Entity or that
are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(iii) to use its reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain promptly all Company
Required Governmental Approvals and Parent Required Governmental Approvals
and (B) avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination,
judgment, investigation or Law that would delay in any material respect,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and
agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale,
disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or
businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or either's respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with,
and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Approval Entity giving
effect thereto) if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or
threatened (x) commencement of any investigation or proceeding in any forum
or (y) issuance or enactment of any order, decree, decision,
determination, judgment or Law that would delay in any material respect,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental
Approval Entity;

 

 

(iv) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the Offer or the Merger, in each case, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer, the Merger, or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use its reasonable best
efforts to take any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting
of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (iii) of this
Section 7.5(d)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend,
prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement, as the case may be; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-59-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(v) to refrain from entering into any agreement, arrangement or other
understanding to acquire any assets or properties that would reasonably be
expected to (i) prevent or materially delay receipt of any Company
Required Governmental Approvals or the Parent Required Governmental Approvals
or (ii) prevent or materially delay Offer Closing or the Closing.

 

 

(e) Rule 14d-10(c) Matters. Prior to the Expiration Date and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, the Company (acting through its Board of Directors
and its compensation committee) will take all such steps as may be required
to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act
any employment compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that
have been or will be entered into by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees
of the Company and its Affiliates and to insure that any such arrangements
fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

 

 

(f) Competing Transactions. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent agrees
that it shall not, and shall not permit any of its "affiliates" (under and as
defined in the FPA and the rules and regulations of FERC promulgated
thereunder) acquire any securities of any other Person or any assets or any
other business if such acquisition would be reasonably expected to materially
impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(g) New York Public Service Law Application. In the event this Agreement is
terminated other than pursuant to a Tender Termination, the Company shall not
object to or move to delay Parent pursuing any necessary approval from the
New York Public Service Commission for the acquisition of Shares by Parent
(or its Affiliates) pursuant to a Continuing Offer, including any amendments
to an existing application or filing a new application. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(a) in connection with a Subsequent
Transaction, Parent agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with the Company to take all action to withdraw any, and shall not
until the Voting Termination Date make any additional, filings seeking
approval from the New York Public Service Commission for the acquisition of
Shares by Parent or any of its Affiliates.

this Agreement but in no event later than 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) on the
fifth business day following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
either (i) cause Icahn Partners LP, Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, Icahn
Partners Master Fund II LP, Icahn Partners Master Fund III LP and High River
Limited Partnership to make such filings with FERC as shall be necessary and
appropriate to withdraw the application in Docket No. EC11-22-000 filed by
them under the FPA on November 22, 2010 (the "Prior Application") or (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable law, amend the Prior Application to join
the Company as an applicant thereto and have the Prior Application seek
approval of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated other than pursuant
to a Tender Termination, the Company shall not object to: (i) any amendment
to the Prior Application to remove the Company as an applicant thereto, or
(ii) Parent pursuing any necessary FERC approvals, including pursuant to the
Prior Application or any other application, in each of clauses (i) and (ii),
in connection with a Continuing Offer. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.3(a) in connection with a Subsequent Transaction,
Parent agrees it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the
Company to take all action to withdraw any, and shall not until the Voting
Termination Date make any additional, filings under the FPA regarding the
acquisition of Shares by Parent or its Affiliates.

7.6. Access and Reports. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable prior
written notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parent's officers and other Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period from the date hereof and though
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, facilities, books, contracts and records and,
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties, facilities, operations and personnel as may reasonably be
requested, including without limitation, to facilitate the preparation of the
Environmental Report by the Environmental Consultant, provided that
no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall affect or be deemed
to modify or supplement any representation or warranty made by the Company
herein, and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the
Company (a) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts
to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in any such
disclosure, including obtaining the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure or (b) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the Company shall have used reasonable
best efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in
the loss of such privilege. The scope of work for the Environmental Report
may include Phase I protocols, but shall not include (A) any soil,
groundwater, or other invasive testing or sampling or (B) any contacts with
or inquiries to any Governmental Entity. The Company shall use best efforts
to immediately assist Parent and Environmental Consultant in obtaining
publicly available information from any federal, state or local regulatory
agency, as requested by Parent or Environmental Consultant. All requests for
information made pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall be directed to a Person
designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the
terms of Section 7.19. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the
date of this Agreement until the No-Shop Period Start Date, Parent, Merger
Sub and their Representatives shall not (or, to the extent provided prior to
the date of this Agreement, shall cease to) furnish any information, in any
form or medium, written or oral, concerning or relating to the Company and
its Affiliates that is furnished to or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub by
or on behalf of the Company prior to, on or after the date hereof, and also
including, all notes, analyses, studies, interpretations, memoranda and other
documents, material or reports (in any form or medium) prepared by Parent,
Merger Sub that contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or part, such
information (collectively, the "Evaluation Material") to any Person in
connection with such Person's (A) potential investment in Parent or its
Affiliates or (B) evaluation of the acquisition of assets of the Company in
connection with or following the Closing (the actions contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), a "Third Party Investment"). From and after
the No-Shop Period Start Date, Parent and Merger Sub may furnish Evaluation
Material to any Person in connection with a Third Party Investment, provided,
that Parent shall have directed such Person to treat any Evaluation Material
provided to such Person in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of
Section 7.19 and to perform or to comply with the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub with respect to any such Evaluation Material as contemplated by
Section 7.19. Parent agrees that it will be fully responsible for any
breach of any of the provisions of Section 7.19 by any such Person as though
it were a "Representative" under Section 7.19 unless such Person executes
a confidentiality agreement with the Company on customary terms
and conditions. In connection with a Third Party Investment, the
Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement or consummation of a Third Party Investment as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including with respect to any customary due
diligence review of such assets that may be requested by Parent such as
visits of properties and facilities of the Company and meeting with
appropriate personnel of the Company (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of any Third Party Investment
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 7.6) and any
information utilized in connection therewith. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that any Third Party Investment is not a condition to
Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of any Third Party Investment, subject to fulfillment or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VIII.

7.7. [Reserved].

 

 

7.8. Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred or in connection with Section 7.2(f)) the Company
and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity.

 

 

7.9. Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Acceleration Time
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those subject to collectively-
bargained agreements) who continue employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, after the Acceleration Time
("Affected Employees") will be provided, unless their employment has ceased,
with total annual cash compensation opportunities and benefits that, taken
together, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those total annual
cash compensation opportunities and benefits provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceleration Time. Following the
Acceleration Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall comply with, or the
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent to comply with, as applicable, the
provisions of each of the Company's change in control severance plans.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-62-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans which the Affected
Employees are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder (other than any benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan), service for the Company and
its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such
service was credited under the comparable plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits). Parent shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Affected Employee
under any welfare benefit plan in which an Affected Employee is eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the extent such limitations,
conditions, and waiting periods were satisfied or inapplicable under the
comparable welfare benefit plan and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for
any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to
the Effective Time under the terms of any corresponding Company Plan in
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
requirements for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs under any
welfare benefit plan in which the Affected Employee participates on and after
the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) For all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those
subject to collectively-bargained agreements) who continue employment with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
applicable, through the earlier of March 15, 2011, and the date on which the
Company otherwise pays annual bonuses and incentive payments (the
"Continuing Employees") in the ordinary course of business (the "2011 Bonus
Payment Date"), bonuses and incentive payments shall be paid to such
Continuing Employees on the 2011 Bonus Payment Date in accordance with
the Company's short-term incentive plan and historical past practices;
provided that Parent shall ensure that the aggregate annual bonuses and
incentive payments made to all Continuing Employees, measured as a group, in
respect of the 2010 calendar year are no less than the aggregate amount
accrued therefor as of December 31, 2010 for such Continuing Employees.

 

 

(d) [Reserved].

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-63-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges and recognizes that, as of the Acceleration
Time, all of the Company's and/or the Company's Affiliates' contractual
obligations with the unions representing bargaining unit employees of the
Company or its Affiliates will continue, including all contractual
obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements, as listed in
Section 7.9(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to future bargaining
between the unions and the Company or the Company's Affiliates).

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (ii) give any third
party (including any employee or dependent or beneficiary of any employee or
trustee) any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.9 or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to
retain the employment of any particular employee for any period of time or to
maintain any particular Company Plan or benefit, except to the extent
otherwise required by Section 7.9(c) with respect to the bonuses and
incentive payments.

 

 

7.10.   Expenses. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article V. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 9.5, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer or the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such expense, except for Parent's reimbursement
and indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 7.6 and Section 7.14.

 

 

7.11. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

 

 

(a) From and after the Acceleration Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance thereto expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each present
and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties' service
as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services
performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Offer Closing or the Effective Time, if such Indemnified Party
acted in good faith and in a manner such Indemnified Party reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, such Indemnified Party had no reasonable cause to believe such
Indemnified Party's conduct was unlawful, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

(b) Prior to the Acceleration Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the
Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the
Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect
to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Company's existing policies with respect to any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided that the cost of
the annual premium amount for such "tail" insurance policies does not exceed
an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance; provided, further, that prior to the Company obtaining
and fully paying for such DandO Insurance Policies, the Company shall consult
with Parent regarding the procurement of such policies from an insurer with a
claims rating at least equal to such rating for the Company's current
provider of DandO Insurance and shall permit Parent's insurance advisor to
participate in the process of negotiating such insurance and seeking to
obtain such insurance on the most cost effective basis, and such insurance
shall not be purchased unless the Company has provided at least 5 business
days prior written notice to Parent; it being understood and agreed that if
the Parent's insurance advisor is able to obtain for the Company insurance
that is less expensive but in all material respects equal to, the insurance
proposed to be purchased by the Parent, then the Company will acquire such
less expensive insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such insurance policies as of the Acceleration Time
or the Effective Time, as applicable, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the
date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as
provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof; provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and provided, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
7.11.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are
third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.11.

 

 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or
Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Offer and the Merger and shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

 

7.12. Takeover Statutes. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Offer, the Continuing Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any Takeover Statute is or
may become applicable to the Offer, the Continuing Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board
of Directors shall promptly grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
promptly act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

 

 

7.13. Parent Ownership and Vote.

 

 

(a) Parent agrees that from the date hereof until the Voting Termination
Date, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (each, a "Support Party")
will directly or indirectly (i) sell, assign, transfer, tender, pledge,
encumber or otherwise dispose of (collectively, "Transfer") any of the Parent
Shares to a third party, (ii) deposit any of the Parent Shares into a voting
trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to the
Parent Shares or, subject to Section 7.13(b), grant any proxy,
written consent or power of attorney with respect thereto that is
inconsistent with this Section 7.13, (iii) enter into any Contract, option or
other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect
Transfer of any Parent Shares to a third party, or (iv) Transfer, acquire or
agree, offer, seek or propose to acquire any Shares, or Equity Interests,
debt securities or notes or Indebtedness of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries or other right to acquire such ownership, including through any
swap agreement or other security, contract right or derivative position,
whether or not presently exercisable, that has an exercise or conversion
privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the
value of the Shares or Equity Interests or a value determined in whole or
part with reference to, or derived in whole or in part from, the value of the
Shares or the Equity Interests and that increases in value as the value of
the Shares or Equity Interests increases or that provides to the holder
an opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit
derived from any increase in the value of the Shares or Equity Interests of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Time, (b) such efforts do not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (c) none of the Company

Company with respect to such information.

 

 

(b) Upon any termination of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly return to the Company or destroy and, upon the Company's written
request, promptly certify in writing that such return or destruction has

public information included in the Environmental Report and the Pension
Termination Liability and Pension Asset Value analysis (the

with a letter from counsel for the Company (who may be inside counsel)
indicating that such counsel has reviewed the Reports and the Company's
public disclosures and is not aware of any non-public information in the
Reports that the Company would be required to disclose if the Company were
selling or purchasing its own securities in the market. If the Company fails
to provide this letter from counsel within such five (5) business day period,
Parent may disclose any portion of the Reports that it concludes should be
disclosed to assure that Parent is not in possession of material non-public
information.

8.3. Conditions to Obligation of the Company. Solely to the extent the Offer
Closing shall not have occurred, the obligation of the Company to effect the
Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company at or
prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

 

 

(a) Representations and Warranties. (i) The representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in
all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent
that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier
date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct does
not materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) the Company shall have received at the Closing a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent by a senior executive officer of
Parent to the effect that such officer has read this Section 8.3(a) and the
conditions set forth in this Section 8.3(a) have been satisfied.

 

 

(b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed
on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by a senior executive officer of Parent to
such effect.

 

 

(c) Regulatory Consents. (i) The waiting period applicable to
the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated
or shall have expired, and (ii) the Company Required Governmental Approvals
set forth on Section 8.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall have
been obtained and such approvals shall have become Final Orders.

 

 

8.4. Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2
or 8.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied to excuse such party's obligation
to effect the Merger if such failure was caused by such party's failure to
use the standard of efforts required from such party to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as
required by and subject to Section 7.5.

 

 

ARTICLE IX

(such date, as it may be extended pursuant to this Section 9.2,
the "Termination Date"); provided, that if on February 28, 2011 any of the

stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 8.1(a)); provided, that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall not
be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation or other
breach under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or the primary
factor that resulted in, the failure of any Tender Offer Condition or a
condition to the consummation of the Merger to have been satisfied on or
before the Termination Date.

 

 

9.3. Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned by the Company:

 

 

(a) at any time prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing and the time the
Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof authorizes the Company, subject to complying

-75-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, which inaccuracy or breach would give rise to a failure of any
condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b), and such breach or condition
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (A)
thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof is given by the
Company to Parent or (B) two (2) business days prior to the Termination Date;
provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 9.3(b) if it is in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder and has
received notice of such breach from Parent and been provided ten days to cure
such breach and has not cured such breach within the 10 day period from the
date of such notice;

 

 

(c) if (i) all of the Tender Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or

(d) if Parent fails to commence the Offer by December 22, 2010 or terminates
or makes any change to the Offer in violation of the terms of this Agreement
in any material respect.

 

 

9.4. Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
and, if applicable, the Offer, may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time by Parent:

 

 

(a) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (i)
shall have made and not withdrawn a Change of Recommendation, (ii) shall have
approved or recommended to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) fails (or the Company fails) to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 14D-9; or

 

 

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation
and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, which
breach or inaccuracy (x) if the Offer has been terminated in accordance with
Section 1.1(f), would give rise to a failure of any condition set forth in
Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) or (y) if the Offer shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Section 1.1(f), would give rise to a failure of any Tender
Offer Condition set forth in clauses (3) or (4) set forth in Exhibit A, and
in each case, such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured prior to the earlier of (A) thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company or (B) two (2) business days
prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.4(b) if it is in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
hereunder and has received notice of such breach from Company and been
provided 10 days to cure such breach and has not cured such breach within the
10-day period from the date of such notice.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-76-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) if the Environmental Report concludes that the Company is subject to a
Material Environmental Obligation ("MEO") and Parent shall have provided
written notice to the Company of such determination on or before January 17,
2011. A MEO shall be an obligation for the Company to comply with
Environmental Laws as in effect and interpreted on the date hereof that will
result in the Company incurring environmental capital expenditures between
January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013 (the "Measurement Period") plus
environmental liabilities as accrued on the Company's September 30, 2010
balance sheet included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2010 (as defined and interpreted in accordance with GAAP,
except that: (i) where there is a range of reasonably possible costs and
outcomes, the Environmental Consultant shall determine the most credible cost
which shall be the basis for the calculations hereunder, and (ii) for
purposes of whether a cost to be incurred is estimable, in the opinion of the
Environmental Consultant, where it is more likely than not that the cost will
be incurred), such that individually or in the aggregate, such costs are more
than $250 million in excess of the $395 million currently projected by the
Company, in the Company's additional definitive soliciting materials filed on
Schedule 14A with the SEC on November 18, 2010 and the Company's September
30, 2010 balance sheet included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2010, for such required expenditures and
accruals, taking into account the ability to mitigate such expenditures and
accruals through commercially reasonable operational adjustments, such as
fuel switching or decommissioning of facilities, provided however, that no
more than 25% of the baseload generating capacity can be decommissioned .
Parent shall base its assessment of relevant environmental capital
expenditure requirements and environmental liabilities as accrued on the
Company's balance sheet on the conclusions of a written environmental report
prepared by a reputable, nationally recognized environmental consulting firm
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
("Environmental Consultant"), and which has been provided to the Company for
comment at least three business days in advance of Parent providing any
notice to the Company pursuant to this Section 9.4(c) (the
"Environmental Report"). Company agrees that MACTEC, TRC, or URS are
all acceptable as the Environmental Consultant. No invasive soil
or groundwater sampling shall be permitted in connection with preparation of
the Environmental Report or otherwise under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) if the Pension Termination Liability less the Pension Asset Value exceeds
$250 million; provided, that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.4(d) unless it has delivered written
notice of such termination to the Company on or prior to January 17, 2011.
For purposes of this Section 9.4(d), "Pension Termination Liability" means
the aggregate PBGC termination liability as of December 31, 2010 for the
Company's Title IV Company Plans as determined in accordance with Section
4044 of ERISA and related regulations and the assumptions set forth on
Section 9.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and "Pension Asset Value"
means the aggregate fair market value of the assets in the trusts for the
Company's Title IV Company Plans as of November 30, 2010. For the avoidance
of doubt, the first sentence of this Section shall be deemed to have occurred
if the consequences of effecting a standard termination of the Title IV
Company Plans in accordance with Section 4041(b) ERISA, including the cost of
purchasing distribution annuities and paying related administrative costs,
requires additional contributions to the Title IV Company Plans of more than
$250 million, in the aggregate.

9.5. Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

 

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IX, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); provided, however, and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, that (i) except as otherwise provided herein no such
termination shall relieve the Company of any liability to pay the Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 9.5, (ii) except as otherwise provided herein,
no such termination will relieve any party hereto of any liability to the
other party hereto for any breach of this Agreement, (iii) no such
termination shall affect the approval of the Continuing Offer by the Board
for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and such approval shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent the Continuing Offer continues to
constitute a Continuing Offer, and (iv) this Section 9.5 and Article X shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) In the event that:

 

 

(i) (x) before obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (the section relating to the
Termination Date), or Section 9.2(b) (the section relating to failure to
receive stockholder approval) and (y) within eighteen (18) months of such
termination the Company shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal
(provided that for purposes of this clause (y) the references to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%") as a result of which the holders of Shares shall be entitled to
receive, either directly or indirectly, consideration (whether cash or
otherwise) having an aggregate value of more than $5.50 per Share;

 

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(a) (the
section relating to Parent's right to terminate for a Change of
Recommendation) or by Parent or the Company pursuant to another provision of
Article IX at a time when Parent had the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to 9.4(a); or

 

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
(the section relating to an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal);

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-78-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iv) (x) before obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (the section relating to the
Termination Date), or Section 9.2(b) (the section relating to failure to
receive stockholder approval), (y) any Person shall have made or publicly
announced a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement
but prior to such termination, and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have
been publicly withdrawn without qualification in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the receipt of the Company
Requisite Vote in any material respect at least ten (10) calendar days prior
to, with respect to Section 9.2(a), the date of termination, or at least five
(5) business days prior to, with respect to a termination pursuant to Section
9.2(b), the Stockholders Meeting and (z) within eighteen (18) months of such
termination the Company shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (y) of this Section 9.5(b)(iv)) (provided that for
purposes of this clause (z) the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

 

 

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) above, within three (3)
business days after the date on which the Company consummates the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in sub-clause (i)(y), (B) in the case of clause (ii)
above, no later than three (3) business days after the date of such
termination, (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or
concurrently with such termination, and (D) in the case of clause (iv) above,
within three (3) business days after the date the Company consummates the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in sub-clause (iv)(z); pay Merger Sub or its
designee the Termination Fee (as defined below) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion).
"Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $16.3 million less any Parent
Expenses previously paid by the Company.

 

 

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement by (i) either party
pursuant to Section 9.2(b) (or a termination by the Company pursuant to a
different section of Section 9.2 at a time when this Agreement was terminable
pursuant to Section 9.2(b)) or (ii) Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(b), then
the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) business
days after being notified of such by Parent pay Merger Sub or its designee in
respect of expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and as consideration for entering into this
Agreement an amount equal to $5 million (the "Parent Expenses") by wire
transfer of same day funds.

 

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 9.5 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 9.5(b) or Section 9.5(c) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 9.5(b) or Section
9.5(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub
its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment.

THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW
PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the

AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES

that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The parties acknowledge and agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and

terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement. Each party hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

(d) The parties further agree that (x) the seeking of the remedies provided

in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that
the remedies provided for in Section 10.5(c) are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require
any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under Section 10.5(c)
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article IX
(and pursuing damages after such termination, which the parties acknowledge
and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost
by a party's stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including the transaction premium, other transaction opportunities and the
time value of money)), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding
pursuant to Section 10.5(c) or anything set forth in this Section 10.5(d)
restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

10.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Subject to Section 10.5(d), except (i)
as provided in Section 7.11 (Indemnification; Directors' and
Officers' Insurance), (ii) only with respect to stockholders and only after
the Effective Time, for the provisions set forth in Article V and (iii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws, Parent and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 7.11 shall
not arise unless and until the Acceleration Time occurs. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with Section 10.3 without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

 

10.9. Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

 

10.10. Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation when due.

 

 

10.11. Definitions. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 

 

10.12. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

10.13. Interpretation; Construction. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." All pronouns and all
variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or
neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may require. Where
a reference in this Agreement is made to any agreement (including this
Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such references are to, except
as context may otherwise require, the agreement, contract, statute or
regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time
to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by
the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation including
any successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to "dollars" or "$" in
this Agreement are to United States dollars.

 

 

(a) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

 

10.14. Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise without the written consent of each of the parties hereto;
provided, however, that prior to the mailing of the Offer Documents to the
Company's stockholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a
Constituent Corporation and serve as purchaser pursuant to the Offer in lieu
of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be
deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations
and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; provided that any
such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise adversely affect the ability of holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Offer Price and/or Per Share Merger Consideration. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

 

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, Parent shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (relating to Parent's obligation to pay for or return tendered
Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for
payment or paid for) if (i) there shall not be validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date for the Offer that number of
Shares which, when added to any Shares already owned by Parent, its
Subsidiaries and the Support Parties (and for this purpose, Parent, its
Subsidiaries and the Support Parties shall be deemed to own Shares that
are subject to options to purchase Shares to the extent such options have
been irrevocably exercised and paid for by any of them prior to the
Expiration Date), represents at least a majority of the outstanding Shares on
a fully diluted basis as of the Expiration Date of the Offer (assuming the
issuance of all Shares that may be issued upon the vesting of outstanding
Company Restricted Stock, plus Shares issuable upon the exercise of all
outstanding Company Stock Options, warrants and other rights to purchase
Shares with an exercise price per Share less than the Offer Price) (such
condition, the "Minimum Condition"), or (ii) at any time on or after the date
of the commencement of the Offer and prior to the Expiration Date, any of the
following events shall occur and be continuing:

 

 

(1) An Order by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction,

shall have been issued and be continuing in effect;

effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications
set forth therein) shall not be true and correct as of the date of the
Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
and time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall, subject to the qualifications below, not be true and correct
as of such earlier date) except where the failures of any such
representations and warranties to be so not true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; or (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in (x)
Section 6.1(b)(i), Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(k) of the Agreement shall
not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement and
as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date and time
(except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly
speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall not be true and correct as of such earlier date and except, with
respect to the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 6.1(b)(i) of the Agreement, for such inaccuracies as are de
minimis relative to Section 6.1(b)(i) taken as a whole) or (y) Section
6.1(f)(i) of the Agreement shall not be true and correct without disregarding
the Company Material Adverse Effect qualification contained therein as of the
date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as
of such date and time (except to the extent that any such representation and
warranty expressly speaks of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date);

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ex. A-1

obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or prior to
the Expiration Date; or

 

 

(5) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by a senior executive officer of the Company stating that (i) the
Company's representations and warranties are true and correct in the manner
specified in clause (3) of this Exhibit A, and (ii) the Company has performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date;

 

 

(6) (i) The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Offer under
the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated, (ii) the approval of
the FERC under Section 203 of the FPA shall not have been received, or (iii)
the approval, or a determination that no approval is required, of the NYPSC
under the New York Public Service Law, as amended, shall not have been
received with respect to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
(collectively, the "Regulatory Condition");

 

 

The foregoing conditions shall be for the benefit of Parent and may be
asserted by Parent regardless of the circumstances (including any action or
inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, other than action or inaction in breach of
the Agreement) giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in each case except
for the Minimum Condition and the Regulatory Condition, in the exercise of
the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent and subject to the terms of the
Agreement, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure
by Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right may be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in each case except
for the Minimum Condition and the Regulatory Condition, in the exercise of
the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent and subject to the terms of the
