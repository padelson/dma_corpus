"Notice of Adjustment Disagreement" thereunder given in accordance with the
provisions thereof by Parent or the Stockholder, a " _Bank Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement_ "). A Notice of Adjustment Disagreement or Bank
Notice of Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the notifying partys
adjustments to the Closing Statement or Bank Closing Statement with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation. If no Notice of Adjustment Disagreement is
received by Parent on or prior to the expiration date of the Adjustment
Review Period, then the Closing Statement and all amounts set forth therein
shall be deemed to have been accepted by Parent Bank and the Stockholder and
shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto and to the Bank
Merger Agreement. If no Bank Notice of Adjustment Disagreement is received by
Parent Bank on or prior to the expiration date of the Adjustment Review
Period, then the Bank Closing Statement and all amounts set forth therein
shall be deemed to have been accepted by Parent and the Stockholder and shall
become final and binding upon the parties to the Bank Merger Agreement. During
the thirty (30) days immediately following the later of the timely delivery of
a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement and a Bank Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement, if any, (the " _Adjustment Resolution Period_ "), Parent, the
Stockholder and Parent Bank shall seek in good faith to resolve any
disagreement that any of them may have with respect to the matters specified
in such Notice of Adjustment Disagreement or Bank Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement. Any items relating to the Closing Statement agreed to by each of
the Stockholder, Parent and Parent Bank in writing, together with any
items relating to the Closing Statement not disputed or objected to by either
the Stockholder or Parent Bank in a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_ ". Any items
relating to the Bank Closing Statement agreed to by each of the Stockholder,
Parent and Parent Bank in writing, together with any items relating to the
Bank Closing Statement not disputed or objected to by either the Stockholder
or Parent in a Bank Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Bank Resolved Matters_ ". If at the end of the
Adjustment Resolution Period the parties have been unable to resolve any
differences they may have with respect to the matters specified in a Notice
of Adjustment Disagreement or a Bank Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, the
Stockholder, Parent and Parent Bank shall refer all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (the "
_Unresolved Matters_ ") or the Bank Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (the "
_Bank Unresolved Matters_ ") to an independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the
Stockholder, Parent and Parent Bank (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") as
promptly as practicable. In the event the Stockholder, Parent and Parent Bank
are unable to reasonably agree to an Independent Accountant within
fifteen (15) days after the end of the Adjustment Resolution Period, the
"Independent Accountant" shall be an independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of national recognition selected by the mutual
agreement of (x) a certified public accounting firm in the United States
appointed by the Stockholder in its sole discretion, (y) a certified public
accounting firm in the United States appointed by Parent in its sole
discretion and (z) a certified public accounting firm in the United States
appointed by Parent Bank in its sole discretion. Within thirty (30) days after
the submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant, the
Independent 

 



-13-  Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final
determination, binding on the parties hereto and to the Bank Merger Agreement,
of the appropriate amount of each of the Unresolved Matters and Bank
Unresolved Matters. With respect to each Unresolved Matter and Bank Unresolved
Matter, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of the
Stockholder, Parent or Parent Bank, shall not be in excess of the highest,
nor less than the lowest, of the amounts advocated (i) by the Stockholder or
Parent Bank in a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement or Parent in the Closing
Statement with respect to such Unresolved Matter and (ii) by the
Stockholder or Parent in a Bank Notice of Adjustment Disagreement or Parent
Bank in the Bank Closing Statement with respect to such Bank Unresolved
Matter. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not
review any line items in the Closing Statement or Bank Closing Statement or
make any determination with respect to any matter other than the Unresolved
Matters and Bank Unresolved Matters. During the review by the Independent
Accountant, Parent Bank, the Stockholder and Parent shall each make available
to the Independent Accountant such individuals and such information, books,
records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent
Accountant to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.3(c) and
under Section 2.4(c) of the Bank Merger Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the independent accountants of Parent Bank, the Stockholder or Parent
shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent
Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants. The costs of the Independent Accountant shall be split equally
between the party or parties that have submitted a Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement under this Agreement or a Bank Notice of Adjustment Disagreement
under the Bank Merger Agreement that has resulted in one or more Unresolved
Matters or Bank Unresolved Matters. With respect to any Unresolved Matter and
Bank Unresolved Matter that involves the same or substantially similar line
items in the Closing Statement or Bank Closing Statement, or any
other matters that are the same or substantially related as between the
Closing Statement and the Bank Closing Statement, the Independent Accountant
shall make a consistent determination with respect thereto. Any amounts, line
items and calculations included in Tangible Book Value (as defined in the
Bank Merger Agreement) or Adjusted Closing Tangible Book Value that involve
the same or substantially similar items or determinations as those made by the
Independent Valuation Firm and set forth in the Independent Valuation Firm
Initial Closing Statement, as modified by the Independent Valuation Firm Final
Closing Statement, shall be consistent with the determinations and
calculations of the Independent Valuation Firm, and none of the parties to
this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement shall dispute any such amounts
determined by the Independent Valuation Firm in any submission to the
Independent Accountant.

 

(d) The " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no Notice
of Adjustment Disagreement is delivered to Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(c)
prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period, the Closing Statement
delivered by Parent to the Stockholder and Parent Bank pursuant to Section
2.3(b), (ii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement is
delivered to Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(c) prior to the expiration of the
Adjustment Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the
Stockholder and Parent Bank pursuant to Section 2.3(b) as adjusted pursuant
to the agreement of Parent, the Stockholder and Parent Bank in writing or
(iii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement is delivered to
Parent pursuant to Section 

 



-14-  2.3(c) prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period and Parent,
the Stockholder and Parent Bank are unable to agree on all matters set forth
in such Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, the Closing Statement delivered by
Parent to the Stockholder and Parent Bank pursuant to Section 2.3(b) as
adjusted by the Independent Accountant to be consistent with the Resolved
Matters and the final determination of the Independent Accountant of the
Unresolved Matters in accordance with Section 2.3(c). The date on which the
Final Closing Statement is finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.3(d) is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_ ".

(e) As of the Determination Date, the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to
mean an amount (the " _Final Cash Consideration_ ") in cash without interest
equal to $3,000,000,000, __less__ the Closing Tangible Book Value Adjustment
Amount, if any, __less__ the Transaction Expenses, in each case as set forth
in the Final Closing Statement and as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section
1.5(b). Within five (5) business days after the Determination Date, (i) if the
Estimated Cash Consideration paid at the Closing exceeds the Final
Cash Consideration, the Stockholder shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
the entire amount of such excess by wire transfer or transfers of immediately
available funds from the Stockholder to an account designated by Parent and
(ii) if the Final Cash Consideration exceeds the Estimated Cash Consideration
paid at the Closing, Parent or the Company shall pay to the Stockholder an
amount equal to the entire amount of such excess by wire transfer or transfers
of immediately available funds from Parent or one of its affiliates to an
account designated by the Stockholder.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (i) any other section of this Article
III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (ii) other sections of
this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, is a savings and loan
holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _HOLA_ "), and is duly registered as such with the Board of
Governors of the 

 



-15-  Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ "). The Company has
the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all
material respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_
" means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, including, in the case of the
Company, the Company Bank ( _provided_ , that, with respect to this clause
(i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A)
changes after the date hereof in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements or
interpretations thereof, (B) changes after the date hereof in Laws or agency
requirements of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes after the date hereof in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to
such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the execution of
this Agreement or public disclosure or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any effect on a partys relationships with its
customers or employees) ( _provided_ , that the exception in this clause (D)
shall not apply for purposes of the representations and warranties in Sections
3.3(b) or 5.3(b)), (E) actions or omissions expressly required by this
Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions
or omissions taken with the written consent of Parent, in the case of the
Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent, (F) a decline in the trading
price of a partys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet
earnings projections or internal or published financial forecasts or other
estimates, predictions or projections ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the
underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred) or (G) the
expenses incurred by the Company or Parent in negotiating, documenting,
effecting and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B) or (C), to the extent that the
effects of such change are disproportionately adverse to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition
of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
comparable companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to the Company and Parent, shall have
the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10(a)(1)(G) of the HOLA. True and
complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "
_Company Certificate_ ") and the By-laws of the Company (the " _Company By-
laws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
made available by the Company to Parent.

 



-16- (b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate
(or similar) power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted in all material respects. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the Company that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in
Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the

knowledge, threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the
date hereof.

such securities. Except for the First Amended and Restated Stockholder
Agreement, dated December 31, 2012, as amended through the date hereof (the "
_Existing Stockholder Agreement_ "), by and among the Company and the
stockholders listed therein, and the Voting Trust Agreement, there are no
voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a

equity security of such Company Subsidiary or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of such Company Subsidiary. Other than the Company
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any material
equity or ownership interest in any person. The Company Bank does not own any
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except, in the case of clause (y) above, for such violations,

3.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, complete and correct copies of (i)
the consolidated audited balance sheet and statements of income, comprehensive

and schedules thereto and the signed, unqualified opinion of Deloitte and
Touche LLP, its independent auditor) for the fiscal years ended September 30,
2013, 2014 and 2015, in each case for the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis and for the Company Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, and (ii) the

operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated

and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of preparation, in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements, and (iv) have

Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute,

those liabilities (i) that are reflected or reserved against on the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company for the fiscal quarter ended June

its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or
in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have a system of internal controls over financial
reporting that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and (ii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or written claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee
of or attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty

or employees to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof or to the knowledge of the Company, to any director or officer of the
Company.

 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Goldman, Sachs and
Co., neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or
finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent true
and complete copies of all contracts, agreements and arrangements with respect
to the engagement by the Company of Goldman, Sachs and Co. related to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the

(b) Except as set forth in Sections 3.8, 6.1 and 6.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (in the case of Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule,

 



-21-  solely to the extent the applicable action occurs following the date hereof)
and in connection with matters related to this Agreement and the Companys
review of its strategic alternatives, since June 30, 2016, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive
officers or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, are (i)
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or are
reasonably likely to result in a material restriction on the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries businesses or (ii) reasonably likely to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the Companys ability to perform its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to Parent or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

into account any applicable extensions of time to file) all material Tax
Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,
correct, and complete in all material respects, and has paid in full all Taxes
due and payable (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns). Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required
to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, stockholder, independent contractor or other third party.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or

of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company and its

copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain
recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the last six (6) years. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than
such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among the Company and
its Subsidiaries). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has
been a member of an affiliated group filing a

of which was the Company) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise
as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_

Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning

(and where relevant, corresponding provisions of applicable state and local
law) (" _S Corporation_ ") for U.S. federal and applicable state income Tax
purposes, and no election has been made to treat the Company as other than an
S Corporation for U.S. federal or applicable state income Tax purposes. Each
Subsidiary of the Company (other than Subsidiaries that are limited liability
companies disregarded as separate from the Company for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes) is, and has been at all times since its respective formation, a
validly electing "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code. The Company is not and will not be liable

avoidance of doubt, as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election).

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which there is or may be any
liability or obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (either
direct or indirect) or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, excluding, in each case, any Multiemployer Plan.

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent, to the extent

Plan (or descriptions thereof, in the case of any such Company Benefit Plan
that is unwritten), including any amendments thereto and all related trust

all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder, in each case that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, is, in all material respects, in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (the " _Company Qualified Plan_ ") and the related trust, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances and no events
have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any Company Qualified Plan or the related trust.

 



-24- (e) No Company Benefit Plan is (i) subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section

or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, and, in the six (6) years
prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has sponsored,

foregoing types of plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_

Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document for any period through
the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
accrued and reflected on the books and records of the Company in accordance
with normal accounting practices, except as, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(h) There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted and to the knowledge of the
Company, no set of circumstances exist which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim, lawsuit or arbitration, by or on behalf of or against
any of the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Company Benefit Plans, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Benefit Plans, or the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
third party Company Benefit Plan administrator, service provider or fiduciary,
has, within the past three (3) years, engaged in any nonexempt prohibited
transactions under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan reasonably likely to result in liability to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any person the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or
set aside any assets to fund any benefits

 



-25-  under any Company Benefit Plan, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result
in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company
Benefit Plan or related trust.

 

(j) Without limiting the generality of Section 3.11(i), no amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or

any corresponding provisions of state or local Law relating to Tax).

(k) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges

Merger Sub to the Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (x) no such item is required to be set forth

result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (y) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent

 



-41-  Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission by Parent that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (z) any disclosures made
with respect to a section of this Article V shall be deemed to qualify (i) any
other section of this Article V specifically referenced or cross-referenced
and (ii) other sections of this Article V to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to
such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Parent Reports filed by Parent
after January 1, 2015 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding any and
all exhibits and risk factor disclosures contained under the heading

authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent
and the Amended and Restated By-laws of Parent (the " _Parent By-laws_ "), as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by Parent to the Company.

organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of

recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (iii) has all requisite corporate (or
similar) power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to

instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such violations,

5.5 _Reports_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished, as
applicable, all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file or furnish, as applicable, since January 1, 2014 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be
filed or furnished, as applicable, pursuant to the Laws of the United States,
any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where
the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such
fees and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except for
examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has
initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent,
investigation into the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2014 and (ii) there is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), which would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2014 by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (together with
those forms, reports and other documents filed by Parent with the
SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, if any, the " _Parent Reports_
") has been made publicly available. No such Parent Report as of the date
thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made,

 



-45-  not misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later
date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Parent
Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive
officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with
respect to any of the Parent Reports.

5.6 _Financial Statements_.

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders
equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records
of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP. Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned
(or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities
(i) that are reflected or reserved against on the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the audited consolidated balance sheet
of Parent included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2015, in each case, as set forth in the Parent Financial
Statements (including any notes thereto), (ii) incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016, (iii) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
(iv) arising in the ordinary course under any Parent Contract except to the
extent arising from Parents or its applicable Subsidiarys breach of any
such Parent Contract.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any

 



-46-  electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that
would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Parent,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) to the
knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal
controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no
reason to believe that Parents outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
written claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no employee of or attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors or employees to the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee
thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer of Parent.

Capital Inc., Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc. and BlackRock Financial
Management, Inc., neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of their

contemplated by this Agreement.

are no pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their current or former directors or executive officers or challenging the
validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that,
individually or in the aggregate, are (i) material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or are reasonably likely to result in a
material restriction on Parents or any of its Subsidiaries businesses or
(ii) reasonably likely to prevent, materially impede or materially delay
Parents ability to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of

material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

5.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed (taking into account applicable extensions of time to file) all
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are
true, correct, and complete in all material respects, and paid in full all
Taxes due and payable (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns). Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder, independent contractor or other
third party. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax
that remains in effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection
with any material amount of Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or

its Subsidiaries. Parent has made available to the Company true and complete
copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain
recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in the last six (6) years. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation
or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among Parent and its Subsidiaries).
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was Parent) or (B) has any liability for the
Taxes of any person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law), as a 

 



-48-  transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part
of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing

necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership

(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of
obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor
the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, and, to the knowledge of the Parent, no suspension or cancellation of
any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened.

registration, license or qualification is in full force and effect, except for
any non-compliance as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a

dealer under Section 15, Section 15B or Section 15C of the Exchange Act or
which would be the basis for any limitation on serving in any of the
capacities specified in Section 9(a) or 9(b) of the Investment Company Act.
There is no investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its "associated persons,"

and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of any
applicable Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance
with their terms (except as may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).

Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

 

5.16 _Related Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in Section 5.16 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no transactions or series of related
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are there any
currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions, between

former director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5%

Subsidiaries that is included in any document filed with any Regulatory Agency
in connection herewith will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

term is defined by Rule 501 of the Securities Act). Without limiting any of
the foregoing, Parent has not taken, and will not take, any action that would
otherwise cause the Surviving Corporation Shares to be subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Corporation Shares are being offered and sold to Parent in reliance on
specific exemptions from the registration requirements of United States
federal and state securities Laws and regulations and that the Company

compliance with, the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments
and understandings of Parent set forth herein in order to determine the
availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of Parent to acquire the
Surviving Corporation Shares.

5.23 _No Governmental Review_. Parent understands that no United States
federal or state agency or any other Governmental Entity has passed on or made
any recommendation or endorsement of the Surviving Corporation Shares or the
fairness or suitability of the investment in such share nor have such

and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive business or other
proprietary or confidential information provided to the other under this
Section 7.1 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the 

 



-61-  information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient party and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the receiving party unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the
Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. The parties
acknowledge and agree that no provision of this Section 7.1 shall be deemed
to require any party to provide confidential supervisory information to any
other party.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the
provisions of paragraph (a) above, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to require Parent, the Company or the Stockholder (or permit the
Company or the Stockholder, without Parents written consent) to take any
action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction
(including any new obligation, commitment or undertaking to implement
or complete remedial or other compliance actions relating to the Company, the
Company Bank or their businesses or operations) that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (disregarding clause (E) of the
definition thereof) on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger and assuming Parent also acquires the Company Bank
as a result of the Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_
").

 

(c) The parties shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information
concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of any party or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than information containing
competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information or
confidential supervisory information or that is not permitted to be disclosed
under applicable Law.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations, clearances, consents,
orders or approvals from (i) FINRA, (ii) pursuant to the HSR Act, and (iii)
any other regulatory authority whose consent is required under applicable Law
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Parent shall act in good faith and use reasonable best efforts
to facilitate and cooperate with Parent Bank in obtaining the necessary
regulatory approvals contemplated by the Bank Merger Agreement, and otherwise
cooperate in facilitating the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the
Bank Merger under the Bank Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable.

 



-62- 7.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws, including those applicable to confidential supervisory
information, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and other Representatives of
the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems, databases, and
records, including providing reasonable access to a mutually agreed upon
information security assessment (the scope of which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and Parent Bank) conducted by the Company or a third
party consultant (and to the extent any issues are identified by such
assessment, the parties shall cooperate to develop a mutually acceptable
remediation plan), and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing
to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems
and business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents that Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such party may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other partys regular
business operations during any such access. Neither Parent nor the Company nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties), involve any environmental sampling or invasive testing,
or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of the parties shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf
of the other party or any of such other partys Subsidiaries or
Representatives pursuant to Section 7.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated July 21, 2016, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Initial Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the letter agreement, dated as of
September 28, 2016, between Parent and the Company (together with the Initial
Confidentiality Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ ").

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give any

 



-63-  party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 

7.3 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 7.1 of
this Agreement, each of the parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as promptly as practicable
(a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable
to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with any other party to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by the
parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.4 _Registration Rights Agreement; Parent Stockholder Agreement; Escrow
Agreement_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Stockholder shall
enter into (a) a registration rights agreement (the " _Registration Rights
Agreement_ "), which shall become effective at the Effective Time, and which
shall be substantially in the form set forth in Section 7.4(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (b) a stockholder agreement (the " _Parent Stockholder
Agreement_ "), which shall become effective at the Effective Time, and which
shall be substantially in the form set forth in Section 7.4(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (c) the Escrow Agreement, which shall become effective
at the Effective Time.

 

7.5 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Generally_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the
employees of the Company Bank (it being understood and agreed that prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that
the employment of employees of the Company Bank (and any Company Benefit Plans
related to such employees) is transferred to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (other than the Company Bank)) who continues to be employed by
Parent or its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time for so
long as such employee is employed following the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or base
wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or
base wage rate, as applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an
annual short-term cash incentive opportunity that is no less favorable than
the annual short-term cash incentive opportunity provided by the Company or
any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) long-term incentive opportunities on the same basis as
long-term incentive opportunities that are provided by Parent to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (with

 



-64-  respect to a Continuing Employee who is an AR Award holder, subject to such
employee agreeing to waive the right to accruals of annual appreciation
amounts under the AR Awards), and (iv) employee benefits (excluding severance
and any change of control benefits) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the employee benefits provided by the Company or any such
Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee
whose employment is terminated by Parent or its Subsidiaries during
the Continuation Period with severance benefits equal to the severance
benefits for which such Continuing Employee would be eligible to receive under
the severance plans of the Company listed in Section 7.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, determined (1) without taking into account any reduction
after the Closing in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee and (2)
taking into account each Continuing Employees service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the Closing,
Parent and its Subsidiaries, which severance shall be conditioned on such
Continuing Employee timely executing and not revoking a release in favor of
the Parent and its affiliates as contemplated under the applicable Company
severance plan.

(b) _Service Credit_. With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent
or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall
or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each
such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time
under a Company Benefit Plan that is a group medical, dental and vision plan
(to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and
(iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing service recognition
shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension or the employer premium subsidy under, or
eligibility to participate in, any retiree medical plan, or (C) to any benefit
plan that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered
employee population or that is a newly adopted plan or for awards for which
past service is not granted to participants generally.

 

(c) _Change of Control_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms. Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of and as specified in the Company Benefit Plans
will occur at the Effective Time.

 

(d) _401(k)_ _Plan_. If requested by Parent in writing at least twenty (20)
business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k)
plan sponsored

 



-65-  or maintained by the Company (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be
terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent
requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees
of the Company shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective
Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Parent and the Company shall take
any and all actions as may be required as of the date hereof or at any time
from the date hereof to the Effective Time, including amendments to any
Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing
Employees of the Company who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions in the form of cash and notes (in the case of loans) to the
Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning
of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from a Company 401(k) Plan. The Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of any such resolutions or amendments prior
their adoption and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment.

(e) _Reservation of Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement (i) is intended to
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, with respect
to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that
may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under
any benefit plan which Parent or the Company may maintain; (ii) shall be
treated as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any plan maintained
by Parent or the Company; (iii) shall obligate Parent to maintain any
particular benefit plan or arrangement or (iv) shall prevent Parent from
amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement.

 

7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each director or
officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or at any
time from the date hereof to the Effective Time (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer
of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the consideration and approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent
shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, in the defense of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

 



-66- (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , that
Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the Company Indemnified Parties arising from facts or events
which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in Parents good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with but
only upon the consent of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a six- (6)-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium
Cap. If the Company purchases such a "tail policy," Parent shall maintain such
"tail policy" in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Company under this Section 7.6 shall
not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to
the benefit of this Section 7.6 without the prior written consent of the
affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any
other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6 are not
otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation
of Law or otherwise, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.6.

7.7 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other
party, at the expense of the party who makes any such request.

 



-67- 7.8 _Advice of Changes_. Parent shall promptly advise the Company, and each of
the Stockholder and the Company (each party, in such capacity, the "
_Notifying Party_ ") shall promptly advise Parent, of any change or event (a)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on, (i)
if Parent or the Company is the Notifying Party, the Notifying Party and,
(ii) if the Stockholder is the Notifying Party, the Company, or (b) which the
Notifying Party believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of the Notifying Partys representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein that reasonably could be expected to
give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in
set forth in, if Parent is the Notifying Party, Sections 8.1 or 8.3, or if
the Stockholder or the Company is the Notifying Party, Sections 8.1 or 8.2;
_provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 7.8 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2 or
8.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section
8.2 or 8.3 to be satisfied.

 

7.9 _Corporate Governance_. At or prior to the first meeting of the Board of
Directors of Parent following the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Parent shall appoint Rodger O. Riney to the Board of Directors of Parent. If
Rodger O. Riney shall, at such time, be unable to serve as a member of the
Board of Directors of Parent as a result of death, illness or similar
incapacity, the Board of Directors of Parent shall appoint a person
designated by the Stockholder in the manner set forth in the Parent
Stockholder Agreement.

 

7.10 _Acquisition Proposals_. Each of the Stockholder and the Company agrees
that it will not, and the Company will cause its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, agents,
advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate
in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have
or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of the
Company, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 7.10. Each of the Company and the Stockholder will, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of the Company and the Stockholder
will promptly (within two (2) business days) advise Parent following receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the material
terms and conditions of and the identity of the party making such Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this
Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, any

 



-68-  offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the
Company, or (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business
combination involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated
assets of the Company, except, in each case, any sale of whole loans
and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and any _bona fide_
internal reorganization.

7.11 _Public Announcements_. The parties shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan,
and except in respect of any announcement required by applicable Law, a
request by a Governmental Entity or an obligation pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, the Company and
Parent agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of
the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent
practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.12 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

7.13 _Company Debt_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions to facilitate (i) the termination at the
Closing of all commitments in respect of (x) the Fourth Amended and Restated
Loan Agreement between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as
administrative agent, and the other parties thereto, dated as of February 22,
2013, as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified (the "
_Existing Credit Facility_ "), (y) the Brokerage Credit Agreement (Secured
Customer Facility A) between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association,
dated as of February 28, 2011, as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise
modified (the " _Existing U.S. Bank Uncommitted Line_ ") and (z) the
Uncommitted Revolving Loan Agreement between the Company and Fifth Third
Bank, dated as of November 18, 2009, as amended,

 



-69-  supplemented, restated or otherwise modified (together with the Existing
Credit Facility and the Existing U.S. Bank Uncommitted Line, the " _Existing
Indebtedness_ "), (ii) the repayment in full on the Closing Date of all
obligations with respect to the Existing Indebtedness and (iii) the release on
the Closing Date of any Liens securing such Existing Indebtedness and
guarantees, if any, in connection therewith. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent at least two (2) business days
prior to the Closing Date executed payoff letters with respect to
the Existing Indebtedness (the " _Payoff Letters_ ") in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf
of the persons to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letters
together with any related release documentation shall, among other things,
include the payoff amount and provide that Liens and guarantees granted in
connection with the Existing Indebtedness relating to the assets, rights and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness,
shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the applicable Payoff
Letters at or prior to the Closing, be released and terminated.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to seek to facilitate the continued effectiveness of
the Promissory Note owed by the Company to The Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance Company, dated as of February 10, 2004 and the Loan Documents
related thereto (collectively, the " _NML Promissory Note_ "), following the
Closing without any default, event of default, mandatory repayment obligation,
or other similar right of any lender thereunder or holder thereof having then
occurred or being continuing (including as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), or, at Parents written request, the
repayment at Closing of all amounts due under the NML Promissory Note and the
termination of the Loan Documents related thereto, and (ii)
promptly following the receipt of a written request from Parent, deliver all
notices and take all actions to facilitate the redemption, defeasance,
amendment (including by consent solicitation), satisfaction and discharge
and/or other action with respect to the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 issued
by the Company pursuant to the Indenture dated as of July 11, 2011 between the
Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.; _provided_ , that
no such action shall be required to be taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unless the effect of such action will not be effective in the
absence of a Closing. In connection with any of the foregoing, the Company
shall coordinate and consult with Parent with respect to all communications
with its lenders and creditors and documentation to effectuate the foregoing.
Parent shall cooperate in good faith with the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the foregoing, including (in the event Parent does not
request the repayment at Closing of all amounts due under the NML Promissory
Note as described above) by causing Parent or one of its Subsidiaries to be
substituted, as of the Closing, for the Trust and Rodger O. Riney (the "
_Existing Guarantors_ ") as guarantor of the NML Promissory Note pursuant to
the Guarantee of Recourse Obligations, dated February 10, 2004, made by Rodger
O. Riney and the Trust in favor of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Company (the " _Guarantee_ ") (it being agreed that neither party shall be
required to pay any unreasonable fee related thereto); _provided_ , that in
the event that Parent or one of its Subsidiaries is not substituted for the
Existing Guarantors as guarantor of the NML Promissory Note under the
Guarantee, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Existing Guarantors for any and
all payments made at any time after the Closing in connection with their
obligations under the Guarantee. 

 



-70- 7.14 _Restrictive Shares and Legends_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Stockholder
covenants that the Consideration Shares may be disposed of only pursuant to
an effective registration statement under, and in compliance with the
requirements of, the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable state, federal or
foreign securities Laws. The Stockholder agrees that all certificates or other
instruments representing the Consideration Shares subject to this Agreement
will bear a legend (the " _Private Placement Legend_ ") substantially to the
following effect and that appropriate no transfer restrictions may be issued
to Parents transfer agent:

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND
MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT WHILE A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT AND
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS.

(b) Upon request of the Stockholder, if at any time the restrictions on
transfer under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws are no
longer applicable, upon receipt by Parent of an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent to the effect that the Private Placement Legend is no
longer required under the Securities Act or applicable state Laws, Parent
shall promptly cause the Private Placement Legend to be removed from any
certificate for any shares of Parent Common Stock to be so transferred.

all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date, and
shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes reflected as due on such Tax
Returns. The Tax Returns prepared and filed by the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.15(a)(i) shall be prepared consistently with the past practice of

Returns relating to a taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Tax Period_ ")

 



-71-  required to be filed after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Returns shall be
prepared consistently with Past Practice, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Stockholder shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes
reflected as due on such Tax Returns. Parent, the Company, and the Companys
Subsidiaries shall grant, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause their
respective affiliates to grant, one or more powers of attorney deemed
reasonably necessary or appropriate by the Stockholder in connection with the
filing of any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(iii) Subject to Section 7.15(a)(v), Parent shall file or cause to be filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax
Returns that relate to a taxable period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (for the avoidance of doubt, other than in respect of the Company
Bank) beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (such a
taxable period, a " _Straddle Period_ "). Any such Tax Returns shall be
prepared consistently with Past Practice, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. Parent shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes reflected
as due on such Tax Returns; _provided_ , that the Stockholder shall pay
Parent or cause Parent to be paid the amount of Taxes reflected as due on such
Tax Returns that are allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date no later than five (5) days prior to the due
date of such Taxes.

(iv) Parent shall file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(v) In the case of Tax Returns described in Sections
7.15(a)(ii)-7.15(a)(iii), the party preparing such Tax Returns (the "
_Preparing Party_ ") shall provide drafts of each such Tax Return to the other
party (the " _Non-Preparing Party_ ") for review and comment at least thirty
(30) days prior to the Tax Return being filed (except where such thirty (30)
day period is not practical, in which case as soon as practical). Within ten
(10) days of receiving a draft of such Tax Return (except where such ten (10)
day period is not practical, in which case as soon as practical), the Non-
Preparing Party may provide written comments to the Preparing Party within ten
(10) days of receipt of such Tax Return. The parties shall attempt to resolve
any dispute through direct good-faith negotiation; however, if the parties
cannot reach agreement within ten (10) business days after the date such
written comments are provided, (A) the dispute shall be referred for
resolution to an Accounting Firm described in Section 7.15(g)(iii), (B) the
parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
issue within thirty (30) days after its selection a written report stating its
resolution of the dispute and, in issuing such report, the Accounting Firm
shall be instructed to consider only those items or amounts with regard to the
Tax Return as to which the Non-Preparing Party has disagreed in its written
comments, (C) upon the Accounting Firm issuing its written report, the Tax
Return shall be final and binding on the parties, and (D) the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Preparing Party,
on the one hand, and the Non-Preparing Party, on the other hand. In the event
that the Accounting Firm has not resolved any such dispute prior to the
deadline for filing such Tax Return (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) the Preparing Party shall be entitled to file such Tax
Return (or amendment) as prepared by it subject to amendment to reflect the
resolution when rendered by the Accounting Firm.

 



-72- (vi) To the extent inconsistent, (A) Section 7.15(g), and not this Section
7.15(a), shall govern the preparation and filing of the Section 338 Forms, and
(B) Section 7.15(d), and not this Section 7.15(a), shall govern the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes arising from
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) _Apportionment_. In any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be:

(i) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes or Taxes determined on an arrears basis) and franchise
Taxes (except franchise Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts),
the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the total number of calendar days in the Straddle Period; and

(ii) In the case of other Taxes (such as Taxes that are based on wage
payments, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, Taxes
based upon occupancy and Taxes imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)
other than the Transfer Taxes that are the subject of Section 7.15(d)), the
amount of any such Taxes shall be determined by closing the books as if such
taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Amendments_. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall, or shall
cause or permit the Company to, amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant
an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part for the Company with respect to any taxable
period ending on or before, or including, the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of the Stockholder (not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed).

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall, at its own expense, file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any transfer,
documentary, stamp or other related Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") that are
required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder, on the other hand,
shall each be responsible for and shall pay fifty (50) percent of all such
Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable law, the Stockholder shall, and
shall cause its affiliates to join, in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.

 

(e) _Contests_. This Section 7.15(e), and not Section 10.4 shall govern Tax
Claims.

 

(i) If Parent or any controlled affiliate of Parent is notified that a claim
shall be made against Parent, the Stockholder, any Certificate Holder, or any

 



-73-  S Corporation Shareholder, the Company, or any of their affiliates, by any
Governmental Entity, which, if successful, could be reasonably expected to (A)
increase the Tax liability of the Stockholder, any Certificate Holder, or any
S Corporation Shareholder or (B) result in an indemnity payment under Section
10.2 relating to a breach or inaccuracy of any representation made in Section
3.10 or relating to a breach of a covenant or agreement contained in Section
6.2(p) or this Article VII (any such claim, a " _Tax Claim_ "), then Parent
shall promptly notify the Stockholder in writing of such Tax Claim stating the
nature and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof; _provided_ , that
the failure to timely notify the Stockholder shall not relieve the Stockholder
of any liability pursuant to Section 10.2 except to the extent that the
Stockholder is prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.

(ii) With respect to any audit, assessment, or administrative or court
proceeding or similar proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") that relates to a
Tax Claim solely with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, the Stockholder shall have the right to control
all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding (including
selection of counsel); _provided_ , that (A) Parent shall be entitled to
participate at its own expense in any such Tax Proceeding, (B) the Stockholder
shall cooperate with Parent in the defense of any such Tax Proceeding and (C)
the Stockholder shall obtain the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) prior to the settlement of any
Tax Proceeding that could reasonably be expected to increase the tax
liability of Parent or, for any taxable period other than a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. Parent, the Company, and
the Companys Subsidiaries shall grant, and shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause their respective affiliates to grant, one or more powers of
attorney deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate by the Stockholder in
connection with any Tax Proceeding subject to this Section 7.15(e)(ii).
The Stockholder shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes resulting from
settlement of such Tax Claim.

(iii) With respect to any Tax Proceeding that is not the subject of Section
7.15(e)(ii) and that relates either to a Tax Claim or to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent
shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding
(including selection of counsel); _provided_ , that (i) Stockholder shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in any such Tax Proceeding, (ii)
Parent will cooperate with Stockholder in the defense of any such Tax
Proceeding and (iii) Parent shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Stockholder (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) prior to
the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding. Parent shall remit or cause to be
remitted any Taxes resulting from settlement of such Tax Claim; _provided_ ,
that the Stockholder shall pay Parent or cause Parent to be paid the amount of
Taxes resulting from settlement of such Tax Claim that are allocable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date.

(iv) Parent shall control all Tax Proceedings that are not described in
Section 7.15(e)(ii)-(iii).

 



-74- (f) _Cooperation_. After the Closing, the parties to this Agreement
shall cooperate, and shall cause their affiliates to cooperate, fully in
preparing for and conducting any audits of, or disputes with Tax authorities
regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall
provide such information as reasonably necessary for such audits, disputes or
for the filing of all Tax Returns. The parties shall retain for the full
period of any statute of limitations, and upon reasonable request will provide
the other party with, any records or information which may be relevant to
such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination.

(g)  _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(i) Parent and Stockholder shall join in making an election under
Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election under state or local
Law) with respect to the Merger (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ").

 

(ii) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall furnish
Stockholder with Parents determination of the ADSP (as defined in applicable
Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) and the allocation of ADSP
among the assets of the Company and other relevant items (the " _Proposed
Allocation_ "). Within sixty (60) days of receiving the Proposed Allocation,
Stockholder will notify Parent of any dispute with respect to the Proposed
Allocation (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), specifying the items or amounts with
respect to which Stockholder disagrees, Stockholders calculation of such
items and amounts and in reasonable detail Stockholders grounds for such
disagreement; _provided_ , that if Stockholder does not notify Parent by a
Dispute Notice within the sixty (60) day period for providing such notice, or
if Stockholder notifies Parent in writing that it agrees with the Proposed
Allocation, then the Proposed Allocation shall be final and binding (which
Proposed Allocation, when final and binding, shall become the " _Final
Allocation_ "). Parent shall bear the costs and expenses of preparing the
Proposed Allocation.

 

(iii) Parent and Stockholder each agree to consult in good faith with regard
to the Proposed Allocation; however, if Parent and Stockholder cannot reach
agreement within ten (10) business days after the date of any Dispute Notice
pursuant to Section 7.15(g)(ii), then (A) the dispute shall be referred for
resolution to an accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") with no material relationships with any of the parties or
their respective affiliates chosen by agreement of Parent and Stockholder, (B)
Parent and Stockholder shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to issue within thirty (30) days after its selection a written
report stating its resolution of the dispute and, in issuing such report, the
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to consider only those items or amounts
with regard to the Proposed Allocation as to which Stockholder has disagreed
in the Dispute Notice, (C) upon the Accounting Firm issuing its written
report, the Proposed Allocation shall be final and binding as a
Final Allocation, and (D) the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne equally by Stockholder, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand.

 



-75- (iv) To the extent that any adjustments are made to the purchase price paid

the Section 338 Forms shall be revised to reflect all reasonable comments
provided to Parent by Stockholder within thirty (30) days of Stockholders
receipt of the draft Section 338 Forms. The Section 338 Forms shall be duly
executed (to the extent required to make valid the Section 338(h)(10)
Election) by the Stockholder, the Certificate Holders and/or an authorized
officer of Parent and/or the Company, as applicable. Parent shall bear the
costs and expenses of preparing the Section 338 Forms.

 

(vi) The parties agree that they shall not take, and shall use reasonable
efforts to cause their affiliates not to take, in any Tax Return or audit or
any proceeding before any Governmental Entity, any position inconsistent with
the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including the Final Allocation, unless and to
the extent required to do so pursuant to a final determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar applicable state or local Law).

(h) _Tax Distributions_. The parties agree that dividends required by section
12(b) of the Existing Stockholder Agreement with respect to taxable income of
the Company on or before the Closing Date, but that are not required by the
Existing Stockholder Agreement to be made until after the Closing, may be
made at or prior to the Closing on the basis of reasonable estimates;
_provided_ , that, following the Closing, the parties agree to cooperate in
good faith to determine the actual amounts of dividends required by section
12(b) of the Existing Stockholder Agreement, and the parties further agree (i)
in the case that the estimated required dividend is more than the actual
required dividend as determined by the parties, to cause the excess to be
repaid by the Stockholder to the Company and (ii) in the case that the actual
required dividend as determined by the parties is more than the estimated
required dividend, to cause the excess to be paid by the Company to
the Stockholder.

7.16 _Transaction Expenses_. The Company shall be responsible for and shall
pay at or prior to the Closing all costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in connection with this

Goldman, Sachs and Co. or any other outside counsel, accountants, financial
advisors, consultants, investment bankers, brokers or other advisors
(collectively, but excluding all costs, fees and expenses payable to
the Independent Valuation Firm, " _Transaction Expenses_ "). The Company
shall provide to Parent a true and correct list accounting for all Transaction
Expenses (whether incurred or to be incurred) at least five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the costs and expenses
with respect to the services provided by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement shall not be deemed Transaction Expenses.

 



-76- 7.17 _Audit Assistance_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

sheets and statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other

end of the most recent quarterly period that has ended at least forty (40)
days prior to the Closing Date, and for the corresponding period of the prior
fiscal year, in each case meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act and all other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by
Parent relating to the Merger; _provided_ , that no officer of the Company
shall be required to provide the certifications required by Rule 13a-14(a) or

7.18 _Client Consents_. 

(a) No later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof, Parent and the
Company shall agree to a form of notice that the Company shall cause the
Company Investment Advisor Subsidiary to send, substantially in the form
thereof, to each Client, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement. Parent and the Company agree that the consent by
a Client to the assignment or deemed assignment resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed given for any and all
purposes under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the
relevant Investment Advisory Contract, as a result of the applicable notice
described in the preceding sentence so long as (i) negative consent is not
expressly prohibited by the Investment Advisory Contract (for purposes of this
Agreement, it is assumed that, unless an agreement expressly requires written
consent to an "assignment" as defined under the Advisers Act or a change in
control, then such "negative consent" or "silence" is permissible hereunder
and thereunder) and (ii) sixty (60) days elapse from the date the notice is
sent to such Client at an address such Client has advised notices in respect
of its account may be directed, during which period such Client continues to
have its account managed by the Company Investment Advisor Subsidiary and
does not notify the Company Investment Advisor Subsidiary that it is
withholding its consent (but then only to the extent that such Client has a
contractual or statutory right to withhold its consent) and such Client shall
not have otherwise provided a notice of termination of the relevant Investment
Advisory Contract that provides for the termination to be effective as of the
Closing Date or as of the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date,
but contingent upon the Closing. Parent agrees that the consent process set
forth in this Section 7.18(a) shall be the only consent required from any
counterparty to an Investment Advisory Contract in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby for any and all purposes
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
adequacy thereof).

 



-77- (b) As used herein:

 

(i) " _Client_ " means any person to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary provides investment management or investment advisory services,
including any sub-advisory services, pursuant to an Investment Advisory
Contract.

the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the purpose of providing investment

advisory or investment management services.

 

7.19 _Broadridge Conversion_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
implement and complete its planned conversion of the Companys technology and
back office platforms, and those of the Company Subsidiaries, from a
proprietary system to a system run by Broadridge Securities Processing
Solutions, Inc. pursuant to the Broadridge Agreements (as such term is defined
in the Company Disclosure Schedule), including, subject to the last sentence
of this Section 7.19, to comply with relevant settlement rules that, upon
their effectiveness, will require broker-dealers to shorten the settlement
cycle from trade date plus three business days (T+3) to trade date plus two
business days (T+2) for U.S. secondary market transactions in equities,
corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts and financial
instruments composed of these products (the " _Broadridge Conversion_ "). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to implement and complete the
Broadridge Conversion as soon as practicable after the date hereof and prior
to March 1, 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company agree
to work together in good faith, from the date hereof until no later than
November 18, 2016, to explore mutually agreeable alternatives to the
Broadridge Conversion in order for the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply
with such relevant settlement rules that, upon their effectiveness, will
require broker-dealers to shorten the settlement cycle from trade date plus
three business days (T+3) to trade date plus two business days (T+2) for U.S.
secondary market transactions in equities, corporate and municipal bonds,
unit investment trusts and financial instruments composed of these products);
_provided_ , that the Company shall not take any affirmative action to
implement or implement any such alternative without the prior approval of
Parent.

7.20 _IDA Amendment_. From and after the date hereof, in connection with that
certain Amendment No. 1 to the Insured Deposit Account Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof, by and among The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Parent Bank, Parent
and their respective affiliates party thereto (the " _IDA Amendment_ "), the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to take such actions as Parent
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the participation following the
Closing by the Company and its customers in the sweep program provided for in
such existing Insured Deposit Account Agreement and the treatment of the
Companys brokerage accounts following the Closing in accordance

 



-78-  therewith pursuant to the IDA Amendment, including cooperating with Parent
to, and using commercially reasonable efforts to take actions prior to the
Closing that would, as of the Closing (i) effect any changes to the Companys
existing sweep agreements with other depository institutions that are
necessary to effect the foregoing, (which changes shall be effective as of the
Closing and provided that no such action by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to be taken by the Company or ay of its
Subsidiaries unless the effect of such action will not be effective in the
absence of a Closing) and (ii) effect any changes to, and take any
actions required by, the accounts of customers of the Company opened prior to
the Closing, any omnibus money market direct deposit accounts representing
individual money market deposit accounts of the Companys customers, and any
applicable customer agreements of the Company, in each case as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing as of the Closing (including by posting
notices of changes and providing notices and opt-out rights to the Companys
customers prior to the Closing to the extent required by Law and the terms of
such customer account agreements), subject to compliance with applicable Law.
Nothing in this Section 7.20 shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to violate or breach any Contract.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

9.1  _Termination_.

(a) This Agreement shall automatically terminate if the Bank Merger Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the completion of the
Bank Merger. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time:

 

(i) by mutual consent of Parent, Parent Bank and the Stockholder in a written
instrument;

 

(ii) by either Parent or the Stockholder if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval under
the Bank Merger Agreement has denied approval of the Bank Merger, and such
denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order,
injunction or decree or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite
Regulatory Approval or a Requisite Regulatory Approval under the Bank Merger
Agreement, as the case may be, shall be due to the failure of (A) Parent,
Merger Sub or Parent Bank, as applicable, if Parent seeks to terminate this
Agreement, or (B) the Company, the Stockholder or Company Bank, as applicable,
if the Stockholder seeks to terminate this Agreement, to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such failing party set forth herein or in the
Bank Merger Agreement, as applicable;

(iii) by either Parent or the Stockholder if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date
of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of (A) Parent or
Merger Sub, if Parent seeks to terminate this Agreement, or (B) the Company or
the Stockholder, if the Stockholder seeks to terminate this Agreement, to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such failing party set
forth herein; or

(iv) by either Parent or the Stockholder ( _provided_ , that, in the event of
a termination by (A) Parent, neither Parent nor Merger Sub or (B) the
Stockholder, neither the Company nor the Stockholder, is then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement
on the part of the Company or the Stockholder, in the case of a termination
by Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by the
Stockholder, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 8.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Section 8.3, in the
case of a termination by the Stockholder, and which is not cured within
forty-five (45) days following written notice to the Stockholder, in the case
of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the
Stockholder, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period
(or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date).

 



-82- (b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(ii)-(iv) shall give written notice of such termination to the other
party in accordance with Section 11.4, specifying the provision or provisions
hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of
the Stockholder, the Voting Trustee, individually or in such capacity, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that (i) Section 7.2(b), this Section 9.2 and Article XI shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent, the Company nor
the Stockholder shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of each of Parent
and the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock
or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, of the economic benefits of
the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the holders of
Company Common Stock, it being understood that each of the Company and Parent
shall be entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the right
to recover such losses on behalf of its stockholders in its sole and absolute
discretion (and such stockholders may not pursue damages for such losses
directly), and any amounts received by the Company or Parent, as applicable,
in connection therewith may be retained by the Company or Parent, as
applicable).

(b) _Employee Non-solicit_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, for a period of three (3) years from the
date of such termination, neither Parent nor any of its controlled affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any person who is an employee
of the Company or any of its affiliates having a title that is at or above
Manager, or induce, or attempt to induce, any such employee to terminate his
or her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her relationship with, the
Company or their affiliates;  _provided_ , that the foregoing restriction
shall not apply to any such employee who (i) has not been an employee of the
Company or its affiliates for at least one hundred twenty (120) days and whom
neither Parent nor its Representatives, directly or indirectly, solicited
prior to such time, (ii) who was terminated by the Company prior to any
solicitation or (iii) who contacted Parent on his or her own initiative, with
respect to employment by Parent or its affiliates; _provided_ that nothing in
this Section 9.2(b) shall prohibit general solicitations of employment not
specifically directed toward employees of the Company or hiring any person as
a result thereof.

10.2 _Indemnification by the Stockholder_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2 and the limitations set forth in this Section 10.2,
from and after the Effective Time, the Stockholder shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, its affiliates, including Parent Bank (and including the
Company and its Subsidiaries), and their respective directors, officers,

incurred or suffered by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties, whether in
respect of Third Party Claims, claims between any of the parties hereto, or
otherwise, directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company contained in this Agreement, in each case as of the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement;

 



-84- (iii) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by

Closing Date;

 

(iv) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Stockholder contained in

which event the Stockholder shall only pay or be liable for Losses under
Section 10.2(a)(i) and (iii) in excess of the Deductible or (ii) with respect
to any claim under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (iii), unless such claim (taken
together with all other claims, if any, resulting from the same facts and
circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $75,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_
") (nor shall such item be applied to or considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Parent Indemnified Parties Losses for
purposes of Section 10.2(b)(i) or 10.2(c)).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.2
shall be effected first out of the Escrow Account pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.2 and the Escrow Agreement to the extent there is cash or
Indemnity Escrow Shares then in the Escrow Account. The maximum amount for
which the Stockholder shall be liable under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (iii) in the
aggregate at any time shall be, and in respect of any claims under such
Sections the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only have recourse to, the
amount of cash and Indemnity Escrow Shares then in the Escrow Account, in
each case except with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation. Once there is no remaining cash or Indemnity Escrow Shares in
the Escrow Account, the Stockholder shall have no further liability under
Section 10.2(a)(i) or (iii), except with respect to any breach or inaccuracy
of any Fundamental Representation. The maximum amount for which the
Stockholder shall be liable under this Section 10.2 in the aggregate,

including with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation and any breach of any covenant or agreement or pursuant
to 10.2(a)(v), shall not exceed the Brokerage Firm Consideration. Any
indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.2

the

 



-85-  Stockholder contained in this Agreement, except for the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.8(a) and 5.8(a), and any Losses resulting
from or arising out of any such breach or inaccuracy, shall be determined
without reference to and disregarding the words "material," "materially,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or other similar qualifications as to materiality
contained or incorporated, directly or indirectly, in any such representation
or warranty.

(e) The Stockholder shall not have any liability in respect of any Loss to
the extent the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to the claim on
which it is based is addressed by a specific reserve reflected in the Company
Financial Statements.

 

10.3 _Indemnification by Parent_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 10.3, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Certificate
Holders, the Stockholder, their respective affiliates, and their respective
trustees, donors, beneficiaries, directors, officers, managers, stockholders,
employees and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each
in their capacity as such (the " _Stockholder Indemnified Parties_ ", together
with the Parent Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from,
against and in respect of and pay such Stockholder Indemnified Parties the
amount of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, any of
the Stockholder Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of Third Party Claims,
claims between any of the parties hereto, or otherwise, directly or
indirectly resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement, in each case as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date or (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall not have any liability under Section 10.3(a)(i), except with
respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation, (i)
unless the Stockholder Indemnified Parties have suffered Losses under Section
10.3(a)(i) that in the aggregate are in excess of the Deductible in which
event Parent shall only pay or be liable for Losses under Section 10.3(a)(i)
in excess of the Deductible or (ii) with respect to any claim under Section
10.3(a)(i) unless such claim (taken together with all other claims, if any,
resulting from the same facts and circumstances) involves Losses in excess of
the De Minimis Amount (nor shall such item be applied to or considered for
purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties Losses for purposes of Section 10.3(b)(i) or 10.3(c)).

 

(c) The maximum amount for which Parent shall be liable under Section
10.3(a)(i) in the aggregate shall be an amount equal to the product of (A)
0.026 and (B) the Brokerage Firm Consideration, except with respect to any
breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation. The maximum amount for
which Parent shall be liable under this Section 10.3 in the aggregate,
including with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation, shall not exceed the Brokerage Firm Consideration.

 



-86- (d) Parent shall not have any liability in respect of any Loss to the extent
the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to the claim on which it
is based is addressed by a specific reserve reflected in the Parent Financial
Statements.

 

(e) Any indemnification of a Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 10.3 shall be effected within fifteen (15) days after the Final
Determination thereof by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available
funds from Parent to an account designated by the applicable Stockholder
Indemnified Party to Parent.

 

10.4 _Claims_.

 

(a) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification against any
Losses unless it has given to the party from whom indemnification is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written claim notice relating to such Losses
(a " _Claim Notice_ "). Any Claim Notice delivered to the Stockholder by a
Parent Indemnified Party shall also be delivered to the Escrow Agent. The
Claim Notice shall be given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware
of the facts indicating that a claim for indemnification may be warranted and
shall state in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the nature and amount
of the claim. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give a Claim Notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article
X, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
and materially prejudiced by the failure to give such Claim Notice.

(b) If a Claim Notice relates to a claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand
asserted by a person who is not a party (or a successor to a party) to this
Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may, through
counsel of its own choosing and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, by notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days assume the
defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that any
Indemnified Party shall be (i) entitled to participate in any such defense
with counsel of its own choice at its own expense and (ii) shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense with counsel of its own choice at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party if representation of both parties by the
same counsel creates a conflict of interest under applicable standards of
professional conduct. In any event, if the Indemnifying Party fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding
within thirty (30) days after receiving a Claim Notice with respect to the
Third Party Claim or thereafter fails to continue to diligently defend the
action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party may assume such defense, and may
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Third
Party Claim, and the fees and expenses thereof, including of its attorneys,
will be covered by the indemnity provided for in this Article X. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
settle or compromise any pending or threatened Third Party Claim in respect of
which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified
Party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) or consent to
the entry of any judgment (A) which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of
a written release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim,
(B) which includes any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability
or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified

 



-87-  Party or (C) in any manner that involves any injunctive or other equitable
relief against or any payment by the Indemnified Party or that may adversely
affect the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may not compromise or
settle any pending or threatened Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the sole relief granted is
injunctive or equitable relief for which the Indemnifying Party would have no
liability or to which the Indemnifying Party would not be subject.

 

(c) The parties agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim, and the
party that is in control of the defense of such Third Party Claim shall keep
the other parties reasonably informed of the progress and material
developments of such defense. In connection with any Third Party Claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall: (i) preserve all material evidence relevant to the claim; (ii) allow
the Indemnifying Partys Representatives to reasonably investigate, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, the fact, matter, event or circumstance alleged
to give rise to such claim and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of such claim; and (iii) disclose to the Indemnifying Party
and its Representatives all material of which it is aware which relates to
the claim and provide reasonable information and assistance, including access
to premises and personnel, and the right to examine and copy or photograph any
assets, accounts, documents and records, as the Indemnifying Party or its
Representatives may reasonably request, subject to the Indemnifying Party and
its Representatives agreeing in such form as the Indemnified Party may
reasonably require to keep all such information confidential and to use it
only for the purpose of investigating and defending the claim in question.

10.5 _Adjustment of Indemnification Payments_. 

(a) Any indemnity payment made by the Stockholder to a Parent Indemnified
Party, on the one hand, or by Parent to a Stockholder Indemnified Party, on
the other hand, pursuant to this Article X in respect of a Loss shall be net
of an amount equal to (i) any insurance proceeds actually received and any
other amounts actually recovered from third parties (whether by payment,
discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) by the Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim, __less__ (ii) any related costs and expenses of such
receipt or recovery, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any related
insurance claims and any increased premiums associated with such recovery
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the amount of any retention
or deductible under any such insurance claims). If the Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party,
net of expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount
and any increased premiums associated with such recovery (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include the amount of any retention or deductible
under any such insurance claims).

 

(b) Any payment made by the Stockholder to a Parent Indemnified Party

 



-88-  on the one hand, or by Parent to a Stockholder Indemnified Party, on the
other hand, pursuant to this Article X in respect of a Loss shall be (i)
reduced by an amount equal to the income tax benefits, if any, attributable
to such Loss and (ii) increased by an amount equal to the income taxes, if
any, attributable to the receipt of such indemnity payment, but only to the
extent that such tax benefits are actually realized, or such income taxes are
actually paid, as the case may be, by the Parent Indemnified Party or
Stockholder Indemnified Party or any consolidated group of which any Parent
Indemnified Party or Stockholder Indemnified Party is a member.

 

(c) " _Final Determination_ " for purposes of this Agreement shall mean the
earlier to occur of a written agreement by Parent and the Stockholder or a
final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, in either
case determining the amount of Losses required to be paid by Parent to a
Stockholder Indemnified Party or the Stockholder to a Parent Indemnified
Party, as applicable, in respect of a claim hereunder. Any amounts payable
under this Article X shall bear interest from the date the relevant loss or
losses occurred at a per annum rate equal to the federal long-term
rate, determined pursuant to Section 1274(d) of the Code and published by the
IRS for the most recent calendar month ending prior to such day, compounded
semi-annually.

 

10.6 _Duty to Mitigate_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss in respect of which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to recover from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article X upon acquiring actual knowledge of any event which would be
reasonably likely to, or does, give rise to such Loss.

 

10.7 _Effectiveness and Actions_. This Article X shall not be effective until
immediately after the Effective Time. The Stockholder shall have the
exclusive right to take any and all action with respect to this Article X on
behalf of itself and the other Stockholder Indemnified Parties, including with
respect to making claims hereunder. Parent shall have the exclusive right to
take any and all action with respect to this Article X on behalf of itself
and the other Parent Indemnified Parties, including with respect to making
claims hereunder.

 

10.8 _Exclusive Remedy; Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in the absence of fraud or willful misconduct or willful
breach, (a) the parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the
Effective Time, the rights provided in this Article X (but subject to the
limitations set forth herein) shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy for the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties with respect to any Losses suffered in connection with or arising from
(i) any breach or inaccuracy (or alleged breach or inaccuracy) of any
representation or warranty made by the parties contained in this Agreement or
(ii) any breach (or alleged breach) of any covenant or agreement of the
parties contained in this Agreement or any document delivered by the parties
pursuant to this Agreement other than, in the case of both clauses (i) and
(ii), breaches of, or obligations arising out of, Section 1.5, Article II,
Section 7.6, Section 7.9, the last sentence of Section 7.13(b), Section 7.14,
Section 7.15(a), Section 7.15(d) and Section 7.15(e) and for breaches, and
obligations, for which, as applicable, the remedy of specific performance and
other equitable relief is available and (b) the balance then remaining in the
Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive recourse for any and all
payments that may become owing to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to a
claim for indemnification under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (iii) (other than in
respect of the Fundamental Representations) and no such claim by the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be

 



-89-  asserted against, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to indemnification from, the Stockholder, the Voting Trustee, any Certificate
Holder, any of their respective affiliates or any other person for a claim
for indemnification under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (iii) (other than in respect
of the Fundamental Representations) other than by recourse to the Escrow
Account. Any indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to a
claim for indemnification under Section 10.2(a)(i) or 10.2(a)(iii) with
respect to a Fundamental Representation, or under Section 10.2(a)(ii),
10.2(a)(iv) or 10.2(a)(v) shall be effected first out of the Escrow
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2 and the Escrow Agreement to
the extent there is cash or Indemnity Escrow Shares then in the Escrow
Account, and then if there is no cash or Indemnity Escrow Shares then in the
Escrow Account, by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available funds
from the Stockholder to an account designated by Parent. The disposition of
funds in the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms set forth herein
and in the Escrow Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, effective as
of the Effective Time, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action
(including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against
the other parties or any of their respective affiliates arising under or based
upon any Law or otherwise, in each case arising out of any events,
circumstances or actions taken at or prior to the Closing, other than in
respect of any liability expressly retained, assumed, transferred or allocated
to Parent or the Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement including the
indemnification provisions of this Article X. The provisions of this
Agreement shall not limit or affect in any way any parties rights under the
Escrow Agreement, the Parent Stockholder Agreement or the Registration Rights
Agreement.

operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Stockholder may prior to the Effective Time act on behalf of the Company in
any respect with respect to this Agreement.

11.3 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this

-92- 11.5 _Attorney Client Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees to comply with the provisions of this Section 11.5 and,
following the Closing, agrees to cause Parents controlled affiliates and
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
other than the Company Bank) (collectively with Parent, the " _Parent Parties_
") to comply with the provisions of this Section 11.5 and to execute and
deliver any documents or agreements reasonably requested by the Stockholder to
implement such provisions.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any representation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary by Sullivan and Cromwell LLP (" _S andC_") prior to the Closing Date,
each Parent Party:

(i) consents to SandCs representation of the Stockholder, any Certificate
Holder and any Rodger O. Riney Family Member (each, a " _Stockholder Party_ ")
in connection with any matters or disputes arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements, the Escrow Agreement, the Parent
Stockholder Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Support
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, regardless of
any confidential information SandC may learn or acquire with respect to the
foregoing agreements and transactions or otherwise;

(ii) waives any claim it has or may have that SandC has a conflict of interest
or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation based upon
SandCs prior representation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and

 

(iii) agrees that, if a dispute arises between any Stockholder Party, on the
one hand, and any Parent Party, on the other hand, SandC may represent such
Stockholder Party notwithstanding that the interests of such Stockholder Party
and such Parent Party may be directly adverse and that SandC may have
represented the Company in a substantially related matter.

 

(c) As to all communications prior to the Closing that relate in any way to
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements, the Escrow Agreement, the
Parent Stockholder Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Support
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and that are
privileged communications between SandC, on the one hand, and, prior to the
Closing, any Stockholder Party or the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on
the other hand (collectively, " _Confidential Communications_ "), each Parent
Party agrees that the attorney-client privilege belongs, to the extent
such privilege exists, to the applicable Stockholder Party, may be controlled
by such Stockholder Party and will not pass to or be claimed by any Parent
Party. Each Parent Party will not assert that privilege has been waived with
respect to Confidential Communications coming into the possession of such
Parent Party. To the extent that any Parent Party has or maintains any control
of such privilege of such Confidential Communications, such Parent Party will
not, except as may be required by applicable Law, waive or attempt to waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, following the Closing, a
dispute arises between any Parent Party and a third party (other than a
Stockholder Party, but including any Governmental Entity), such Parent Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to

 



-93-  assert the attorney-client privilege against such third party to the extent
necessary to prevent disclosure of Confidential Communications; _provided_
that, any reasonable direct costs incurred by such Parent Party in asserting
such attorney-client privilege shall be reimbursed by the Stockholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute that is not related
to the Merger, this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements, the Escrow
Agreement, the Parent Stockholder Agreement, the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby arises between Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and a third
party other than a party to any such agreement after the Closing, the
Stockholder may not assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of a pre-merger Confidential Communications by SandC to such third party, unless
requested to do so by Parent (in which case the Stockholder shall assert such
privilege, and if unable then Parent or the Company may also assert such
privilege); _provided_ that SandC shall notify Parent within a reasonable period
of time prior to any such disclosure in order to provide Parent with
sufficient time to make such request.

(d) The provisions of this Section 11.5 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Stockholder Party and SandC, who are
intended third party beneficiaries hereof.

 

11.6 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating
and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless

_knowledge_ " of the Stockholder means the actual knowledge of the Voting

Agreement that would involve the disclosure of confidential supervisory
information of a Governmental Entity by any party hereto to the extent
prohibited by applicable Law, and, to the extent legally permissible,
appropriate substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or taken under
circumstances in which the limitations of this sentence apply. The Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be considered Subsidiaries of the Stockholder or
the Voting Trustee for purposes of this Agreement. Amounts used in any
calculations for purposes of this Agreement may be either positive or
negative, it being understood that the addition of a negative number shall
mean the subtraction of the absolute value of such negative number and the
subtraction of a negative number shall mean the addition of the absolute value
of such negative number. Capitalized terms used herein without definition that
are defined in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meaning assigned
to such terms in the Company Disclosure Schedule.

11.7 _No Other Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in
Article III, neither the Company nor any other person, including the
Stockholder, makes any express or implied representation or warranty with

11.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

THIS SECTION 11.8.

 



-96- 11.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
the instruments referred to herein), together with the Bank Merger Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreements, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agreement (as
defined in the Bank Merger Agreement), the Parent Stockholder Agreement, the

hereof, by and among the Voting Trustee, the Company and the trusts named
therein, and the Support Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

11.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of Law
principles.

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court located in the
State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 11.4.

11.12 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (other than by operation of Law) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that the Stockholder may assign
its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to the Certificate
Holders in proportion to such Certificate Holders respective interests in the
Trust without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ ,
that any such assignment shall not relieve the Stockholder of any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in contravention

enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except

to benefit the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties, and Section 11.5(d), which is intended to benefit each Stockholder
Party and SandC and (b) that prior to the Closing the covenants, agreements and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement are intended to benefit and
shall be enforceable by Parent Bank to the extent that the failure of any
party to this Agreement to perform or comply with such covenants, agreements
and obligations

 



-97-  would reasonably be expected to be adverse to Parent Bank under the Bank
Merger Agreement, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 

11.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

11.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
