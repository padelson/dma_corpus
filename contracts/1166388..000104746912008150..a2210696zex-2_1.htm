On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time on the date that is no earlier than February 1, 2013 after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article V_ (other than those conditions that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those conditions) or at such other place, time or date as Victory and Chucktaylor agree in writing; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that in the event that, after consulting with the staff of the Commission,      

Victory acting in good faith determines to present the consolidated financial
statements of Victory in accordance with the Victory Accounting Obligations,
the Closing will occur, as promptly as practicable, following the respective
filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K by each of Chuck and Chucktaylor with
the Commission for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 and the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article V_
(other than those conditions that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those
conditions). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

  

 1.02 _ The Merger_. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Chucktaylor will be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the provisions of the DLLCA and the NYBCL. At the Effective Time of the Merger, Merger Sub will be the surviving entity and continue its existence as a limited liability company under the State of Delaware (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and will continue to be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Victory, and the separate corporate existence of Chucktaylor will cease. 

  

 (b) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Parties will file certificates of merger (together, the " _Certificates of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Department of State of the State of New York, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DLLCA and the NYBCL. The Merger will become effective at such date and time as is specified in the Certificates of Merger and as is agreed to by Victory and Chucktaylor (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DLLCA and the NYBCL. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Chucktaylor and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Company and all debts, liabilities and duties of Chucktaylor and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company. 

  

 (d) The certificate of formation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time will be and remain the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided in the operating agreement of the Surviving Company or by applicable Law. The operating agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be and remain the operating agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 (e) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Company until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified in the manner provided by the certificate of formation and operating agreement of the Surviving Company or as otherwise provided by applicable Law. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Company until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified in the manner provided by the certificate of formation and operating agreement of the Surviving Company or as otherwise provided by applicable Law. 

  

 1.03 _ Conversion Of Equity Securities In The Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Chucktaylor, Victory, Merger Sub or any of the holders of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) _ Limited Liability Company Interest of Merger Sub._ The 100% limited liability company interests in Merger Sub issued to Victory and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will by virtue of the Merger be unaffected by the Merger and will remain outstanding, and Victory will continue as the sole member of the Surviving Company. 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Victory-Owned Stock._ Each share of Chucktaylor Common Stock that is owned by Chucktaylor as treasury stock and any shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock owned by Victory or Merger Sub will be automatically canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

      

  

 (c) _ Effect on Victory Common Stock and Victory Preferred Stock._ Each share of Victory Common Stock not owned by Chucktaylor issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding after the Effective Time. Each share of Victory Common Stock and Victory Preferred Stock that is owned by Chucktaylor immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Victory Preferred Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not owned by Chucktaylor will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and will be converted into Victory Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. 

  

 (d) _ Conversion of Chucktaylor Common Stock._ Subject to _Section 1.07_, each issued and outstanding share of Chucktaylor Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 1.03(b)_) will be converted into the right to receive that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Victory Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The shares of Victory Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 1.03(d)_ and cash, without interest, in lieu of fractional shares as contemplated by _Section 1.07_ are referred to collectively as " _Merger Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and any holder of a certificate or book-entry shares formerly representing any such shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate or book-entry share. The issuance of Victory Common Stock in connection with the Merger is referred to as the " _Victory Stock Issuance_." 

  

  

 1.04 _ Exchange Of Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, Victory will appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Victory will deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_ through the Exchange Agent, evidence in book entry form representing the shares of Victory Common Stock issuable pursuant to this _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock (such shares of Victory Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Victory Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this _Article I_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.  

  

 1.05 _ Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger, and to the extent not previously distributed in connection with the Distribution, the Exchange Agent will mail to any holder of record of outstanding shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.03_, (a) a letter of transmittal and (b) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of any shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock for Merger Consideration. Upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of the letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Chucktaylor Common Stock will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article I_. Until exchanged as contemplated by this _Section 1.05_, any Chucktaylor Common Stock will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such exchange the Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 1.03_. 

  

 1.06 _ No Further Ownership Rights In Chucktaylor Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ upon conversion of any shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock, and after the Effective Time there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Chucktaylor Common 

        

Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of
Chucktaylor Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article I_.

  

 1.07 _ No Fractional Shares_. (a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Victory Common Stock will be issued upon the conversion of Chucktaylor Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.03_, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Victory Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section 1.07_, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled will be aggregated, and calculations will be rounded to three decimal places. 

  

 (b) Fractional shares of Victory Common Stock that would otherwise be allocable to any former holders of Chucktaylor Common Stock in the Merger will be aggregated, and no holder of Chucktaylor Common Stock will receive cash equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Victory Common Stock.

portion of the Exchange Fund (and all dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.08_) remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock as of a date which is

By virtue of the Merger, each Chucktaylor Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested and exercisable (including each such Chucktaylor Option that remains outstanding due to the fact that it was not previously exercised as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence), will become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, and then will be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the holder thereof will, subject to applicable tax withholdings, be entitled to receive from Chucktaylor an amount in cash, if any, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average Closing Price, minus (B) the exercise price per share of Chucktaylor Common Stock subject to such Chucktaylor Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest cent, and (ii) the total number of shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock subject to such Chucktaylor Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration, less applicable tax withholding, will be paid by Chucktaylor in a lump sum, without interest, immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Chucktaylor Unit that constitutes, either in whole or in part, a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, will, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, instead become a vested right to receive the Unit Consideration, payable when such Chucktaylor Unit would otherwise have been settled in accordance with its terms.

Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average Closing Price, with the aggregate
amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest cent and (ii) the total
number of shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock subject to such Chucktaylor Cash
Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cash Unit
Consideration_ "). The Cash Unit Consideration, less applicable tax
withholding, will be paid by Chucktaylor in a lump sum, without interest,
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Chucktaylor Cash Unit that constitutes, either in whole or in part, a
deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, will, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, instead become a vested right
to receive the Cash Unit Consideration, payable by Chucktaylor when such
Chucktaylor Cash Unit would otherwise have been settled in accordance with its

The Parties will, together with Deloitte and Touche LLP, agree upon accounting procedures regarding the preparation and Deloitte and Touche LLP\'s review of the Closing Date Positive Net Worth Statement. Victory will be entitled to reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the material premises, properties, personnel, accountants, books, records, Contracts and documents of or pertaining to Chucktaylor that Victory may reasonably request and that is readily available to Chucktaylor or may be prepared or compiled by or at the request of Chucktaylor without undue burden, to the extent that such information is reasonably required by Victory in order to complete its review of the Closing Date Positive Net Worth Statement, including the basis of Chucktaylor\'s calculation of the Retained Assets and Retained Liabilities in such detail as will permit Victory to understand clearly such calculations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Chucktaylor hereby agrees, on its behalf and on behalf of Chuck, that the Accounting Review Requirements and the Accounting Review Costs with respect to the Applicable Tax Returns for the taxable year ended January 31, 2012 are subject to the prior written approval of Victory (as each such term is defined in the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement), which will not be unreasonably withheld.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Review Costs for the Applicable Tax Returns for the taxable period ended January 31, 2012 are subject to the prior written approval of Victory, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld (the " _Approved Accounting Review Costs_ "). 

   

 (c) Chucktaylor will use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary or proper to consummate the Distribution or the Chuck Disposition as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.

 4.04 _ Public Announcements_. Victory and Chucktaylor will consult with each other before holding any press conferences, analyst calls or other public meetings or discussions and before publishing any press release or other public announcements with respect to the Transactions, other than any employee communications.

The Parties agree that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the Transactions will be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof. The covenants in this _Section 4.04_ will not apply to any communication regarding any action which a Party believes is a breach of this Agreement by another Party or the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 4.05 _ Notification Of Certain Matters_. (a) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, each of Victory, on behalf of itself and Merger Sub, and Chucktaylor will give prompt written notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required to consummate the Transactions, (ii) any Action commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions, the Distribution or the Chuck Disposition, the occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any event or circumstance which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements, the Distribution Agreements, or the Chuck Disposition Agreements to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof through the Effective Time, and (iii) the occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or alleged threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any event or circumstance which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to cause any condition, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements, the Distribution Agreements or the Chuck Disposition Agreements to fail to be complied with or satisfied; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 4.05(a)_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the Party receiving such notice. 

  

 (b) After the date hereof, Chucktaylor will give prompt written notice to Victory of (i) any agreement, arrangement, commitment or obligation to sell, dispose, assign or otherwise transfer any shares of Victory Preferred Stock or Victory Common Stock owned by Chucktaylor as of the date hereof, including the identity of the transferee, assignee or purchaser thereof and the date or expected date of consummation of such sale, disposition, assignment or transfer, and (ii) any Liability that becomes Known to Chucktaylor after the date hereof other than any such Liability that will be identified on the Closing Date Net Worth Positive Statement. 

  

 4.06 _ Access_. Chucktaylor will, and will cause the Chucktaylor Subsidiaries (other than Chuck and Chuck\'s Subsidiaries following the Distribution) to, afford to Victory reasonable access, during normal 

        

business hours, to all of Chucktaylor\'s properties, books, contracts,
commitments, management and other personnel, and records and all other
information concerning their business, properties and personnel as Victory or
Merger Sub may reasonably request (including consultation with appropriate
Chucktaylor Representatives with respect to litigation matters). Victory will
have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to copy any such properties,
books, contracts, commitments, records and other information or to otherwise
image hard drives or electronic data in connection with the
foregoing sentence. Victory and Merger Sub will hold, and will cause their
respective Affiliates and the Victory Representatives to hold, any nonpublic
information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chucktaylor will not be required to provide
access to or disclose information where it reasonably determines that such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or
contravene any Law or any agreement to which it is a party; _provided_ , that
Chucktaylor will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required
consents and take such other action (such as the entry into a joint defense
agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-client privilege)
to permit such access or disclosure. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 4.06_ will affect the representations, warranties or conditions to
the obligations of the Parties contained herein.

  

 4.07 _ Preparation Of SEC Filings_. As soon as practicable following the date of the Distribution Shareholder Meeting or such other time as may be agreed upon by Chucktaylor and Victory, to the extent such filings are required by applicable Law, (i) Victory will prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-4 (or other appropriate form) (the " _Victory Form S-4_") to register the shares of Victory Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, (ii) Victory will prepare and file with the Commission a proxy statement (the " _Victory Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Victory Stockholder Approval (which Victory Proxy Statement may be included in the Victory Form S-4), (iii) Chucktaylor will prepare and file with the Commission a proxy statement, which, to the extent applicable, may be an amendment to the Distribution Proxy Statement (as defined below) (the " _Chucktaylor Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Chucktaylor Shareholder Approval (which Chucktaylor Proxy Statement, if it is not reflected in an amendment to the Distribution Proxy Statement and is included in the Victory Form S-4, is in a form reasonably acceptable to Victory), (iv) Chucktaylor will, to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect the Merger, prepare and file with the Commission one or more amendments to the preliminary proxy statement filed by Chucktaylor with the Commission on June 7, 2012 (the " _Distribution Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Distribution Shareholder Approval, (v) Chucktaylor will, to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect the Merger, cause Chuck to prepare and file with the Commission one or more amendments to the registration statement on Form 10 filed by Chuck with the Commission on June 7, 2012 (the " _Chuck Form 10_") relating to the Distribution and (vi) the Parties will file such other documents with the Commission or applicable state securities regulators as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the Merger. Each of Victory and Chucktaylor will use their reasonable best efforts to have the Victory Form S-4, and any other registration statements as may be required declared effective under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing. Victory will use its best reasonable efforts to cause the Victory Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Victory Stockholders after the Victory Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act (or at such earlier time as the Parties deem appropriate). Chucktaylor will use its best reasonable efforts to cause the Chucktaylor Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Chucktaylor Shareholders after the Victory Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act (or such earlier time as the Parties deem appropriate). Each of Chucktaylor and Victory will also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Transactions. Victory will furnish all information concerning Victory and Merger Sub, and Chucktaylor will furnish all information concerning Chucktaylor and Chuck, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Chucktaylor Filings and the Victory Filings.

the Victory Proxy Statement, the Victory Form S-4 or the Chuck Form 10 (if
such document or supplement includes reference to the Merger) will be made
without providing the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Victory, Merger Sub, Chucktaylor, Chuck or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
Victory or Chucktaylor which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Chucktaylor Proxy Statement, the Distribution Proxy Statement
(if such document includes reference to the Merger), the Victory Proxy
Statement, the Victory Form S-4 or the Chuck Form 10 (if such
document includes reference to the Merger) so that any such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information will promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed
with the Commission and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
applicable stockholders. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the
receipt of (i) all orders and notices of effectiveness of the Commission
relating to the Victory Form S-4 or the Chuck Form 10 (if such document
includes reference to the Merger), and (ii) any comments from the Commission
or its staff and of any request by the Commission or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Chucktaylor Proxy Statement, the Distribution Proxy
Statement (if such document includes reference to the Merger), the Victory
Proxy Statement, the Victory Form S-4 or the Chuck Form 10 (if such
document includes reference to the Merger) or for additional information and
will supply each other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the Commission or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect thereto and will respond as promptly as practicable
to any such comments or requests.

Victory may adjourn or postpone the Victory Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Victory Proxy Statement that it determines in good faith is required by Law (which determination will not be made until after consultation with Chucktaylor, except with respect to any Victory Superior Proposal or as otherwise provided in _Section 4.11_) to be provided to the Victory Stockholders in advance of the Victory Stockholder Meeting, (ii) if, as of the time that the Victory Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Victory Common Stock represented (either in person or proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Victory Stockholder Meeting, or (iii) if, as of the time that the Victory Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, adjournment of the Victory Stockholder Meeting is necessary to enable Victory to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes in favor of the Victory Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section 4.11_, Victory will, through its board of directors and the Special Committee, recommend to its stockholders that they give Victory Stockholder Approval and will include such recommendation in the Victory Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Victory agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 4.08_ will not be affected by the withdrawal or modification by the board of directors of Victory or the Special Committee of their recommendations of the Victory Stockholder Approval.

Shareholders in advance of the Chucktaylor Shareholder Meeting, (ii) if, as of
the time that Chucktaylor Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Chucktaylor Common Stock represented (either in person
or proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Chucktaylor Shareholder Meeting, or (iii) if, as of the time that the
Chucktaylor Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, adjournment of the Chucktaylor
Shareholder Meeting is necessary to enable Chucktaylor to solicit additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes in favor of the Chucktaylor
Shareholder Approval. Subject to _Section 4.10_, Chucktaylor will, through
its board of directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give the
Chucktaylor Shareholder Approval and will include such recommendation in the
Chucktaylor Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Chucktaylor agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 4.09_ will not be affected by the withdrawal
or modification by the board of directors of Chucktaylor of its
recommendation of the Chucktaylor Shareholder Approval.

  

 4.10 _ No Solicitation By Chucktaylor_. (a) Chucktaylor will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Chucktaylor Superior Proposal and, except as permitted by _Section 4.10(b)_, Chucktaylor will not modify, waive, amend or release any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreements entered into with prospective purchasers of Chucktaylor prior to the date of this Agreement and Chucktaylor will request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information relating to Victory that was previously furnished to any such Person in connection therewith. From and after the date of this Agreement, Chucktaylor will not, nor will it authorize or permit any of the Chucktaylor Subsidiaries to, and it will cause its or the Chucktaylor Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, employees and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Chucktaylor Superior Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Chucktaylor Superior Proposal.

 (i) furnish information with respect to Chucktaylor to the Person making such Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that Chucktaylor determines in good faith is not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreements (provided that all such information has previously been provided to Victory or is provided to Victory prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person); and 

  

 (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal. 

  

      

                                    

    

 (c) Neither the board of directors of Chucktaylor nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Victory, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Victory, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the board of directors of Chucktaylor of this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements or any of the Transactions, including the Chucktaylor Shareholder Approval, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or permit Chucktaylor or any Chucktaylor Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Chucktaylor Shareholder Approval, the board of directors of Chucktaylor determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Chucktaylor under applicable Law, then, on the fifth Business Day following Victory\'s receipt of written notice from Chucktaylor, the board of directors of Chucktaylor may withdraw or modify its recommendation of the Chucktaylor Shareholder Approval, and, in connection therewith, recommend such Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that (A) during such five-Business Day period, Chucktaylor will be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Victory and the Special Committee regarding any modification to this Agreement proposed by Victory or the Special Committee and (B) in the event of any material change to the material terms of such Chucktaylor Superior Proposal, Chucktaylor shall have delivered to Victory an additional notice and the notice period shall have recommenced, unless the event requiring notice pursuant to this _Section 4.10_ occurred less than five Business Days prior to the Chucktaylor Shareholder Meeting, as the case may be, in which case Chucktaylor will deliver notice to Victory of such event as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (d) Chucktaylor will, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any case within 24 hours following receipt by Chucktaylor), advise Victory orally and in writing of any Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Chucktaylor Superior Proposal, and the identity of the Person making any such Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any such Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Chucktaylor will (i) keep Victory reasonably informed of the status including any change to the material terms of any such Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Victory as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any case within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof) copies of all written diligence material sent or provided by Chucktaylor to any third party in connection with any Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal, which was not otherwise previously provided or made available to Victory or its Representatives. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.10_ will prohibit Chucktaylor from making any disclosure to the Chucktaylor Shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Chucktaylor after consulting with outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 4.10(e)_ will not eliminate or modify (x) Chucktaylor\'s obligations under the proviso in _Section 4.10(c)_ or (y) the effect that taking and disclosing any such position would otherwise have under this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 6.02(b)(ii)(B)_.  

  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

  

 (i) " _Qualifying Chucktaylor Takeover Proposal_ " means a bona fide, written proposal by a third party for an acquisition, merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving Chucktaylor pursuant to which the Chucktaylor Shareholders immediately preceding such transaction hold securities representing less than 50% of the total outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction (A) is made by a Person the board of directors of Chucktaylor reasonably determines, in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel and independent financial advisors, is reasonably capable of making a Chucktaylor 

  

      

  

Superior Proposal, (B) that the board of directors of Chucktaylor reasonably
determines, in good faith, after consulting with its independent financial
advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Chucktaylor
Superior Proposal, and (C) that was not solicited by Chucktaylor and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 4.10_.

   

 (ii) " _Chucktaylor Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal made by a third party for an acquisition, merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving Chucktaylor pursuant to which the Chucktaylor Shareholders immediately preceding such transaction hold securities representing less than 50% of the total outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction on terms which the board of directors of Chucktaylor determines in its good faith judgment after consulting with its independent financial advisor (A) to be superior from a financial point of view to the Chucktaylor Shareholders than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Victory to amend the terms of the Transactions) and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; 

  

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, (x) any proposal for the
sale or disposition (by merger, consolidation, sale or disposition of capital
stock or other assets, or otherwise) involving the acquisition of only Chuck
and its Subsidiaries (a " _Chuck Disposition_ ") by an unaffiliated third
party (the " _Acquiror_ ") will not constitute either a Qualifying Chucktaylor
Takeover Proposal or a Chucktaylor Superior Proposal and (y) Chucktaylor will

 4.11 _ _ _No Solicitation By Victory_. (a) Victory will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Victory Superior Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, Victory will not, nor will it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and it will cause its or its Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, employees and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Victory Superior Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Victory Superior Proposal. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.11(a)_, prior to receipt of the Victory Stockholder Approval, Victory may, if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Victory to the Victory Stockholders under applicable Law, as determined in good faith after consulting with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, in response to a Qualifying Victory Proposal (and subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section 4.11_): 

  

  

 (i) furnish information with respect to Victory to the Person making such Qualifying Victory Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement that Victory determines in good faith is not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreements (provided that all such information has previously been provided to Chucktaylor or is provided to Chucktaylor prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person); and 

  

 (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Qualifying Victory Proposal. 

  

  

 (c) Neither the board of directors of Victory nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Chucktaylor, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Chucktaylor, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the board of directors of 

        

Victory of this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements or any of the
Transactions, including the Victory Stockholder Approval, (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or permit Victory or any Victory Subsidiary to enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
relating to any Qualifying Victory Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Qualifying
Victory Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the
Victory Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of Victory determines in
good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Victory under applicable Law, then, on the fifth Business Day
following Chucktaylor\'s receipt of written notice from Victory, the board
of directors of Victory may withdraw or modify its recommendation of the
Victory Stockholder Approval, and, in connection therewith, recommend such
Qualifying Victory Proposal; _provided_ that (A) during such five-Business
Day period, Victory will be obligated to negotiate in good faith with
Chucktaylor regarding any modification to this Agreement proposed by
Chucktaylor and (B) in the event of any material change to the material terms
of such Victory Superior Proposal, Victory shall have delivered to
Chucktaylor an additional notice and the notice period shall have recommenced,
unless the event requiring notice pursuant to this _Section 4.11_ occurred
less than five Business Days prior to the Victory Stockholder Meeting, in
which case Victory will deliver notice to Chucktaylor of such event as
promptly as practicable.

  

 (d) Victory will, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any case within 24 hours following receipt by Victory), advise Chucktaylor orally and in writing of any Qualifying Victory Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Victory Superior Proposal, and the identity of the Person making any such Qualifying Victory Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any such Qualifying Victory Proposal or inquiry. Victory will keep Chucktaylor reasonably informed of the status including any change to the material terms of any such Qualifying Victory Proposal or inquiry. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.11_ will prohibit Victory from making any disclosure to the Victory Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Victory after consulting with outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 4.11(e)_ will not eliminate or modify (x) Victory\'s obligations under the proviso in _Section 4.11(c)_ or (y) the effect that taking and disclosing any such position would otherwise have under this Agreement pursuant to   _Section 6.02(c)(ii)(B)_.

 (ii) " _Victory Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal made by a third party for an acquisition, merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving Victory pursuant to which the Victory Stockholders immediately preceding such transaction hold securities representing less than 50% of the total outstanding voting power 

  

      

  

of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, on terms which the
board of directors of Victory determines in its good faith judgment after
consulting with its independent financial advisor (A) to be superior from a
financial point of view to the Victory Stockholders than the Transactions,
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any proposal by Chucktaylor to amend the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (B) is reasonably capable of being

 (b) Within ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Parties will amend the Certificate of Designation to provide that each share of Victory Preferred Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, at the Closing, automatically, without any further action by the holder thereof, be cancelled and cease to exist and will be converted into Victory Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.

Prior to the Effective Time, Chucktaylor will not, and will cause the Chucktaylor Subsidiaries not to, amend, modify or waive, grant any waiver under, make any election pursuant to, give any consent under, or agree to any of the foregoing, any Distribution Agreement or any Chuck Disposition Agreements, or to enter into any agreements (other than the Distribution Agreements or Chuck Disposition Agreements) that would result in a failure to have a Closing Date Positive Net Worth or otherwise adversely affect Victory or Chucktaylor or their respective rights under this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Chucktaylor will comply with each of its obligations under each of the Distribution Agreements or, if applicable, the Chuck Disposition Agreements. If Chucktaylor elects to pursue and consummate a Chuck Disposition, as a condition to entering into any Chuck Disposition Agreement, Chucktaylor hereby agrees that the Chuck Disposition Agreements will include terms, conditions, rights or privileges that provide, in all material respects, terms, conditions, rights or privileges as set forth in any of the Distribution Agreements that are for the benefit of Chucktaylor, including any right of indemnity of Chucktaylor under the Distribution Agreements and the Escrow Agreement (collectively, the " _Chucktaylor Provisions_ ").

limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties will use its respective
reasonable best efforts consistent with the respective fiduciary duties of
each Parties\' board of directors to defend such litigation so as to permit
the consummation of the Transactions in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party agrees that it will not
compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including the
Merger), unless any such compromise or settlement includes a full release of
the other Party and its Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Chucktaylor,
if the Distribution has occurred, Chuck and its Subsidiaries), without the
other Party\'s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder will affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or remedy.

Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character of any breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision of this Agreement must satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section 7.06(a)_ and will be effective only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.

 7.09 _ _ _Construction_. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a substantive part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement, the Victory Disclosure Letter or Chucktaylor Disclosure Letter will include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns, pronouns, and verbs will include the plural and vice versa. Reference to any agreement, document, or instrument means such agreement, document, or instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. The use of the words "include" or "including" in this Agreement or the 

        

Victory Disclosure Letter or Chucktaylor Disclosure Letter will be by way of
example rather than by limitation. The use of the words "or," "either" or
"any" will not be exclusive. The use of the words "deliver," "furnish," "made
available" or "provide" will mean that, with respect to either Party, as the
context requires, or its respective Representatives, that such documents or
information referenced shall have been delivered to the other Party or its
Representatives or contained in the electronic data room maintained by the
Party delivering such information at least two Business Days prior to the
date of this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Other Transaction
Agreements. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties,
and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any
Other Transaction Agreement, any provision herein which contemplates the
agreement, approval or consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such
Party may give or withhold such agreement, approval or consent, or exercise
such right, in its sole and absolute discretion, the Parties hereby expressly
disclaiming any implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or similar
concept.

 7.11 _ _ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No Party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense. 

  

 7.12 _ _ _Specific Performance_.
