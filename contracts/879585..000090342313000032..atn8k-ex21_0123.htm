Accountant such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to
the Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant may request. The
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Purchaser and Sellers absent manifest error. The fees, expenses
and costs of the American Arbitration Association and the Independent
Accountant shall be borne in the same proportion as the aggregate value of the
Unresolved Items that are unsuccessfully disputed by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, (as determined by the Independent
Accountant) bears to the total value of the Unresolved Items submitted to the
Independent Accountant.

LLC. Immediately prior to and immediately following the Newco Transfer and the

writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Authority, or any civil,
criminal or administrative action, claim, litigation, arbitration,
investigation, hearing or other proceeding of or before any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened,
against Sellers or any of their Affiliates relating to the Business, or the
FCC Licenses, or that questions the validity of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement or any action taken or
required to be taken pursuant to this Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement or in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit such transactions
or to obtain damages or other relief in connection with this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement, other than any civil actions, claims,
litigation, arbitrations, investigations, hearings or other proceedings or any
group of substantially similar civil actions, claims, litigation,
arbitrations, investigations, hearings or other proceedings, which
individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a Material

any Third Party consents that are required under the Transferred IP Contracts
or the Transferred Contracts, and the transition services to be made available
to Purchaser pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the Transferred
Assets constitute all of the rights, services, arrangements, tangible and
intangible assets and property (including Intellectual Property) necessary to
conduct the Business in all material respects as it is presently conducted on
the date of this Agreement and as necessary to conduct the Business
immediately following the Closing on the same basis and to the same extent

Letter contains a true and complete copy of financial statements in respect of
the Business, consisting of balance sheets as of November 30, 2012 and
statements of income for the eleven months ending November 30, 2012 (the
"Financial Statements"). Each of the Financial Statements has been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, as consistently applied, for all periods presented,
subject to normal year end audit adjustments that would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business
taken as a whole, and the absence of notes. Each of the Financial Statements
has been derived from the historical books and records of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries, and presents fairly in all material respects the financial
position and results of operations of the Business as of the respective dates
and for the respective periods indicated.

  

  

Section 3.8 Absence of Liabilities. Except as reflected or reserved against on
or otherwise disclosed on the face of the Financial Statements, neither
Sellers nor any of their Affiliates has any Liabilities with respect to the
Business that will constitute Assumed Liabilities, other than those (a)

(ii) FCC call sign, license number or other license identifier, (iii) the
geographic area for which Sellers and their Affiliates are authorized to
provide service, (iv) current expiration date, (v) frequency block (except for
microwave licenses) and (vi) where applicable, the relevant market and service

ordinary course imposed on any of the FCC Licenses by the FCC (including any
condition on the grant of a renewal application) that is not disclosed on the
face of the reference copy of the FCC License in the FCC's Universal Licensing
System database; provided that ordinary course shall include any condition
described in any federal statutes, FCC regulations, orders or similar sources
that applies generally to FCC licenses of the applicable radio service.

  

  

(b) Schedule 1D sets forth a list of each leased FCC License that will be
assigned as part of the Transferred Assets (the "Leases"). Sellers and the
Seller Entities are not, nor, to the Knowledge of Sellers, is any other party
to any of the material Leases, in breach or default under the Leases, and any
material breach or default that has been asserted by such other party has been
waived, cured or otherwise settled. Sellers and the Seller Entities have not,
nor has any other party to any of the Leases claimed in any written statement
that the counterparty is in breach or default under the Leases and any past
breach or default has been waived, cured or otherwise settled. For purposes of
this Section 3.9(b), any breach of a payment obligation shall be deemed
material. No party to any Lease has claimed in writing, and no party has
threatened, in any written statement to Sellers or any of their Affiliates
that the party has a right to terminate any Lease at any time or to seek
damages against Sellers or any of their Affiliates for an alleged violation,

terminated or forfeited or adversely modified; (ii) there is no proceeding
pending before the FCC (and no pending judicial review of such a proceeding)
or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened by a Person with respect to any
FCC License, Lease, Sellers or any of Sellers' Affiliates that, individually
or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to result in the suspension,
revocation, cancellation, termination, forfeiture, or adverse modification of
any FCC License or Lease; and (iii) to the Knowledge of Sellers, no event,
condition or circumstance would preclude any FCC License from being renewed in
the ordinary course (to the extent that such FCC License or Lease is renewable
by its terms).

  

  

(d) The licensee of each FCC License and the lessee of each Lease is in
material compliance with the terms of the rules, regulations and orders of the
FCC (the "FCC Rules") and any other Laws that apply to or that are contained
in, each FCC License and the FCC Licenses underlying the Leases and has timely
fulfilled and performed all of its material obligations with respect thereto,
including all reports, notifications and applications to the FCC). Sellers
have provided Purchaser with access to copies of each such report, including
ownership reports and regulatory fee filings, filed in the last three (3)
years, with the exception of those reports that are available in their
entirety in the FCC's Universal Licensing System database. Sellers have not
incurred, or if incurred Sellers have fully discharged, any fine, charge or
other liability resulting from any noncompliance prior to the Closing relating
to such reports. Sellers have timely made the payment of all regulatory fees,
contributions to the Universal Service Fund, the TRS Fund and all other such
funds to which contributions are required by the FCC Rules.

antenna structures used for the operation of the FCC Licenses and Leases has

lessee of the structure, to the Knowledge of Sellers, by the lessor, or an
Affiliate of the lessor, of the structure.

  

  

(f) All of the currently operating cell sites and microwave paths of the
Sellers and their Affiliates relating to the Business, in respect of which a
filing with the FCC was required, have been constructed and are currently

preceded by the submission to the FCC of all required filings.

  

  

(g) There is no debt existing, outstanding or owing to the FCC or any
Governmental Authority with respect to the FCC Licenses or Leases. No amounts
are due and owing to the FCC by reason of the ownership or operation pursuant
to the FCC Licenses or Leases and all fees and contributions required to be
paid to the FCC by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the FCC
Licenses or Leases have been timely paid.

(h) No payments to the FCC or the United States Treasury for or with respect
to any FCC License or Lease, including annual regulatory fee payments for the
FCC Licenses and Leases assessed under Section 1.1152 of the FCC Rules are due
or are overdue. There is no payment owed to the FCC, the United States
Treasury or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any FCC License
or Lease.

  

  

(i) None of the FCC Licenses has been modified by Sellers or their Affiliates
in any respect, including through disaggregation and/or partition, and there
is no pending or planned application by Sellers or their Affiliates to modify
any FCC License.

forfeiture.

  

  

Section 3.10 Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) Section 3.10(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and

(b) Sellers or one of their Affiliates exclusively owns all right, title and
interest in all of the Transferred Intellectual Property and has the right to
transfer to Newco all the Transferred Intellectual Property, free and clear of
all Liens, other than Permitted Liens and non-exclusive licenses granted in
the ordinary course of business. The Transferred Intellectual Property (i) is,
to the Knowledge of Sellers, valid, subsisting and enforceable and will
continue to be so immediately following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) is not subject to any outstanding
order, judgment, decree or agreement adversely affecting in any material
respect the use thereof or rights therein.

  

  

(c) The Transferred Network Assets constitute all of the Network Assets, other
than those Excluded Assets listed in Section 3.10(c) of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter, used in, or held for use in, or necessary for, the conduct of the
Business as it is presently conducted on the date of this Agreement and
conducted immediately following the Closing. To the Knowledge of Sellers, the
Sellers and their Affiliates have taken commercially reasonable steps in
accordance with industry standards to maintain the Transferred Network Assets
and to secure the Transferred Network Assets from unauthorized access or use
by any Person.

  

  

(d) To the Knowledge of Sellers, the conduct of the Business as currently

Sellers' or their Affiliates' use of the Transferred Intellectual Property or
Sellers' or any of their Affiliates' use of the Intellectual Property licensed
by Sellers or any of their Affiliates from another Person under a Transferred
IP Contract, does not infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property of any other Person. To the Knowledge of Sellers, none
of the Transferred Intellectual Property has been infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise violated by any other Person.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 32 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) There is not and has not been any litigation, opposition, cancellation,
proceeding, objection or claim pending, asserted or, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, threatened in writing against Sellers or their Affiliates concerning
the ownership, validity, registerability, enforceability, infringement or use
of any Transferred Intellectual Property, or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, the
use of Intellectual Property licensed under a Transferred IP Contract.

  

  

(f) Except for handsets and other products sold in the ordinary course of
business, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no product or service of Sellers or any
of their Affiliates is distributed with any software (including source code or
object code) that is licensed pursuant to an "open source" or other third-
party license agreement that requires the disclosure or licensing of any
Transferred Intellectual Property (including source code). Neither Sellers nor
any of their Affiliates participate or have participated in any standard-
setting organization that requires Sellers, any of their Affiliates, Newco or
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to grant a license, covenant not to sue
or similar right under any Transferred Intellectual Property or any
Intellectual Property owned by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

Section 3.11 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Sellers have prepared and timely filed (taking into account any valid
extension of time within which to file) or caused to be filed all material Tax
Returns relating to the Transferred Assets, the Partnerships and the
Transferred LLCs required to be filed on or before the Closing Date (the

which adequate reserves have been established on the Financial Statements.

  

  

(d) From its formation and as of the Closing, Newco will be disregarded as an
entity distinct from Sellers for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No
Transferred LLC has made an election to be treated as an association taxable
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and each has from its
inception been disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an entity
distinct from Sellers. Each Partnership will have made an election under
Section 754 of the Code prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 33 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Neither (i) Sellers nor any of their Affiliates (with respect to the

adjustments in controversy or requests for information.

  

  

(f) Neither the Partnerships, nor the Transferred LLCs have engaged in any
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, a transaction

Section 1.6011-4(b) (including any transaction which the Internal Revenue
Service has determined to be a "listed transaction" for purposes of
1.6011-4(b)(2)). Neither the Partnerships, nor the Transferred LLCs have
engaged in a transaction of which it made disclosure to any taxing authority
to avoid penalties under Section 6662(d) or any comparable provision of state,
foreign or local law.

  

  

(g) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any
liability or other obligation of the Sellers or Purchaser to any Partnership
or any partner thereof as a result of or in connection with the indirect
transfer of the interests in such Partnership pursuant to this Agreement being
treated as a termination of such Partnership within the meaning of Section
708(b)(1)(B) of the Code.

Section 3.13 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Section 3.13(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each Business Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Business Benefit Plan" shall mean any benefit plan, program,
arrangement or agreement, whether written or unwritten, including any such
plan, program, arrangement or agreement that is an employee welfare benefit
plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not such employee
welfare benefit plan is subject to ERISA, an employee pension benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") (whether or not
such Pension Plan is subject to ERISA) or health, medical, dental, disability,
sick leave, accident or life insurance or a bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, restricted stock or
other equity-based award, severance, termination, retention, retirement,
savings, employment, change of control, vacation, perquisite or fringe benefit
plan, program, arrangement or agreement which benefits the current or former
employees of Sellers or any of their Affiliates engaged in the Business, or
independent contractors or consultants of the Business or, as applicable, any
entity that shall constitute Transferred Assets, or to which Sellers or any of
their Affiliates sponsors, maintains or contributes to or in respect of which
has any liability, whether contingent or otherwise, arising from or related to
the Business. Sellers have made available to Purchaser prior to the date of
this Agreement true and complete copies of all of the Business Benefit Plans
listed in Section 3.13(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (or a written
summary of any unwritten Business Benefit Plan), all material amendments
thereto and a Schedule disclosing for each Business Employee as of December
2012, the service date, exempt/non-exempt status, annual base salary and work
location as of December 2012.

  

  

(b) Each of the Business Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in
accordance with its terms and in material compliance with Law, including ERISA
and the Code. Neither Sellers nor their Subsidiaries have engaged in a
transaction and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no condition exists with respect
to any Business Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such
transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement (in the case of a Tax or
penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code), would reasonably be expected to
subject the Business or any Business Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Each of the
Business Benefit Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code (i) has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") , and Sellers are not aware of any
circumstances reasonably likely to result in the loss of the qualification of
such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) has been administered in
accordance with its terms and in material compliance with Law. All
contributions required to be made under each of the Business Benefit Plans by
Law or pursuant to the express terms of the applicable plan have been timely
made when due.

  

  

(c) None of Sellers, any of their Subsidiaries nor any entity which is
considered one employer with Sellers under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (whether or not incorporated, an "ERISA Affiliate") has
incurred any Liability (other than payment of premiums) under Title IV of
ERISA that could reasonably be expected to become a Liability of Purchaser.
Neither Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliates has now or at any time within the
previous six years contributed to, sponsored or maintained (i) any
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or
single employer plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA);
(ii) a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code or (iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA. None of the Business Benefit Plans provides retiree
medical, disability, life insurance or other retiree welfare benefits.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 35 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) With respect to each Business Benefit Plan, (i) no actions, suits or
claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are
pending or threatened in writing, (ii) no facts or circumstances exist that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or
claims, (iii) no written or oral communication has been received from the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") concerning the funded status
of any such plan or any transfer of assets and liabilities from any such plan
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, and (iv) no
administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the
United States Department of Labor, the PBGC, the IRS or other Governmental
Authority has been instituted or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened
(including any routine requests for information from the PBGC).

  

  

(e) Neither Sellers nor any Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with a labor union
respecting the Business Employees. In respect of the Business and the Business
Employees: (i) the Sellers and their Subsidiaries are in material compliance
with all applicable Laws respecting employment, employment practices and terms
and conditions of employment, including wages and hours and the classification
and payment of employees and independent contractors, collective bargains,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, workers' compensation,
collection of withholding taxes, social security and similar taxes, and are
not engaged in any unfair labor practices, as defined in the National Labor
Relations Act; (ii) there is no pending, or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
threatened, labor dispute, work slowdown, picketing or strike at either
Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries, and there have been no such disputes or
activities for the three years prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii)
there are no complaints, charges, or claims against the Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened in
writing to be brought or filed with any Governmental Authority based on,
arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or
termination of employment of any individual by Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries; and (iv) there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint
against the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge
of Sellers, threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or other
Governmental Authority.

  

  

(f) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or together
with any other event) (i) entitle any employees, officers or consultants of
the Sellers or their Subsidiaries to severance, change of control or other
similar pay or benefits pursuant to any Business Benefit Plan, (ii) cause any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) to become due, or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits, to any employees, officers or consultants of Sellers
or their Subsidiaries under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any
other obligation pursuant to any Business Benefit Plan or (iii) result in
payments which would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 36 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(g) Neither Sellers nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to, and neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or in combination with
another event) require Sellers or any Subsidiary to, gross up, indemnify or
otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise taxes, interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to the Code, including, but not limited to Sections
280G/4999 and 409A of the Code.

  

  

(h) Sellers have made available to Purchaser a true, correct and complete list
as of the date hereof of each employee, and each consultant or independent
contractor who are individuals and provides services to the Business. No

employees, or consultants or independent contractors that are individuals.

  

  

Section 3.14 Permits. There is no material defect in any Permit (including

Section 5.3 Transition Services.

  

  

(a) The parties shall work in good faith to negotiate and agree on, within
ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement (and in all events prior to
Closing) to enter into a Transition Services Agreement which shall provide for
(i) the mutual transitional and operational services to be provided by or to
Sellers or their Affiliates under the Transition Services Agreement (the
"Transition Services") (provided that the scope, duration and content of such
transition services that are provided will be consistent with the transition
services that are customarily provided in connection with the sale of a
business providing mobile wireless telecommunications services or other
services that are necessary to conduct the Business after the Closing in the
manner provided prior to the Closing and will include those services set forth
in Schedule 5.3(a)), and (ii) a schedule of service fees. Such service fees
will not include any margin and will be determined in accordance with the
total costs allocated to the Transition Service covered by such service fees
in the income statement for the eleven-month period ended November 30, 2012
that is included in the Financial Statements. The Transition Services
Agreement shall have a term continuing until the later of eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date and the expiration of the term of the last
Transition Service needed to support third party agreements assumed by
Purchaser including obligations under roaming contracts (e.g. CDMA roaming,
GSM roaming in Idaho). Without limitation of the foregoing, the Transition
Services to be provided by Sellers to Purchaser, and by Purchaser to Sellers,
will include, among others, services as described on Schedule 5.3(a) hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 49 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Commencing as soon as practicable after the date hereof, the parties will
begin preparing for and discussing, to the extent allowed by applicable Law,
the process of migrating the Transition Services from Sellers to Purchaser and
Purchaser to Sellers, as applicable, so that the completion of the migration
of such services shall occur as soon as practicable after the Closing Date.
The parties acknowledge that no migration will begin until after Closing. The
parties will cooperate to assure an orderly and efficient transition. The
Transition Teams appointed in accordance with Section 5.3(c) shall be
accountable for planning for and overseeing the implementation and completion
of the Transition Services in accordance with the terms hereof and the
Transition Services Agreement. Each party shall make available, as reasonably
requested by the other party, reasonably sufficient resources and, unless
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement,
shall provide decisions, approvals and acceptances within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt of such request in writing (including by email) in order
that each party may perform its obligations under this Section 5.3 in a timely
and efficient manner.

  

  

(c) Sellers and Purchaser shall each designate a team of persons that
collectively have practical knowledge and expertise in each area of the
operations of the Business that relate to the Transition Services, and are
authorized to make decisions with respect to the Transition Services
("Transition Team"). Sellers and Purchaser shall each have the right to
substitute, add or remove any of its designees on its initial Transition Team
upon prompt notice to the other parties. Sellers and Purchaser shall each
designate a member of their respective Transition Teams as team leader (the
"Team Lead") who shall have the primary responsibility and authority for
making team assignments, assessing, monitoring and reporting progress related
to the Transition Services, and resolving any disputes between the Transition
Team members or delays in performance under the Transition Services Agreement.
The initial members of the Transition Teams and each of the designated Team
Leads shall be identified, along with each person's title, areas of expertise
and relevant telecommunications, fax and email information, in writing and
submitted to the other parties prior to the initial joint meeting described in
Section 5.3(d).

  

  

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Transition Teams of each of Sellers and Purchaser shall conduct
an initial joint meeting for the purpose of defining roles, responsibilities,
scope, and timelines and commencing the development of the list of Transition
Services to be included in the Transition Services Agreement. Thereafter the
Transition Teams shall convene meetings, at least weekly, or on such other
mutually agreed upon periodic basis as required. It is the expectation of the
parties that the members of the Transition Teams shall communicate directly
with one another and work together directly with one another to ensure that
all Transition Services are completed on a timely and complete basis. The Team
Leads of Sellers' Transition Team and Purchaser's Transition Team shall meet
regularly to discuss the status of the Transition Services and performance of
each parties' obligations under the Transition Services Agreement, as well as
to answer questions, track down information, and resolve disputes that occur
from time-to-time. These meetings may be face-to-face, video or telephonic
meetings. Each party shall bear its own costs of attending meetings between
the Transition Teams. In the event that a Transition Team member or a Team
Lead shall be unavailable to work on Transition Services, then he or she shall
appoint a temporary or permanent replacement.

of Purchaser, Sellers shall permit Purchaser and its Affiliates to store
equipment at any of the owned or leased real property included in the
Transferred Assets in connection with Purchaser's transition activities,
subject to Sellers' space requirements and any other existing access rights or
limitations; provided that Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to have any such limitations removed; provided further; that in connection
with the removal of any such limitations, Sellers shall have no obligation to
make any payments to or amend any underlying agreements with the owner or
leaseholder, as applicable, of such real property. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, then Purchaser shall, at its
expense, remove and Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser and its Affiliates
in connection with transferring possession to Purchaser and its Affiliates (as
applicable) of Purchaser's and its Affiliates' equipment, if any, placed at
any Transferred Asset.

shall deliver to Purchaser a list of the Business Employees as of such date
and no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the reasonably anticipated
Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser an updated list of the
Business Employees as of such date (which identifies the number of Business
Employees on approved leave of absence), and thereafter and until the Closing
Sellers shall promptly inform Purchaser of any changes thereto. The Business
Employees shall be transferred from Sellers to Newco as of the Closing;
provided, however, that any Business Employee not actively at work at the
Closing due to worker's compensation or short-term or long-term disability or
other approved leave of absence under Sellers' applicable leave of absence
policy (each, a "Leave Employee" and collectively, the "Leave Employees")
shall not become employed by Purchaser, Newco or their Affiliates as of the
Closing, but shall become employed by Purchaser, Newco or their Affiliates
upon the return of such Business Employee to active employment at the
termination of such leave, but only if such Business Employee returns to
active employment no later than the first anniversary of the Closing (and
Sellers shall retain full liability and responsibility of such Business
Employees until they are transferred to Purchaser, Newco or their Affiliates
in accordance with this Section 5.6(a)). From the Closing through the first
anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser shall provide to each Business Employee
who is employed with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
(each, a "Transferred Employee" and collectively, the "Transferred
Employees"), provided that a Leave Employee shall not be treated as a
Transferred Employee until the expiration of the Leave Employee's period of
absence and unless such Leave Employee thereupon becomes employed by Newco no
later than the first anniversary of the Closing, annual compensation and
benefits (other than equity compensation and benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits provided
immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to any Transferred Employee who becomes subject to a collective bargaining
agreement after the Closing Date, all compensation and benefits treatment
afforded to such Transferred Employee by Newco shall be provided only in
accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

in Business Benefit Plans, and after the Closing Date, the Transferred
Employees shall participate solely in the Purchaser Plans. Sellers shall fully
indemnify Purchaser for all Liabilities arising in connection with (i) the
Business Benefit Plans and (ii) the employment of any Transferred Employee
with Sellers for any period prior to the Closing Date, in each case, other
than those Liabilities expressly assumed by Purchaser under the terms of this
Agreement. Purchaser shall fully indemnify Sellers for all Liabilities arising
in connection with (i) Purchaser Plans (as defined below) and (ii) the
employment of any Transferred Employee with Purchaser for any period after the
Closing.

  

  

(c) Except for severance and paid time-off provided pursuant to Section 5.6(d)
and 5.6(i), (i) Sellers shall be responsible for and provide to each Business
Employee all compensation and benefits which have accrued and, where relevant,
vested on behalf of such Business Employee as of the Closing under, and in
accordance with the terms of, the Business Benefit Plans, and Purchaser shall
have no liability, direct or indirect, in respect of any Business Benefit Plan
or any other benefit plan of the Seller Entities; (ii) there shall be no
transfer of assets or Liabilities from any Business Benefit Plan to any
Purchaser Plan; and (iii) Sellers shall be solely responsible for all
Liabilities arising in connection with the termination from Sellers'
employment of any Business Employee, including, without limitation, payment of
severance obligations under any Business Benefit Plan, provision of COBRA
continuation coverage and the filing of any required notices. For the
avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall pay the Business Employees all bonuses and
other incentive awards in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date, and
Purchaser shall have no responsibilities for such pre-closing bonuses and
other incentive awards.

(d) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries following the Closing
and in which any Transferred Employee participates (the "Purchaser Plans"),
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, and vesting, each
Transferred Employee's service with Sellers and their Affiliates (or
predecessor employers to the extent Sellers or their Affiliates provide past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Purchaser and/or any
applicable Subsidiary of Purchaser, including for purposes of benefit accrual
under severance, paid time-off and similar Purchaser Plans; provided that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits, for purposes of any frozen or
discontinued Purchaser Plan or any frozen or discontinued portion of a
Purchaser Plan or for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or retiree
medical plan. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i)
such service to apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or
evidence of insurability requirements, (ii) each Purchaser Plan to waive pre-
existing condition limitations for Transferred Employees (and their
beneficiaries and covered dependents) participating in such plan to the extent
waived or not applicable under the applicable Business Benefit Plan and (iii)
to provide each Transferred Employee with credit, or a cash payment of at
least $250 for each three-month period that has elapsed in the calendar year
prior to the Closing Date, grossed up for Taxes in lieu thereof, for any co-

applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans of
Purchaser that such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate in
following their Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Effective not later than the Closing, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
have in effect one or more defined contribution plans that include a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
(and a related trust exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) (as
applicable, the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan"). Each Transferred Employee
participating in a Business Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan
that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Sellers 401(k) Plan") immediately prior to
the Closing may elect to become a participant in the corresponding Purchaser
401(k) Plan as of the Closing and each Transferred Employee shall be eligible
to participate in a Purchaser 401(k) Plan as of the Closing. If and to the
extent required by the Sellers 401(k) Plan, prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall fully fund, through the Closing, all employee contributions and all
basic employer matching contributions.

establish, amend, or modify any Business Benefit Plan, any Purchaser Plan, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or
limit the ability of Purchaser, Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any Business Benefit Plan, any Purchaser Plan,
or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the

former employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period
of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment, (iv) is intended to confer or shall confer upon any
individual or any legal representative of any individual (including employees,
retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees and
including collective bargaining agents or representatives) any right as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, or (v) shall be deemed to confer
upon any such individual or legal representative any rights under or with
respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated by
this Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be
entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or
arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

(g) Each party agrees to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
comply with the Federal Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(the "WARN Act") with respect to a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act) and any other similar applicable state or local Law
regarding group terminations or similar events affecting Business Employees
(including as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). To ensure that Purchaser has sufficient information to comply
with the WARN Act and any other applicable Law, Sellers agree to notify
Purchaser as soon as practicable following the Closing of any layoffs that
included any Business Employees during the ninety (90)-day period prior to the
Closing. Purchaser agrees to provide any required notices under the WARN Act
as well as any other similar applicable local or state law pertaining to the
layoff of any Transferred Employees that occur following the Closing.

  

  

(h) Following the date of this Agreement, (i) the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate in such matters as are reasonably necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 5.6, including the exchange of
information relating to workers' compensation and employee benefits; (ii)
Sellers shall provide Purchaser the opportunity to review and consult on any

Closing employment or compensation matters to the Business Employees prior to
the Closing without first providing Sellers a reasonable opportunity to review
and consult on any such communications or notices.

the Closing a severance plan for Transferred Employees which shall provide
severance benefit payments at least as favorable as set forth on Schedule
5.6(i).

no event later than forty-five (45) days after the date hereof, Sellers shall
provide Purchaser with a true, correct and complete list disclosing for each
Business Employee as of December 2012, the employee ID, name, date of birth,

Agreement and until the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain any local
Permits and any consent, authorization, approval or similar item from any non-
governmental Third Party or any Governmental Authority acting solely as a
landlord or that is the issuer of any local Permit that is required or
appropriate as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that Purchaser shall not be required to make any payment or agree to
anything that would alter any existing rights or obligations in order to
obtain any such consent, authorization, approval or similar item. In the event
that the transfer of any Transferred Asset, including any Contract that would
be a Transferred Asset, remains subject to receipt of any such required local
Permit or Third Party consent, authorization, approval or similar item at
Closing, Sellers will not, and will cause their Affiliates not, to transfer
such asset (each such asset, a "Deferred Asset") to Newco at or prior to the
Closing. With respect to any Deferred Asset, Sellers shall (a) continue to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain such Permit, consent, authorization,
approval or similar item and (b) provide Newco with the economic and
operational benefits and burdens (which burdens Purchaser shall cause Newco to
assume, and which Purchaser agrees to guaranty) of such Deferred Asset, in
each case, without any additional cost or expense to Newco or Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates resulting from the fact that such benefits and burdens are
provided by Sellers (as opposed to being obtained directly under such Deferred
Asset), until such Permit, consent, authorization, approval or similar item is
obtained (or such benefits and burdens would no longer be applicable).

  

  

Section 5.8 Notifications. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date, each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of any breach by
such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement that is reasonably likely to make the satisfaction of the
closing conditions set forth in Article VII impossible or unlikely. Sellers
shall promptly upon receipt provide to Purchaser any written notice of non-
payment, delinquency, failure of performance, termination or other notice
received by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to any Ground Lease or
Governmental Use Permit.

  

  

Section 5.9 Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) The non-disclosure agreement, dated as of June 28, 2012, by and between
Parent and ATandT Services, Inc. (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement") shall continue
in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement and shall
terminate upon the Closing.

  

  

(b) None of the parties (or any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue
any press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement
of the other party, except as may be required by Law or the rules of any
applicable stock exchange in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party, and give the other
party a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon, before making any such
public announcement. Purchaser shall not, prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Sellers, contact any vendors of the Business in their
capacity as vendors of the Business.

and each of their Affiliates shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, treat as confidential and safeguard any and all (i)
information, knowledge and data which shall constitute Transferred Assets, and
all information about Newco and the Business by using the same degree of care,
but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized
use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as
Sellers or their Affiliates used with respect thereto prior to the execution
of this Agreement, and (ii) all knowledge, information and data received from
or on behalf of Purchaser regarding Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by using the same
degree of care, but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the
unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge
and data as Sellers use with respect to their own confidential information;
provided that such confidentiality obligations shall not apply to any
information which (w) is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure, act or omission by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives; (x) is obtained from a Third
Party; provided that such Third Party is not known by Sellers after reasonable
inquiry to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual,
legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to any other Person with
respect to such information; (y) is required to be disclosed by Sellers or
their Affiliates under any applicable Law; or (z) is required to enforce any
rights Sellers may have against, or to defend any claims made by, Purchaser or
any Third Party.

  

  

Section 5.10 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party agrees
to use, and to cause its Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to cause to be satisfied
the conditions referred to in Article VII; provided that the foregoing shall
not preclude a party from exercising its rights under this Agreement;
provided, further, that this Section 5.10 shall not impose any obligations on
Purchaser to make any filings in respect of the USF Approvals.

(b) Each of the Sellers, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall take
all reasonable actions, including filing all necessary regulatory
notifications and seeking all necessary Regulatory Approvals, in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to diligently
pursue the processing of any such applications and filings before the FCC or
DOJ and other applicable Governmental Authorities. Further, each of the
Sellers, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the FCC Consent and to cause the waiting periods under the
HSR Act to terminate or expire prior to the Termination Date. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any
restriction or condition (including any sales, divestitures, dispositions or
changes in business practice or any commitments or requirements with respect
to an Adverse Network Condition) with respect to (i) any of their existing or
future assets or operations (other than those referenced in the following
clause (ii)) or (ii) Newco, the Business, the Transferred Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, unless, in the case of this clause (ii) only, such actions,
restrictions and conditions (including any sales, divestitures, dispositions
or changes in business practice or any commitments or requirements with
respect to an Adverse Network Condition) are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, properties, operations, assets, liabilities, business or
results of operations of Newco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
Transferred Assets, taken as a whole (any of such actions, restrictions,
conditions or agreements with respect to (i) or which would have the effect
referred to in (ii) being referred to as a "Regulatory Adverse Effect."

Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in avoiding the entry of, or having
vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers and their Affiliates shall not
be permitted to agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions affecting
Newco, the Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities with
respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Purchaser.

  

  

Section 5.11 Access. Without limiting the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Sellers shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, (a) give Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and on
reasonable notice to Sellers, to the Business, Business Employees, Transferred
Assets, including environmental, zoning and other Permit and FCC License
documents and information, and Representatives of Sellers and their Affiliates
who can respond knowledgeably to questions related thereto and to transfer and

disruptive to the operations of the business of Sellers or any of their

practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than thirty
(30) days after the date hereof; provided that nothing in this Section 5.11
shall require Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries to disclose any information
to Purchaser or its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of Sellers, (i) cause significant competitive harm to
Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated hereby

Section 5.12 Allocation of Consideration. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a statement (the "Allocation
Statement") allocating the consideration paid by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement among the Transferred Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Section 1060 Allocation").
If, within fifteen (15) Business Days after delivery of the Allocation
Statement, Sellers notify Purchaser in writing that Sellers object to the
allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Purchaser and Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within twenty (20)
days. In the event Purchaser and Sellers are unable to resolve such dispute
within twenty (20) days, Purchaser and Sellers shall file their Tax Returns in
accordance with their own determinations as to the correct allocation. The
parties agree to amend the Section 1060 Allocation as necessary to reflect any
adjustments in consideration agreed upon, or payments made, after the Closing
Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.12, Purchaser and Sellers
each further agree to file, and to cause their respective Affiliates to file,
their income tax returns and all other Tax Returns and necessary forms in such
a manner as to reflect the allocation of the consideration as determined in
accordance with this Section 5.12.

aware of such event and use reasonable best efforts to collect any amounts due
in respect of any such Damaged Assets under its insurance policies (if any)
and promptly remit any such collected amounts to Purchaser at or following the
Closing; provided, however, that in lieu of delivering such collected amounts
at or prior to Closing, the Closing Purchase Price may be reduced by such
amounts collected under Sellers' insurance policies at or prior to Closing.
With respect to any Damaged Assets that are not covered by insurance or as to
which insurance proceeds are not sufficient to replace or repair such Damaged
Assets, Sellers will promptly repair or replace such Damaged Assets with
assets that are substantially comparable.

  

  

Section 5.14 Liens. The Sellers shall cause any Liens other than Permitted
Liens on the Transferred Assets (other than the Transferred LLC Interests, for
which all Liens shall be released, discharged and terminated) or assets that
would constitute Transferred Assets to be released, discharged and terminated
in full prior to the Closing.

  

  

Section 5.15 Intercompany Obligations. Sellers agree that not later than the

by Sellers or one of their Affiliates (other than Newco and its Subsidiaries)
to Newco or one of its Subsidiaries and claims relating to the Transferred
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities by Sellers and their Affiliates (including

Transferred Employee or hiring employees who respond to such general
solicitations or (ii) hiring any Transferred Employee who has previously been
terminated by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates or who has ceased to be
employed by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates for at least 30 days.

pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.18 Release. Sellers, for and on behalf of themselves and for and on
behalf of their Affiliates (other than Newco and its Subsidiaries), shall
execute at the Closing a general release and discharge, for the benefit of
Newco and its Subsidiaries, in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser,
releasing and discharging Newco and its Subsidiaries from any and all
Liabilities to Sellers or any of their Affiliates, except to the extent such

its Subsidiaries' officers and directors not to, and shall instruct and use
its best efforts to cause its and their respective Affiliates and other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate,
encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, or the making or submission of, any
proposal (whether or not it constitutes an agreement or understanding, whether
oral or written) for the direct or indirect acquisition, exchange, refinancing
of, or similar transaction involving any substantial portion of the
Transferred Assets, whether by merger, stock purchase, asset sale or
otherwise, but excluding sales of Inventory and obsolete assets in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (an "Acquisition
Proposal"), (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any nonpublic information relating or with respect to,
any Acquisition Proposal, or in response to any inquiries or proposals that
could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (c) engage
in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (d) approve, endorse, or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (e)
enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or
commitment providing for, any Acquisition Proposal. Sellers shall notify

Statements.

  

  

Section 5.22 LTE Network. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Sellers shall be
permitted to develop and deploy a LTE mobile broadband network as part of the
Business; provided that (a) the details of such development and deployment are
provided to Purchaser reasonably in advance of such development and
deployment, (b) Sellers shall consider in good faith any reasonable concerns
or suggestions communicated by Purchaser to Sellers with respect to such
development and deployment to the extent it would affect integration of
Sellers' network with that of Purchaser, and (c) such development and
deployment would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

Closing, Sellers shall have delivered written evidence of properly given
notice by Sellers under the Contract listed in Schedule 1I(1)(b) in accordance
with the terms thereof of deletion of the Markets from such Contract.
Effective as of the Closing, Sellers shall have deleted the Markets from the
Contracts listed in Schedule 1I(1)(b), pursuant to Section 4.5 thereof.

  

  

Section 5.24 USF Approvals. If, and to the extent, (i) the USF Approvals are
obtained prior to Closing and (ii) Purchaser elects to accept the USF Assets
and assume the USF Liabilities by delivering written notice to Sellers prior
to Closing, the Transferred Assets shall include the USF Assets (for the
avoidance of doubt, the calculation of Working Capital shall not include the
USF Assets) and the Assumed Liabilities shall include the USF Liabilities. To
the extent the USF Approvals are not obtained prior to Closing or to the
extent Purchaser elects not to accept the USF Assets and assume the USF
Liabilities by delivering notice to Sellers prior to Closing, Purchaser shall
reimburse Sellers at the Closing an amount equal to any Performance Default
Payment (as that term is used in paragraphs 189-192 of Mobility Fund Phase I
Auction Scheduled for September 27, 2012; Notice and Filing Requirements and
Other Procedures for Auction 901, AU Docket No. 12-25, Public Notice, DA
12-641 (released May 2, 2012) that Sellers are required to pay to any
Governmental Authority following payment thereof by the Sellers; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall not be required to reimburse Sellers for any
Auction Default Payment (as that term is used in paragraphs 184-188 of
Mobility Fund Phase I Auction Scheduled for September 27, 2012; Notice and
Filing Requirements and Other Procedures for Auction 901, AU Docket No. 12-25,
Public Notice, DA 12-641 (released May 2, 2012)). If and to the extent
Purchaser has elected to accept the USF Assets and assume the USF Liabilities
pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 5.24, Sellers
may elect to cancel such acceptance and assumption by delivering written
notice to Purchaser prior to Closing, subject to receipt prior to Closing of
the written approvals required by any Governmental Authority to effect such
cancellation and confirm that Purchaser has not assumed any USF Liabilities;
provided that (a) such election by Sellers would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) Sellers reimburse Purchaser for the
amount equal to any Performance Payment Default described in the second
sentence of this Section 5.24 and imposed on Purchaser. If Sellers' election
pursuant to the preceding sentence satisfies all of the conditions described
in the preceding sentence, Purchaser will be deemed not to have assumed any
USF Liabilities for the purposes of the definition of "Adverse Network
Condition."

to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the confidentiality
obligations in Section 5.9 of this Agreement.

TAX MATTERS

  

  

Section 6.1 Tax Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from and against any Losses with respect to any liability for Taxes
(other than Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 6.2) imposed on or otherwise
relating to the Transferred Assets, the Partnerships and Transferred LLCs (i)
attributable to any taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date
(a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") or any portion of any taxable period that is not
a Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date, (including under
Treasury Regulation Section 1502-6 or any similar rule of foreign, federal,
state or local law, or as a tranferee, successor or otherwise), or (ii) in
connection with a breach of any representation with respect to Taxes in
Section 3.11. Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses arising in connection with a
technical termination of any Partnership within the meaning of Section 708 of
the Code due to the transfer of Partnership Interests pursuant to this
Agreement, whether under the terms of the agreement of such Partnership or
otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 61 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties
from and against any liability for Taxes relating to the Transferred Assets,
the Partnerships and the Transferred LLCs and attributable to any taxable
period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except for any portion of such
taxable period that ends on the Closing Date. Any claim to be made pursuant to
this Section 6.1 must be made before the expiration (with valid extensions) of
the applicable statute of limitations plus thirty (30) days related to the
Taxes at issue.

  

  

(c) Any payment made pursuant to this Section 6.l shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by law.

  

  

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.1, except as provided in the Transition
Services Agreement, any Tax liability attributable to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") shall be
apportioned between the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and
the portion beginning on the day after the Closing Date (x) in the case of
real and personal property Taxes, by apportioning such Taxes on a per diem
basis and (y) in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of a "closing of
the books" as of the end of the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Sellers shall be responsible for preparing any Tax Returns with respect to
the Transferred Assets, the Partnerships and the Transferred LLCs (in the case
of the Partnerships, to the extent Sellers have the direct or indirect right
to do so under the terms of the agreement of such Partnerships) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods. Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing any Tax
Returns with respect to the Transferred Assets, the Partnerships and
Transferred LLCs (in the case of the Partnerships, to the extent Purchaser has
the direct or indirect right to do so under the terms of the agreement of such
Partnerships) for Straddle Periods. Purchaser shall make such Tax Returns
available for review by Sellers in advance of the due date for filing such Tax
Returns and shall consider in good faith any change reasonably requested by
Sellers to such Tax Returns. In the event of any disagreement between
Purchaser and Sellers, such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting
firm of international reputation mutually agreeable to Purchaser and Sellers
(the "Accountant") and any such determination by the Accountant shall be
final. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Sellers.

  

  

(f) A party (the "first party") shall promptly notify the other party (the
"second party") in writing upon receipt of notice of any Tax audits,
examinations or assessments that may give rise to a liability for which the
second party is responsible under Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b),
respectively; provided, that a failure to provide notice shall not affect the
first party's rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that
the second party is materially prejudiced thereby. Sellers shall control any
such audit, examination or proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the parties shall share control over any such audit, examination or
proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period; provided that Purchaser shall be
entitled to participate in any such contest with its own counsel at its own
expense, and Sellers shall provide Purchaser with reasonable advance notice of
all communications with any Tax authority, and with advance copies of all
materials to be submitted to any Tax authority (and shall provide Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such materials), and shall
otherwise cooperate with Purchaser in good faith in connection with the
conduct of any such contest. Purchaser shall control any audit, examination or
proceeding that does not relate to Taxes for which Sellers may be responsible
under Section 6.1(a). Neither party shall settle or resolve any Tax liability
in a manner that could adversely affect the other party without the other
party's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 62 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(g) Sellers and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to) (i) provide the other party and its Affiliates with such assistance as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return
or any audit or other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Transferred
Assets; and (ii) retain (and provide the other party and its Affiliates with
reasonable access to) all records or information which may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding; provided that the foregoing
shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the parties.

  

  

Section 6.2 Transfer Taxes. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall each bear one half of the expense of all use, sales,
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and other similar
transaction Taxes, if any, imposed by reason of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). Purchaser shall be responsible for
preparing and timely filing any Tax Returns required with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate to
structure the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner that
will minimize the amount of any such Taxes.

  

  

Section 6.3 Like-Kind Exchange. In the event that either Sellers or Purchaser
desires to structure the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a
like-kind exchange, including with a third party, under Section 1031 of the
Code, the parties shall cooperate to structure such transactions as such to
the greatest extent possible under the Tax Law and shall make such
modifications to this Agreement as are reasonably necessary to meet the
requirements of Section 1031 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder; provided that nothing in this Section 6.3 will limit
either party's ability to settle or compromise any tax dispute with a tax
authority in such manner as that party determines to be appropriate. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations or
other agreements of the parties hereunder shall be affected by the structuring
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a like-kind exchange
pursuant to this Section 6.3. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be required
to make any representations or warranties, assume any obligations, spend any
out-of-pocket sum, or acquire title to any other property in connection with
the structuring of the transactions as a like-kind exchange. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 6.3
shall survive the Closing without limitation. In the event of any conflict
between this Section 6.3 and the terms and conditions of any agreement
relating to a particular transaction intended to be used as a part of a like-
kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, the terms and conditions of such
other agreement shall control to the extent of any such conflict.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 63 -  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 6.4 Survival, Coordination. Any indemnification with respect to Losses
covered by this Article VI shall not be subject to the limitations on
indemnification in Section 8.2(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the provisions of this Article VI shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

Section 8.2 Indemnification by Sellers.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 8.2(b), Sellers hereby agree that from and after the
Closing, they shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
representatives and employees (other than the Transferred Employees) and their
heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their capacity as such (the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect of any damages,
losses, Taxes, charges, Liabilities, claims, actions, suits, proceedings,
judgments, settlements, assessments, penalties, and costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and out of pocket disbursements), in
each case excluding consequential, special, incidental, indirect, punitive or
exemplary damages (except to the extent actually paid to a third party)
(collectively, "Losses") imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or
asserted against, any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, whether in respect
of third party claims, claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise,
arising out of (i) subject to Section 8.2(b), any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by Sellers, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Sellers, (iii) any appraisal or other claims of stockholders of
Sellers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iv) the Alternative Agreements, including the Alternative Agreement
Obligations, or (v) the Excluded Liabilities and all other Liabilities of
Sellers and their Affiliates that are not Assumed Liabilities. For the
purposes of this Article VIII, in determining whether there has been a breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in this Agreement and
the amount of any Losses in respect of any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties, any qualification or limitation as to
materiality (whether by reference to Material Adverse Effect or otherwise)
contained in such representation or warranty (but not in any defined term,
other than "Material Adverse Effect," used in any such representation or
warranty) shall be disregarded.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 66 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Except with respect to items indemnified or indemnifiable pursuant to
Article VI, Sellers shall not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for any Losses with respect to the matters contained in Section 8.2(a)(i)
unless (x) for any particular Loss or group of related Losses arising out of
substantially similar facts, such Loss exceeds $10,000 (such Loss of $10,000
or less being a "De Minimis Loss"), and no claim for a De Minimis Loss shall
be asserted under this Section 8.2 (and no such De Minimis Loss shall be
included in the calculation of the Threshold Amount provided for in clause (y)
hereof) and (y) the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by all Purchaser
Indemnified Parties exceeds an amount equal to $11,700,000 (the "Threshold
Amount"), in which event Sellers shall be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount. Sellers' cumulative
aggregate liability for Losses with respect to the matters contained in
Section 8.2(a)(i) shall not exceed an amount equal to $117,000,000 (the
"Indemnification Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties without application of the Indemnification
Cap or clause (y) above, including whether all Losses have exceeded the
Threshold Amount, with respect to any Loss resulting from or relating to any
alleged or actual breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made
by Sellers or any of their Affiliates pursuant to Section 3.9 with respect to
the FCC Licenses, the third sentence of Section 3.6 or Section 3.18(e), and
any payment made to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of such
Losses shall not be counted in determining if the Threshold Amount has been
satisfied or the Indemnification Cap has been reached.

  

  

Section 8.3 Indemnification by Purchaser.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 8.3(b), Purchaser hereby agrees that from and after the
Closing, it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers, their
Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, shareholders, partners,
members, attorneys, accountants, agents, representatives and employees and
their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their capacity as such
(the "Seller Indemnified Parties" and, collectively with the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect
of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted
against, any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of third
party claims, claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise, arising out of
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser, (ii) any
breach of a covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or
(iii) any Assumed Liabilities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 67 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
Losses with respect to the matters contained in Section 8.3(a)(i) (x) for any
De Minimis Loss, and no claim for a De Minimis Loss shall be asserted under
this Section 8.3 (and no such De Minimis Loss shall be included in the
calculation of the Threshold Amount provided for in clause (y) hereof) and (y)
the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by all Seller Indemnified Parties
exceeds the Threshold Amount, in which event Purchaser shall be liable to the
Seller Indemnified Parties for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount.
Purchaser's cumulative aggregate liability for Losses with respect to the
matters contained in Section 8.3(a)(i) shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Indemnification Cap.

  

  

Section 8.4 Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures. If an
indemnification claim made by any Indemnified Party under this Article VIII
involves a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party
shall (a) promptly notify the indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party") of
all relevant information concerning the Third Party Claim known to such
Indemnified Party (provided that failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
will only relieve the indemnification obligation if and to the extent such
failure results in material prejudice with respect to such Third Party Claim)
and (b) give the Indemnifying Party full opportunity to control the defense of
such Third Party Claim (using counsel reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Party); provided that the Indemnified Party can participate in any
proceeding to defend such Third Party Claim, represented by counsel of its
choosing, at its own cost and expense unless the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party are both named as parties to the proceedings and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them, in which event the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to employ one counsel to represent it. If, after notice thereof,
the Indemnifying Party fails to promptly assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim for which indemnification is claimed hereunder (but in any event within
thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party), or, after having assumed defense of such claim, fails to
diligently conduct such defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense
thereof, and shall be indemnified for the cost and expense of such defense (to
the extent such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder).
If the Indemnified Party shall have employed counsel as described in the
foregoing sentences, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
included in the calculation of Losses with respect to the Third Party Claim.
No Indemnified Party may be bound by any compromise or settlement of a Third
Party Claim without its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) unless (i) the sole relief is monetary damages for which the
Indemnified Party shall be fully indemnified, and (ii) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Law or rights of any person or entity. The
Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such compromise or settlement (A)
does result in any indemnifiable Losses or (B) fully releases the Indemnifying
Party of any Liability under this Article VIII.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 68 -  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 8.5 Adjustments to Losses.

  

  

(a) Taxes. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this Article VIII shall be reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit,
if any, actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
attributable to such Losses with respect to the year in which such Losses
arose. If the amount of any Loss with respect to any indemnification claim is
required to be reduced under this Section 8.5(a) after the Indemnifying Party
has made payment to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the Indemnifying Party cash in an amount
equal to such reduction.

  

  

(b) Insurance. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted.

  

  

(c) Reimbursement. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of Loss.

  

  

Section 8.6 Payments. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.6, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this Article VIII
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, promptly following receipt
from such Indemnified Party of a bill for a Loss that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith
reasonably disputes the Loss (or its obligation to provide indemnification
with respect thereto), in which event it shall so notify the Seller
Indemnified Party. In any event, other than in respect of amounts to be
satisfied through disbursements by the Escrow Agent which shall be paid in
accordance with Section 2.4, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount
of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than five (5) days
following any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Party's
liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (a) the parties
to the dispute have reached an agreement, (b) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final non-appealable order or judgment or
(c) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable
determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit
thereto. If the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, then such
payment shall be satisfied first from the Escrow Funds until the funds
contained therein are exhausted or released, and second, by Purchaser's right
to seek recourse directly against Sellers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 69 -  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 8.7 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made by
an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant
to Section 8.2 or 8.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by Law.

  

  

Section 8.8 Effect of Waiver of Condition. Neither Purchaser's nor Sellers'
right to indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII shall be adversely affected
by its waiver of a condition to closing set forth in Article VII unless such
party makes clear by the terms of its waiver that it is foreclosing its right
to indemnity with respect to the matter that is the subject of the waiver.

  

  

Section 8.9 No Double Recovery. Notwithstanding the fact that any Person may
have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of
more than one provision of this Agreement (including under Section 6.1 and
this Article VIII) with respect to any fact, event, condition or circumstance,
no Person will be entitled to recover the amount of any Losses suffered by
such Person more than once under this Agreement (including under Section 6.1
and this Article VIII) in respect of such fact, event, condition or
circumstance.

  

  

Section 8.10 Exclusive Remedy. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
Section 5.6(b) and Section 10.5 the parties acknowledge and agree that their
respective sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages after the Closing
for any breach of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VIII (except that no such limitation
shall apply to tort claims under applicable Law based on fraud, and this
limitation shall not affect Purchaser's rights to seek equitable remedies);
provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII, any
indemnification in respect of Taxes (including an indemnification in respect
of a breach of any representation with respect to Taxes in Section 3.11) shall
be dealt with in Section 6.1 and not in this Article VIII.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

7.3(c) and (y)(1) cannot be or is not cured prior to the date that is eighteen
(18) months after the execution of this Agreement or (2) is not cured within

Section 9.1(d)(i) and the basis for such termination; or

  

  

(ii) a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of the termination.

Agreement prior to the Closing by any party, except as otherwise provided in
this Section 9.2, all rights and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate without any liability of any party to any other

Agreement) and the provisions of Article I, this Article IX and Sections 5.9
(Confidentiality), 5.24(b) (USF Approvals), 10.1 (Governing Law; Submission to
Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial), 10.2 (Counterparts), 10.4 (Notices) and

GENERAL

  

  

Section 10.1 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

any other jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) The parties agree that the courts of the State of New York sitting in New
York County and the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, and any appellate courts from any thereof shall have exclusive

Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts the resolution of any such claim
or dispute.

  

  

(c) The parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought in
any court specified in Section 10.1(b) above, or any defense of inconvenient
forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  

  

(d) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives all
rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether

the parties in the negotiation, administration or enforcement thereof.

Section 10.5 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, would be irreparably damaged if
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by the other parties hereto
in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement
by a party could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary
damages alone. Accordingly, Purchaser (in the event of such a breach by
Sellers) or Sellers (in the event of such a breach by Purchaser) shall be
entitled to a decree of specific performance pursuant to which Sellers or
Purchaser, respectively, are ordered to affirmatively carry out their
obligations under this Agreement, whether before or after the Closing, and
each party hereto hereby waives any defense to the effect that a remedy at law
would be an adequate remedy for such breach. Any requirements for the securing
or posting of any bond by a party hereto with such equitable remedy are hereby
waived. Prior to the Closing, the foregoing shall not be deemed to be or
construed as a waiver or election of remedies by any party hereto, which
expressly reserves any and all rights and remedies available to it at law or
in equity in the event of any breach or default by Sellers or Purchaser, as
applicable, under this Agreement prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 73 -  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 10.6 Miscellaneous.

  

  

(a) Amendment; Waiver; Severability; Entire Agreement. No amendment,
modification or discharge of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless
set forth in writing and duly executed by both parties, and no waiver
hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly
executed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought. Any
such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by
any of the parties of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, on one or more occasion, shall not be construed as a waiver of
any other breach or default of a similar nature, and the failure by any of the
parties, on one or more occasion, to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder shall not be
construed as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges
hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is
exclusive of any other, except as expressly provided herein. In the event that
any one or more of the terms or provisions contained herein shall for any
reason be held to be unenforceable in any respect under Law, such
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and
the parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon an
enforceable provision which most closely approximates the intent of the
parties in entering into this Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Schedules and Exhibits, the Transition Services Agreement and the Non-
Disclosure Agreement contain the entire agreement and understanding between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.

  

  

(b) Expenses. Except as set forth in Sections 2.7(f) (Purchase Price
Adjustment), 5.2 (Filings), 5.24(b) (USF Approvals), 6.1(f) (Tax
Indemnification), 6.2 (Transfer Taxes) and 8.6 (Payments) and except as may
otherwise be agreed in writing by the parties, all legal and other costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses.

  

  

(c) Third Parties. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the parties and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors
and assigns and they shall not be construed as conferring any rights or
remedies on any other Persons.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 74 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither party
may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party; provided that Purchaser may, without the consent of Sellers, but
subject to any necessary approval from a Governmental Authority, assign this
Agreement or any rights hereunder to any of its Affiliate prior to or after
the Closing if such assignment is not reasonably likely to delay Closing, but
no assignment described in this sentence shall relieve the assignor of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(e) Headings; Interpretation. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for
convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Sellers Disclosure Letter Any item disclosed by Sellers in any Section of
the Sellers Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed for the purposes
of and shall qualify each representation and warranty to which such item or
its contents would be readily understood to relate without regard to whether
the Section specifically references such representation or warranty and
without regard to whether such representation and warranty specifically
references a Section of the Sellers Disclosure Letter. No disclosure on the
Sellers Disclosure Letter shall be deemed an admission as to the materiality
of any item so disclosed.
