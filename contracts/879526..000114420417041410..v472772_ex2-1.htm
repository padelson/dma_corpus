---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.3 _Bylaws_.

  



  

The Company shall take all requisite action so that the Bylaws of Merger

3.4 _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all requisite action so
that the directors and officers of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the

accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL.

  



  

3.5 _Additional Actions_.

  



  

If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in
Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right,
title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of
the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:

  



  

(a) each Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and each issued and
outstanding Share owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled automatically and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no payment or consideration shall be made with respect
thereto;

  



  

(b) each issued and outstanding Share other than (i) Shares referred
to in _Section 3.6(a)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer
Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest; and

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) each share of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the Shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

3.7 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company to act as disbursing agent (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") for the
payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of (i) certificates
representing the Shares or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "). Parent
will enter into a disbursing agent agreement with the Disbursing Agent, and
at such times, and from time to time, as the Disbursing Agent requires funds
to make the payments pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to make the payments pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_ to holders of
Shares (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). For purposes of determining the amount to be so deposited, Merger
Subsidiary shall assume that no stockholder of the Company will perfect any
right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. The Disbursing Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such investments
shall be (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, or
(iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation; provided further that no
loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares
pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under _Section 3.6(b)_ shall be promptly paid
to Parent. Parent shall promptly replenish the Exchange Fund to the extent of
any investment losses. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

  



  

(b) Merger Subsidiary shall instruct the Disbursing Agent to mail
promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than the fifth (5th)
Business Day thereafter, to each Person who was a record holder as of the
Effective Time of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or Book-Entry Shares, and whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_, a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Disbursing Agent for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Disbursing Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, less any required withholding of Taxes, and
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

  



  

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 3.7_, all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares (other
than Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent, Shares held by the
Company and Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes, from and
after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration
of transfers of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable
Law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Article III_. At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Disbursing Agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand by Parent. At any time
more than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent
shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made
available to the Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in exchange for
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter,
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest,
upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law.

3.8 _Company Stock Options and Other Payments_.

  



  

(a) The Company represents and warrants that there are no
outstanding options, warrants or other rights to acquire Shares granted
under any Company Stock Plan or any other agreement.

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to the Acceptance Date (i) each Company
Restricted Share shall vest in full and (ii) subject to the ultimate vesting
of such Company Restricted Shares, the holder thereof shall have the right to
tender (or to direct the Company to tender on his or her behalf) such Company
Restricted Shares then held (net of any Shares withheld to satisfy employment
and income Tax obligations) into the Offer. To the extent any Shares that
were formerly Company Restricted Shares are not so tendered, upon the
Acceptance Date, they shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 3.8(b)_ to the holder of any Company Restricted Share shall be
reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (ii) any other applicable Laws.

  



  

3.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this _Section 3.9_ ), Shares that are
held by any record holder immediately prior to the Effective Time who has
demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be canceled and terminated and shall
cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting Shares other than
such rights to be paid fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares as
are granted pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that any
holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have
withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each
case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration, without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 3.9_, if the Merger is terminated,
rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair
value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving
Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with
respect to holders of Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, any withdrawals of such
demands received by the Company and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

  



  

3.10 _Adjustments_.

  



  

If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as
the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.11 _Withholding Rights_.

  



  

Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Disbursing Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article III_
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

  



  

3.12 _Lost Certificates_.

  



  

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Disbursing Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article III_.

  



  

Article IV.

  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

  



  

Except as set forth in (x) the corresponding sections of the Company's
Disclosure Letter, it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section
of the Company's Disclosure Letter (whether or not an explicit cross
reference appears) shall be deemed to be disclosure with respect to any
other section of the Company's Disclosure Letter and any other representation
or warranty made elsewhere in _Article IV_ , in either case, to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure
or (y) the Company SEC Reports filed since January 1, 2017 (other than any

properties and carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or properties owned, operated
or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to have such power or authority, or the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



    

 | 24|

(c) Assuming that the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary contained in _Section 5.9_ are true and correct,
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares

Assuming that the Authorizations, approvals, filings and notifications
described in _Section 4.5_ have been obtained or made, except as set forth in
_Section 4.6_ of the Company's Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery
by the Company of this Agreement does not and consummation of the

who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls. The Company

and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic

officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
to be included in the Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act.

pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an

ERISA, the Company has prepared in good faith and filed all requisite
governmental reports, including any required audit reports, and has filed and

Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or with respect to any such Company
Benefit Plan, including any audit, investigation or inquiry by the IRS, the

modify, change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect
to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code or
made in connection with open enrollment periods in the ordinary course of
business, and there has been no amendment to, or modification of, or written
interpretation or announcement by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
regarding any Company Benefit Plan that would materially increase the expense
of maintaining such Company Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to such Company Benefit Plan as reflected in the financial
statements included in the SEC Reports for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2016.

Plan within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code in respect of which
the Company or any Subsidiaries of the Company has any liability.

Article V.

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBSIDIARY

  



  

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the Parent's Disclosure
Letter, it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the
Parent's Disclosure Letter (whether or not an explicit cross reference
appears) shall be deemed to be disclosure with respect to any other section
of the Parent's Disclosure Letter and any other representation or warranty
made elsewhere in _Article V_ , in either case, to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure, each of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that:

  



  

5.1 _Organization_.

  



  

(a) Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or properties owned,
operated or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to have such power or authority, or the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, would not
materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken as a
whole, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Merger Subsidiary has not
engaged and will not engage in any activities other than in connection with
or as contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent owns all of the outstanding Equity Securities of Merger
Subsidiary. The copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger
Subsidiary that have been provided or made available to the Company are
complete and correct and in full force and effect.

  



    

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.2 _Authorization_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and consummation by each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
respectively, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Subsidiary are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Subsidiary and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other party hereto)
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, enforceable against Parent and Merger Subsidiary in accordance
with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other Laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by legal
principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable
remedies.

  



  

(b) No vote of the holders of securities (equity or otherwise) of
Parent is necessary to consummate the Merger.

  



  

5.3 _Approvals_.

  



  

Assuming that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Section 4.5_ are true and correct, and assuming that the Merger is
consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
obtain any Authorization or other approval of or from, or to make any filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or third Person, except
(a) for the applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state
securities or "blue sky" Laws, the HSR Act and the filing and recordation of
the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, (b) as set forth in
_Section 5.3_ of the Parent's Disclosure Letter and (c) such other consents,
approvals, Authorizations, permits, actions, filings or notifications, the
failure of which to be made or obtained, individually or in the aggregate,
would not materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken
as a whole, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Parent Approvals_ ").

  



    

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.4 _No Violation_.

  



  

Assuming that the Authorizations, approvals, filings and notifications
described in _Section 5.3_ have been obtained or made, the execution and
delivery by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement does not and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(a) conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or cause a default
(or an event that with notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a
default) under (i) any Law, Regulation or Order applicable to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary or (iii) the
organizational documents of Parent's Subsidiaries, or (b) conflict with,
result in any violation or breach of, or cause a default (or an event that
with notice, lapse of time or otherwise would become a default) under, or give
to others any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
of, or require a payment under, or result in the loss of any benefit under, or
in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, lease, license, permit, franchise, contract or agreement to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective properties or assets is bound, except
in the case of matters described in clauses (a)(i) and (b) of this _Section
5.4_ that, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially impair
the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.5 _Litigation_.

  



  

There are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (including any
proceedings in arbitration) pending against or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to the Knowledge of
Parent, against any present or former officer or director of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or other Person for which Parent or any Subsidiary may be
liable or to which any of their respective properties, assets or rights are
reasonably likely to be subject before any Governmental Authority that would
or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.6 _Source of Funds_.

  



  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of
an executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter from the
financial institutions identified therein (collectively, the " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ", which for purposes of _Section
6.19(b)_ and _(c)_ includes any offering of debt or equity securities, the
proceeds of which are intended to be used to satisfy the obligations under
this Agreement, as well as the consummation of amendments and supplements to
the Parent's existing debt facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter). As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment has
not been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated (other than amendments or modifications permitted by _Section
6.19(a)_ ), and none of the obligations and commitments contained in such
letters have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent
or Merger Subsidiary has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment that are payable on or prior
to the date of this Agreement. Assuming (A) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set out in _Article IV_ and the
performance of the Company's obligations hereunder and (B) the satisfaction
or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waiver of the conditions in
_Annex A_ , as of the Closing the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment, together with other available sources of cash, will in
the aggregate be sufficient for Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving
Corporation to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the
Offer, Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the Merger Consideration, the
Offer Price, amounts due under _Section 3.8_ and any fees and expenses of or
payable by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.

  



    

 | 41| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Debt Financing Commitment is (i) the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, and,
to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, each of the other parties
thereto, (ii) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary, each of the other parties thereto and (iii) in full
force and effect, subject, as to enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other Laws affecting creditors' rights generally or by legal
principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable
remedies. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
Company's representations and warranties and undertakings under this
Agreement, (A) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, any other person party to the Debt Financing
Commitment, in each case, under the Debt Financing Commitment and (B)
assuming satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of
the conditions to Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's obligation to consummate
the Offer, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary on the Acceptance Date in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Financing Commitment. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment and, after the date of this Agreement, such
other conditions and contingencies with respect to the Debt Financing
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.19(a)_. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no contracts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
(whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into agreements,
arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) to which Parent or
any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding of the full amount of
the Debt Financing other than as expressly contained in the Debt
Financing Commitment and delivered to the Company prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

  



  

5.7 _Solvency_.

  



  

After giving effect to the Offer, Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary will (i) be insolvent
(insolvency being defined as its financial condition is such that (a) the sum
of its debts is greater than the fair value of its assets or (b) the fair
salable value of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured); (ii)
have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business; or (iii)
have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to repay such debts
as they become absolute and matured.

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.8 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_.

  



  

Other than this Agreement and the Stockholder Tender and Voting Agreement, as
of the date hereof there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments,
agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
member of the Company's management or the Company's Board of Directors or any
of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company
after the Effective Time.

  



  

5.9 _Ownership_.

  



  

Except as set forth in _Section 5.9_  of the Parent's Disclosure Letter,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any Shares or other securities
convertible into Shares, including, without limitation, beneficial ownership
of any Shares or other securities convertible into Shares pursuant to Rule
13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

In entering into this Agreement and each of the other documents and
instruments relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Subsidiary have each relied solely upon its
own investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties
provided by the Company in _Article IV_ , and Parent and Merger Subsidiary
acknowledge and agree that except for the specific representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or any agreement or
certificate contemplated hereby (including any that are subject to the
Company Disclosure Documents and the Company SEC Reports), none of the
Company, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective stockholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives makes or has made any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their business, operations, technology,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, prospects,
projections, budgets, estimates or operational metrics, or as to the accuracy
or completeness of any of the information (including any statement, document
or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any financial
statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided (including in any management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum, certain "data rooms" maintained by the
Company, supplemental information or other materials or information with
respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders or
Representatives.

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and

as soon as practicable (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after
receipt of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or indication that any Person is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3_ ,
prior to the Acceptance Date, after receiving an unsolicited, bona fide,
third party proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that is
submitted to the Company by any Person (and not withdrawn), if none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Representatives of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries have breached any of the provisions set forth in this
_Section 6.3_ in any respect, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or its Board of Directors from (X) contacting such Person solely to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (Y) engaging in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or giving access to the properties, assets

Standstill Agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company's legal and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (after
consultation with the Company's legal advisor) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
directors' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Laws, and (iii) the Company (A) enters into a
confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the Confidentiality
Agreement and provides a copy of such agreement to Parent and (B)
concurrently discloses or makes available the same information to Parent as

(e) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) except as
set forth in this _Section 6.3_ , withdraw or modify or change, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify or change, in a manner adverse to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, its recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this
Agreement or (ii) except in accordance with this _Section 6.3_ , approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or other agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
_Section 6.3(d)(iv)(A)_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Date, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's legal and
financial advisors) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, or that any material event or circumstance relating to the business
prospects of the Company not known by the Board of Directors of the Company
as of the date hereof (or if known, the consequences of which are not known
or reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the
date hereof) and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal (such material
event or circumstance, or consequences thereof, an " _Intervening Event_ ")
has occurred, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify
its recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or the Agreement in response to
the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event and terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , but only if (A) the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's
legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Laws, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
provides Parent with at least four (4) Business Days' advance written notice
(provided however, that during the five (5) Business Days prior to the initial
Expiration Date, the period for notice shall be reduced to two (2) Business
Days) of its intention to make a change in recommendation and specifying the
material events giving rise thereto, and (C) during such four (4) Business Day
period (or, where applicable, a two (2) Business Day period, the " _Notice
Period_ "), the Company and its Representatives shall, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives to amend this
Agreement so as to enable the Board of Directors of the Company to proceed
with its recommendation of this Agreement (after taking into account any
agreed modifications to the terms of this Agreement) and at the end of such
Notice Period (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new Notice Period of at least three (3) Business Days (or, during
the five (5) Business Days prior to the initial Expiration Date, one (1)
Business Days), the Board of Directors of the Company maintains
its determination (after taking into account any agreed modifications to the
terms of this Agreement).

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall be permitted to disclose to the stockholders of the Company a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal required by Rule 14e-2(a),
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall first
provide Parent the notice and opportunity to negotiate an amendment to this
Agreement in the manner provided in _Section 6.3(e)(B)_ and _Section
6.3(e)(C)_ above.

with Section 251(h) of the DGCL as promptly as reasonably practicable
following consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the

6.6 _Director and Officer Liability_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and, when applicable,
the Surviving Corporation, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by Law the current and former officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
all losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties and liability in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including amounts
paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of Parent (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), by
reason of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request
of the Company as a director or officer of any other company, with respect to
any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in any such capacity,
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to an Indemnified Party
with respect to a Legal Proceeding that was commenced by Indemnified Party
unless such Legal Proceeding was authorized or consented to by the Board of
Directors of the Company. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that all rights
to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any
agreement set forth in _Section 6.6_ of the Company's Disclosure Letter, in
each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and without
amendment thereof. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any
Legal Proceeding in connection with any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder, then, unless otherwise provided for in an indemnification
agreement with such Indemnified Party, the Surviving Corporation shall
advance, to the extent consistent with the provisions of then applicable law,
as incurred any costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
disbursements of one counsel selected by the Indemnified Party), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (" _Damages_ ") arising out of
or incurred in connection with such Legal Proceeding, subject to the Surviving
Corporation's receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable
Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the
event of any such Legal Proceeding, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal Proceeding pending or
threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in
respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Legal Proceeding or the Indemnified Party otherwise consents
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent will cause, including, without limitation, by
providing any necessary funds to meet the obligations of this _Section 6.6_ ,
Merger Subsidiary to, and Surviving Corporation will, without any lapse in
coverage, provide officers' and directors' liability insurance (the " _D
andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of the Company's officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend a
total premium during such period in excess of 300% of the per annum rate of
the aggregate annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance
on the date of this Agreement; provided further that if the amount of the
total premium for such insurance shall exceed such 300%, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount; provided further that in the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
directly or indirectly, (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.6_. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid DandO Insurance policy(ies) has been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, which policy(ies) provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policy(ies) has
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause, including, without limitation, by providing
any necessary funds to meet the obligations of this _Section 6.6_ , the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such policy(ies) in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 6.6_ ,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to reimburse all expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees, incurred by any Person to enforce the obligations of
Parent and Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

(c) The obligations under this _Section 6.6_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to materially alter the
indemnification(s) provided for under this _Section 6.6_ of any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.6_ ).

  



  

6.7 _Access and Information_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, (i) afford to Parent,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives access, at reasonable
times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities and assets of the Company and to its
books, records, contracts, work papers, Tax Returns and other documents that
Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives as may be
reasonably requested and (ii) furnish promptly to Parent, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives such information concerning its
business, properties, assets, liabilities, contracts, records and personnel

however that such access shall not include the right to do any intrusive or
destructive testing including any sampling of environmental media without
the prior written consent of the Company which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(c) None of the information with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that the Company furnishes to Parent

parties contained in this _Section 6.10_ , if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Offer, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and shall use its respective reasonable best efforts

Until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may
be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the
Stock Exchange will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national

The Company shall control, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity

Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in resisting any
such effort to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose such

Prior to the Acceptance Date and to the extent permitted by Law, the Company
(acting through its Board, compensation committee or its independent
directors, to the extent required) will take all such steps as may be
required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by
the Company or its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any of the
Covered Securityholders pursuant to which compensation is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule

(a) Parent agrees that the Continuing Employees will, during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing until July 1,
2018, continue to be provided with compensation and benefits (excluding

favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (excluding
equity awards) that are generally made available to such Continuing Employees
by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) If requested in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Plan Termination Date_ "),
any Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan,
then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Plan Termination Date
written evidence of the adoption by the Board of Directors (or comparable
governing body) of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company
401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to
the prior review of Parent).

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.16_ is not
intended to and shall not (i) create any third party rights, (ii) amend any
Company Benefit Plan, (iii) require Parent to continue any Company Benefit
Plan beyond the time when it otherwise lawfully could be terminated or
modified or (iv) provide any Continuing Employee with any rights to continued
employment, severance pay or similar benefits following any termination of

reasonable best efforts to cause each issued and outstanding Company
Restricted Share granted under the Company Stock Plans to be amended to
permit the acceleration and vesting of such Company Restricted Shares
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date as provided in _Section 3.8_ hereof
to the extent such Company Restricted Shares do not permit such treatment;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Company provide any benefit or
consideration to the holder of any Company Restricted Shares in obtaining
such amendment or take any other action prohibited in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Rule 14d-10 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

  



    

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.18 _Rule 16b-3_.

  



  

Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall each take all such reasonable
steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by _Articles

executive officer of the Company or at the Effective Time will become a
director or executive officer of Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.19 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) 

  



  

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable, to consummate and obtain the Debt
Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and subject only to
the conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (or with other terms
and conditions agreed by Parent and the Financing Sources, subject to the
restrictions on amendments of the Debt Financing Commitment set forth below),
including using its reasonable best efforts to (A) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (or
with other terms and conditions agreed by Parent and the Financing Sources,
subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Debt Financing Commitment set
forth below), (B) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), and cause its Affiliates
to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), on a timely basis all conditions, and
comply with all obligations applicable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary,
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing Commitment that are within the
control of the Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of its or their Affiliates,
and (C) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment. If all conditions to
the Debt Financing have been satisfied and the conditions to Parent's and
Merger Subsidiary's obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived, each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions within
its control to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.19_ , Parent acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations to consummate the Offer on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein is not conditioned upon the availability
or consummation of the Debt Financing, the availability of any replacement
commitments or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

  



    

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall agree to or permit any
amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights
under, the Debt Financing Commitment without the Company's prior written
consent that (A) adds or modifies conditions or contingencies to the
availability of the Debt Financing relative to those contained in the Debt
Financing Commitment in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x)
delay the Closing or impair the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing
Date or (y) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur, (B) would
otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the
Closing Date, (C) adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment or (D) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment, in each case as of the date of this
Agreement by an amount that would reasonably be expected to delay the Closing
or impair the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing; provided,
however, that in the case of clause (D), to the extent that the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing is reduced pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing Commitment by virtue of obtaining alternative committed financing,
such alternative financing shall comply with the requirements set forth in
clauses (A) - (C) of this sentence, and provided, further that
notwithstanding clauses (A) - (D), Parent or Merger Subsidiary may amend,
restate, modify or supplement the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, syndication agents, lenders or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of
the date hereof, to provide for the assignment and reallocation of a portion
of the debt financing commitments contained therein and to grant customary
approval rights to such additional arrangers and other entities in connection
with such appointments, in each case, as expressly set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any amendment, modification or waiver to or under the Debt Financing
Commitment.

  



  

(iii) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of the Debt Financing and provide to the
Company copies of substantially final drafts (when available) of the material
definitive documents for the Debt Financing (subject to customary redaction
with respect to fees). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall, promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof, give the Company
written notice of any (A) breach or default by any party to the Debt Financing
Commitment and any definitive document related to the Debt Financing, (B)
actual or written threat of withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Debt
Financing Commitment or the definitive documents relating to the Debt
Financing, (C) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to the Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Debt Financing, or (D) occurrence of an event or development that could
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitment (or if at any time for any other reason Parent
or Merger Subsidiary believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment).

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall enter
into such new debt financing commitment without the consent of the Company if
the terms thereof would be reasonably expected to impair or delay or prevent
the Closing. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of
all contracts or other arrangements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant
to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any
portion of the Debt Financing. For purposes of this _Section 6.19_,
references to the "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this _Section 6.19_ and references to the "Debt
Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this _Section 6.19_.

  



  

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to pursue and enter into alternative or
substitute financing, the terms of which may differ from the terms set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment, but which will conform with  _Section
6.19(a)(ii)_ above. No actions taken by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection therewith shall
in and of itself constitute a breach of the obligations of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide, and cause
its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall request that its
Representatives provide, to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, in each case at
Parent's sole expense, such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or any replacement,
amended, modified, alternative or substitute financing permitted by this
_Section 6.19_ (each, an " _Alternative Financing_ ")). Such cooperation
shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent:

  



  

(i) reasonable cooperation with customary marketing efforts of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Debt Financing, any
Alternative Financing and any underwritten offering of debt securities,
including causing its management team, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, and external auditors to assist in preparation for and to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, in each case, upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable
dates and times prior to and during the Marketing Period;

  



  

(ii) in advance of the Marketing Period, providing reasonable assistance with
the preparation of customary rating agency presentations, road show materials,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and bank syndication materials,
offering documents, private placement memoranda and similar documents

current reports filed by the Company with the SEC) in connection with the
marketing and syndication of the Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing or
an underwritten offering of debt securities;

(iii) providing customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
within a reasonable amount of time following Parent's request, with

Subsidiaries to the extent required to consummate the Debt Financing
in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, and providing reasonable assistance to the
Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's preparation of pro forma financial
information and projections required to consummate the Debt Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment, including delivery
of the Required Information as promptly as practicable;

  



  

(v) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other
information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries as and solely to the
extent required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act;

  



  

(vi) requesting that the Company's independent accountants participate in
drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions and cooperate with the
Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing and any underwritten offering of
debt securities consistent with their customary practice,
including requesting that they provide customary comfort letters (including
"negative assurance" comfort) to the extent required in connection with the
marketing and syndication of the Debt Financing (as set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or as are
customarily required in an underwritten offering of debt securities or any
Alternative Financing;

  



  

(vii) reasonable cooperation with the Financing Sources' due diligence, to
the extent customary and reasonable;

  



  

(viii) reasonably cooperating with Parent's legal counsel in connection with
customary legal opinions required of Merger Subsidiary or Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing;

  



  

(ix) reasonably assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive agreements for the Debt Financing and other customary
financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents and other
certificates and documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, as applicable;

  



    

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(x) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Debt Financing (including
delivery of original stock certificates and original stock powers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent required on the Closing Date in
connection with the Debt Financing);

  



  

(xi) arranging for a customary payoff letter (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent) to be delivered at or prior to Closing
relating to the payoff and termination of, the Credit Agreement, duly
executed by the administrative agent, or any other holder of such
indebtedness, as applicable, and setting forth all amounts necessary to be
paid in order to fully pay off all of the amounts outstanding under the Credit
Agreement, and providing that, upon such payment, such indebtedness will be
extinguished and all Liens relating thereto will be released;

  



  

(xii) taking all ministerial company actions, subject to and only effective
upon the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, as applicable, to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing;
and

  



  

(xiii) using reasonable best efforts to permit the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Financing to benefit from the existing lending relationships of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in connection with the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, including the cooperation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives contemplated by this
_Section 6.19_, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any historical financial statements
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and except to the extent
such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arose out of or resulted from
the fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or intentional
misrepresentation of any such indemnified party. All information obtained by
the parties hereto pursuant to this  _Section 6.19_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' trademarks and logos in connection with the Debt Financing, any
Alternative Financing or any underwritten offering of debt securities;
provided, that such trademarks and logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

6.20 _Company Floor Plan Financing Arrangements_.

  



  

At Parent's request the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts, and each shall use its

and shall cooperate with Parent in all discussions and arrangements Parent
deems necessary or desirable in connection therewith, including all notices,

the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course, or (b) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees or incur any other
liability or obligation in connection therewith or be required to bear any
cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection therewith, in
each case that is not fully paid or reimbursed by Parent.

The obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate
the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

shall have been obtained or made, except for filings in connection with the
Merger and any other documents required to be filed after the Effective Time
and except where the failure to have obtained or made any such consent,
Authorization, Order, approval, filing or registration would not make the

Neither the Company nor Parent may rely, either as a basis for not
consummating the Merger or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the
Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ , as the
case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused in any material
respect by such party's breach of any provision of this Agreement or failure
to use such efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby as required by _Section 6.10_.

This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company):

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  



  

(b) by either the Company or Parent if:

of the DGCL) on or before November 6, 2017 (the " _End Date_ "); provided,
however, that if on the End Date the condition set forth in paragraph (ii) of
_Annex A_ shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to the Offer
shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied at the Expiration Date, provided,
that such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied), then the End
Date shall be extended to December 6, 2017 (provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this clause (b)(i) shall not be available to
any party whose breach or failure to fulfill any of its material obligations
under this Agreement has been the cause of the failure to consummate (as
defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer by such date); or

  



  

(ii) there shall be any applicable Law that makes consummation (as defined in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibited or if any Order of a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall restrain or prohibit the consummation (as defined
in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer or the Merger, and such Order
shall have become final and nonappealable (provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this clause (b)(ii) shall not be available to
any party who has not used its reasonable best efforts to have such Order
lifted and shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision
of this Agreement results in any applicable Law making the consummation (as
defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer or the Merger illegal or
otherwise prohibited or the imposition of any Order of a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction that restrains or prohibits the
consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer or the
Merger).

  



  

(c) by the Company if:

  



  

(i) prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have (x)
breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement or (y)
breached any of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement
in any material respect, or any such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue in any material respect, which breach or failure is either
incurable or, if curable, is not cured by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary by
the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent of written
notice of such breach or failure and (B) the End Date; provided, at the time
of the delivery of such written notice, the Company shall not be in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

  



    

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, (x) the Company has not
violated _Section 6.3_ and has complied with _Section 6.3(e)_ , (y) the
Company has received a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Board of Directors has
approved the termination of this Agreement and the Company promptly enters
into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of the Superior
Proposal; provided, that, promptly following such termination, the Company
pays the Termination Fee due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ ; or

  



  

(iii) (A) Merger Subsidiary fails to commence the Offer within five (5)
Business Days following the expiration of the period required by _Section
2.1(a)_ or terminates or makes any change to the Offer in material violation
of the terms of this Agreement or (B) at any Expiration Date, Merger
Subsidiary shall fail to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in
accordance with _Section 2.1_ and at such time as all of the conditions set
forth on _Annex A_ are satisfied or no subsequent Expiration Date is
established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer (provided that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this clause (c)(iii) shall not be
available to the Company if its breach or failure to fulfill any of its
material obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of the failure to
commence the Offer or consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL)
the Offer);

  



  

(d) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Date, if:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have breached any representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of the Company shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the condition set forth in
paragraph (iv)(b) of _Annex A_ would not be satisfied or would be incapable
of being satisfied by the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days following receipt by
the Company of written notice of such breach and (B) the End Date; provided,
that at the time of the delivery of such written notice, Parent shall not be
in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) the Company shall have breached its covenants or agreements hereunder
and any such breaches remain uncured, or are incapable of being cured, such
that the conditions set forth in paragraph (iv)(c) of _Annex A_ would not be
satisfied or would be incapable of being satisfied by the earlier of (A)
thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach and (B) the End Date; provided, that at the time of the delivery of
such written notice, Parent shall not be in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement; or

  



    

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn, modified or
changed in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, its
recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, or the Company
shall have breached in any material respect its obligations under
_Section 6.3_.

  



  

The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any Person
controlling any such party or any of their respective officers,
directors, Representatives or agents, whether prior to or after the execution
of this Agreement.

  



  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , the party
desiring to terminate shall give written notice to the other party or parties,
specifying the provisions pursuant to which termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party to the other party
hereto immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the other party;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability
or damages incurred or suffered by a party, to the extent such liabilities or
damages were the result of fraud or any Willful and Material Breach in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 8.2_,  _Section 8.3_ and _Article
IX_ shall survive any termination hereof. When used in this Agreement, the
term " _Willful and Material Breach_ " shall mean an act or a failure to act,
which act or failure to act constitutes in and of itself a material breach of
this Agreement, with the actual knowledge of the breaching party that the
taking of the act or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected
to, cause or constitute a breach of this Agreement.

  



  

8.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_ , whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

  



  

(b) In the event that:

  



  

(i) (A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company, the Board, or senior management of the Company, or shall have been
made directly to the stockholders of the Company or any Person shall have
publicly announced a bona fide intention (not subsequently withdrawn) to make
an Acquisition Proposal and (B) following the occurrence of an event described
in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ ( _Failure to close by End Date_ ),
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_  ( _Company breach of representation or warranty_ ) or
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Company breach of covenant_ ) and (C) the Company
consummates an Acquisition Proposal, within twelve (12) months of the date
this Agreement is terminated (provided that for purposes of this _Section
8.3(b)(i)_ , the references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or

  



    

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ ( _Company receipt of Superior Proposal_ ); or

  



  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(iii)_ ( _Company change in recommendation_ );

  



  

then, the Company shall pay to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated in
writing by Parent (" _Payee_ ") a termination fee of $12,751,000 in cash (the
" _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of
_Section 8.3(b)_ shall be made to Payee on the date an Acquisition
Proposal is consummated; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause
(ii) or (iii) of _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be made to Payee within two (2)
Business Days of notice of the occurrence thereof to the Company; and in each
case such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

  



  

(d) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ ( _Parent breach of representation or
covenant_ ), or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)(B)_ ( _Merger Subsidiary failure to
accept Shares_ ), then, within two (2) Business Days of notice thereof,
Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $20,037,000 in cash (the
" _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be designated by the Company.

  



  

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee or
a Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_
and _Section 8.3(d)_ are not a penalty, but rather are a reasonable amount
that will compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary, with respect to _Section
8.3(b)_, and the Company, with respect to _Section 8.3(d)_ , for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ , the parties would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_  and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ or any
portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent the Expenses incurred by the
prevailing party and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at a rate equal
to the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment. Likewise, if Parent
fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_  or any
portion thereof, Parent shall pay to the Company the Expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
such amount or portion thereof at a rate equal to the prime rate reported in
The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

(f) _Limitation on Remedies_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except (i)
for the remedy of specific performance to the extent permitted in _Section
9.11_  and (ii) with respect to liabilities or damages that were the result
of fraud or any Willful and Material Breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company's sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates and any of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents or
other Representatives, members, Financing Sources or other financing sources,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, the "
_Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages that arise out of the
failure of the transactions under this Agreement to be consummated or any
breach or failure to perform as required hereunder or otherwise, shall be to
terminate this Agreement and, to the extent and only to the extent provided
in _Section 8.3_ , to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee payable
pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ , and upon payment in full of such amounts,
neither the Company nor any other Person shall have any rights or claims
against the Parent Related Parties under or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor shall the Company or any other Person
be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding against the Parent
Related Parties arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue
both specific performance as permitted by _Section 9.11_ and the payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, (i) in no event shall the Company be entitled to
specific performance of this Agreement from and after such time as the Company
has received the Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_
and (ii) under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both
(A) a grant of specific performance pursuant to _Section 9.11_ and (B) the
Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except (i)
for the remedy of specific performance to the extent permitted under _Section
9.11_ and (ii) with respect to liabilities or damages that were the result of
fraud or any Willful and Material Breach on the part of the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Company and its respective Affiliates and any of its respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents or other
Representatives, members, or other financing sources, managers, general or
limited partners or assignees (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_
") for all losses and damages that arise out of the failure of the
transactions under this Agreement to be consummated or any breach or failure
to perform as required hereunder or otherwise shall be to terminate this
Agreement and, to the extent and only to the extent provided in _Section 8.3_
, to receive payment of the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_, and upon payment in full of such amounts, neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary nor any other Person shall have any rights or claims against the
Company Related Parties under or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any
other Person be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding
against the Company Related Parties arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and
Merger Subsidiary may pursue both specific performance (as permitted by
_Section 9.11_ ) and the payment of the Termination Fee, (i) in no event shall
Parent be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement from and after
such time as Parent has received the Termination Fee payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_ and (ii) under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger
Subsidiary be entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance
pursuant to _Section 9.11_ and (B) the Termination Fee payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_.

in respect of, or in any way relating to:

  



  

(i) the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the

matters ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the " _Covered Matters_ "),

  



    

 | 72| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

and hereby waive, and agree not to assert as a defense in any Legal
Proceeding with regard to or involving a Covered Matter, that such Legal
Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said Courts or that
venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such Courts, and the parties hereto, on
their behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, irrevocably agree
that all claims with respect to such Legal Proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively by such a Delaware state or federal Court. The parties
hereto, on their behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, hereby
consent to and grant any such Court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with such Legal Proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section 9.1_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the parties hereto agrees that (I) it will not bring or support or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support, any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in applicable Law or in equity, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the transactions contemplated hereby or the Debt
Financing Commitment or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under

United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof) and (II) solely for purposes of any such action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim referred to in
clause (I), this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws and judicial decisions of the State of New York
applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely within such state,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  



  

(c) In addition, by entering into this Agreement, each party hereto,
on its behalf and, to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, on
behalf of its respective equityholders, partners, members, directors,
Affiliates, officers or agents, as the case may be, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges, that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding (regardless of the
legal theory or claim involved or the procedural nature of any such Legal
Proceeding) with regard to any Covered Matter against any Covered Party, other
than the parties hereto.

  



  

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement, (ii) any breach of this _Section
9.5_ would result in irreparable harm and that monetary damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any such breach and (iii) that any breach of this
_Section 9.5_ will be deemed a material breach of this
Agreement. Accordingly, each Covered Party shall be entitled to equitable
relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any
such breach by a party (or any affiliate of such party) and in case of any
such breach, the non-breaching party shall be excused from its performance
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

For the purposes of this _Section 9.5_ , " _Covered Party_ " shall mean (i)
any party hereto, (ii) any such parties' officers, directors,
agents, employees, or Affiliates or (iii) any officer, director, agent, or
employee of any such Person, all of whom are intended third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 9.5_.

  



  

9.6 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_.

  



  

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by
facsimile or electronic transmission in portable document format), each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto.

This Agreement, the Company's Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings
and negotiations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, inducement, promise,
understanding, condition or warranty not set forth herein has been made or
relied upon by either party hereto. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder except for the provisions of _Section
6.6_, which are intended for the benefit of the Company's former and present
officers and directors, _Section 9.5_ , which is intended for the benefit of
the Covered Parties and _Sections 8.3_ , _9.3_ , _9.5_ , _9.7_ and _9.10_
, which are intended for the benefit of the Financing Sources. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including pursuant to
_Sections 6.6_ , _9.5(c)_ and _9.11_ hereof), this Agreement may be enforced
only against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement may be made only against the entities that are
expressly identified as parties hereto and no past, present or future
Affiliate, director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager,
partner, equityholder, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any claim related to tort or contract
theories of Law.

  



  

9.8 _Headings_.

  



  

The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

9.9 _Severability_.

  



  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party.

9.11 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof on a timely basis or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the provisions of this _Section
9.11_, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in the Federal Court of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), without proof of
actual damages or otherwise. This right is in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity. This right shall include the right of the Company to cause
Parent and Merger Subsidiary to cause the Offer, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms
and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. If,
prior to the End Date, any party brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time
during which such Legal Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days
or (y) such other time period established by the Delaware Court presiding over
such Legal Proceeding.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the avoidance of
doubt, while Parent and Merger Subsidiary may concurrently seek specific
performance or other equitable relief and monetary damages under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to
effect the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the
Offer or the Merger and a payment of monetary damages, including the
Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the avoidance
of doubt, while the Company may concurrently seek specific performance or
other equitable relief and monetary damage, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of a specific
performance or other equitable relief to effect the consummation (as defined
in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer or the Merger and payment of
monetary damages including the Parent Termination Fee.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be entitled
to specific performance of this Agreement from and after such time as Parent
has (i) terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and (ii)
received the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to specific
performance of this Agreement from and after such time as the Company has
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ and received the
Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_.

  



  

(d) The right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger and each
party hereto hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.11_.
Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such Order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 9.11_.

9.12 _Limitations on Warranties_.

  



  

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Company's Disclosure Letter and any agreements or certificates
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company makes no other express or
implied representation or warranty to Parent or Merger Subsidiary. Parent and
Merger Subsidiary each acknowledge that, in entering into this Agreement, it
has not relied on any representations or warranties of the Company other than
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement, the Company's Disclosure Letter or any agreements or
certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and any agreements or certificates delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Subsidiary make no other express or implied
representation or warranty to the Company. The Company acknowledges that, in
entering into this Agreement, it has not relied on any representations or
warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary other than the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement or any
agreements or certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

9.13 _Provisions Related to Financing Sources_.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates that neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates shall have any claim, whether at law, or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, or seek to enforce this
Agreement against any Financing Source or any lender participating in the
Debt Financing, and that none of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability or obligation to the Company or its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
(including the Debt Financing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (a) no amendment or modification to this _Section 9.13_ (or
amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions as they
affect this _Section 9.13_ ) shall be effective without the prior written
consent of each Financing Source and (b) _Section 8.3_ ,  _Section 9.3_ ,
_Section 9.5_ , _Section 9.7_ , _Section 9.10_ and this _Section 9.13_ are
intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Company.

 _ANNEX A_

  



  

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

  



  

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
to which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to Merger Subsidiary's right to extend and amend the Offer pursuant
to the provisions of the Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall not be required
to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Subsidiary to)
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and Regulations of the
SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, if any one or more
of the following conditions shall not have been satisfied:

  



  

(i) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of
Shares, which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, taken as a whole (but excluding Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received," as such
term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer
pursuant to such procedures), constitutes at least one Share more than one-
half (1/2) of all Shares outstanding as of the consummation of the Offer (as
such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) (the " _Minimum Tender
Condition_ ");

  



  

(ii) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, if any, shall have expired or
been terminated;

  



  

(iii) the Marketing Period shall have been completed (the "
_Marketing Period Condition_ "); and

  



  

(iv) none of the following events shall have occurred and be
continuing at any time after the date of this Agreement and immediately
before expiration of the Offer:

  



  

(a) any Order, decree, injunction or ruling restraining or enjoining
or otherwise materially delaying or preventing the acceptance for payment of,
or the payment for, some or all of the Shares or otherwise prohibiting
consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer shall
have been issued by a Governmental Authority or any statute, rule or
Regulation shall have been enacted that prohibits or makes illegal the
acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, some or all of the Shares;

  



    

 | A-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Section 4.3_ , _Section 4.4(a)_ or _Section 4.7_ , without giving effect
to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications, shall not
be true and correct in all material respects at and as of immediately prior
to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than
such representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only
as of another specified time, which shall be true and correct in all material
respects only as of such time), except that the representation and warranty
set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.3(b)_ shall be true and correct
other than any de minimis inaccuracies and (B) all of the
remaining representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement, without giving effect to materiality or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications shall not be true and correct at and as of immediately
prior to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other
than such representations and warranties that by their terms address
matters only as of another specified time, which shall be true and correct
only as of such time) except, with respect to this clause (B), where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(c) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its covenants or obligations to be performed
or complied with by it under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date;

  



  

(d) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate
signed by an executive officer of the Company dated as of the date on which
the Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in the foregoing
clauses (b) and (c) do not exist;

  



  

(e) since the date of the Agreement, any fact(s), circumstance(s),
event(s), change(s), effect(s) or occurrence(s) shall have occurred,
which has or have had, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; or

  



  

(f) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

The conditions set forth in this _Annex A_ are for the benefit of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary and, regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, except that the
conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any Governmental
Authority may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of
Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Tender Condition which may
not be waived without the prior written consent of the Company) may be waived
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in its discretion in whole or in part at any
applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and
conditions of the Agreement and the applicable rules and Regulations of
the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.
