(the " _Estimated Valuation Date Accounting Statement_ ") setting forth CTIÂ’s

the assets and liabilities of the Business as of the Valuation Date
anticipated, based on the most recent available financial information, to be
reflected on the Valuation Date prepared in accordance with Agreed Accounting
Principles. The Estimated Valuation Date Accounting Statement shall
be certified by CTIÂ’s chief financial officer. The Purchase Price shall

15 Section 3.3. _Valuation Date Statement and Actual Purchase Price_.



(a) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, CTI shall
(i) prepare in accordance with Agreed Accounting Principles, a statement of
assets and liabilities as of the Valuation Date (the " _Preliminary Valuation
Date Statement_ "), (ii) determine the Purchase Price in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement (the " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ "), the
Inventory Valuation Amount, the Sloan-Kettering Royalty Amount and the
Valuation Date Working Capital Amount, and (iii) deliver to Purchaser the
Preliminary Valuation Date Statement and a certificate of CTIÂ’s chief
financial officer setting forth the Preliminary Purchase Price, the Inventory
Valuation Amount, the Sloan-Kettering Royalty Amount and the Valuation Date
Working Capital Amount (the " _Preliminary Accounting Statement_ ").
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and its accountants to the extent
reasonably required to enable CTI to prepare the Preliminary Accounting
Statement in accordance with this Agreement. 



(b) Purchaser may dispute one or more of the items set forth in the
Preliminary Accounting Statement by notifying CTI in writing within forty-five
(45) days after its receipt of the Preliminary Accounting Statement thereof,
but only on the basis that such item was not prepared in accordance with the
Agreed Accounting Principles or is mathematically inaccurate. During such
45-day period, and until the Valuation Date Statement and the Purchase Price
are finally determined, employees of Purchaser and its accountants shall be
entitled to access to CTIÂ’s and its accountantsÂ’ work papers prepared in
connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Accounting Statement and
shall be entitled to review and discuss such work papers with CTI and its
accountants. Any notice delivered in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_ shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. If
Purchaser does not so notify CTI within such period, the Preliminary Valuation
Date Statement and the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties as the " _Valuation Date Statement_ " and the
Purchase Price, respectively. If Purchaser does so notify CTI, Purchaser and
CTI and their respective accountants shall attempt to resolve by written
agreement (" _Agreed Adjustments_ ") any differences as to the Preliminary
Accounting Statement and, in the event CTI and Purchaser so resolve such
differences, the Preliminary Valuation Date Statement and the Purchase Price
set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Statement as adjusted by the Agreed
Adjustments shall be final and binding as the Valuation Date Statement and the
Purchase Price, respectively, but shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement (except to the extent any Damages related to
a breach of such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements would be
duplicative of amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ ).



(c) If Purchaser and CTI are unable to reach a resolution with respect to all
of the items specified in a notice provided pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_
within twenty (20) days after receipt by CTI of such notice, then either party
may submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to Deloitte and
Touche, LLP (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), which shall, within
twenty (20) days after such submission or such longer period as the
Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably require, determine and report to
Purchaser and CTI upon such remaining disputed items (based solely on the
presentations of Purchaser and CTI as to whether any disputed matter has been
determined in a manner consistent with Agreed Accounting Principles and this
Agreement), and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on
the parties



 

16 hereto. The Preliminary Valuation Date Statement and the Preliminary Purchase
Price, after giving effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of
the disputed matters by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be the
Valuation Date Statement and the Purchase Price, respectively, for purposes of
this Agreement, but shall not limit the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement
(except to the extent any Damages related to a breach of such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements would be duplicative of amounts
payable pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ ). The parties hereto shall make
available to Purchaser, CTI and, if applicable, the Independent Accounting
Firm, such books, records and other information (including work papers) as any
of the foregoing may reasonably request to prepare or review the Preliminary
Accounting Statement or any matters submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Purchaser and CTI in such manner that Purchaser shall be
responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses equal to such fees and
expenses multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate
dollar value of disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm
that are resolved against Purchaser (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) and the denominator of which is the total dollar value of the
disputed items so submitted, and CTI shall be responsible for the
remainder of such fees and expenses.



(d) Following the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to this
_Section 3.3_ , if (i) the Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, Purchaser shall pay Seller (A) the amount by which the Purchase Price
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price and (B) with interest thereon as
calculated pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ , and (ii) if the Purchase Price is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay Purchaser (A) the
amount by which the Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price
and (B) interest thereon as calculated pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ , in each
case, within five (5) business days after the Purchase Price is finally
determined.



(e) The party making the payment pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ shall pay
interest thereon to the other party for the period from the Closing Date to
the date of payment at the Prime Rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , Eastern Edition, on the Closing Date. Payment of such amounts and
interest thereon shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as are designated in writing by the party
entitled to receive such payment no later than the second Business Day prior
to the date on which such payment is due.

CTI the respective amounts set forth below on the terms set forth below (each,

the respective amounts set forth below, in each case on the terms set forth
below (each, a " _Sales Milestone Payment_ " and collectively, the " _Sales
Milestone Payments_ "):

consecutive calendar quarters exceed $50 million;

CTI shall only be eligible to receive a single payment for each Sales

than one Sales Milestone Payment with respect to a single four consecutive
quarter period as a result of the Worldwide Net Sales attained in a single

are achieved, then the Worldwide Net Sales for that calendar quarter may not
be counted to achieve a Sales Milestone with respect to any other subsequent
four calendar quarter period.



(ii) Purchaser will provide to CTI, within forty-five (45) days after the end
of each calendar quarter, commencing at the end of the first calendar quarter
ending after the Closing Date, a report setting forth in reasonable detail a
calculation of the Worldwide Net Sales

Business Days of receipt thereof the Purchaser Sales Milestone Report or upon
such earlier time as CTI shall provide written notice that it concurs with the
Purchaser Sales Milestone Report, such Report shall become final and binding
as the " _Final Sales Milestone Report_ " and shall be used to calculate the
Sales Milestone Payments. If CTI delivers notice to Purchaser objecting to the
Purchaser Sales Milestone Report within such 30-Business Day period the
Purchaser Sales Milestone Report shall be submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm which shall conduct an audit thereof within twenty (20)
Business Days after such submission or such longer period as the Independent
Accounting Firm may reasonably require (which audit shall be limited to the
calculation of Worldwide Net Sales in accordance with the terms hereof (it
being understood that such audit shall not cover, and the Independent
Accounting Firm shall not pass upon, the appropriateness of the PurchaserÂ’s
adjustments to gross sales under GAAP) and the mathematical accuracy of the
calculation contained in the Purchaser Sales Milestone Report). The
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Purchaser and CTI and the Purchaser Sales Milestone Report, as
adjusted by the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be the
Final Sales Milestone Report. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be paid by CTI unless the adjustments to the Purchaser
Sales Milestone Report determined to be made by the Independent Accounting
Firm would cause an additional Sales Milestone to be met that would not have
been met under the calculation of Worldwide Net Sales contained in the
Purchaser Sales Milestone Report, in which case the fees and disbursements of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by Purchaser.



(iii) All Sales Milestone Payments shall be calculated on the basis of
the Final Sale Milestone Reports and shall be made no later than the later of
(A) 60 days after the end of the four consecutive calendar quarter period in
which the applicable Sales Milestone giving rise to any Sales Milestone
Payment(s) is met and (B) three (3) Business Days after the date on which
Final Sales Milestone Reports for each of the calendar quarters in the
applicable four consecutive calendar quarter period are deemed to be
completed.



(c) All Development Milestone Payments and Sales Milestone Payments shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as are designated in writing by CTI, which designation shall be made
no later than the second Business Day after Sellers receive written notice
that they have become entitled to receive such payment.



(d) On and after the Closing Date, the control of the Business shall rest
with Purchaser and Sellers shall have no right to object to the manner in
which the Business is conducted after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have
complete discretion with respect to all decisions related to the Assets,
including decisions relating to the research, development, manufacture,
marketing, pricing and distribution of TRISENOX, and shall have no obligation
to conduct clinical trials related to, or otherwise pursue
regulatory approvals of, any indication for TRISENOX or otherwise take any
action to protect, attain or maximize any payment to be received by Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 3.4_. Purchaser shall have no obligation to follow
any business plan of Sellers or be legally bound by any such plan and shall
have no obligation to consult with Sellers with respect to the Business.
Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that, upon the written
request of CTI, representatives of Purchaser and CTI shall meet (in



 

19 person or telephonically) on such date and at such location as shall be agreed
upon by Purchaser and CTI to discuss the research, development and marketing
of TRISENOX (including clinical trade strategy and regulatory approval
strategies); _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not be obligated to cause its
representatives to attend such a meeting more than twice in any calendar year
and shall not be obligated to cause its representatives to attend such a
meeting after the second anniversary of the Closing.



Section 3.5. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. No later than thirty (30)
Business Days following the Closing Date, Sellers shall submit to Purchaser
in writing the allocation of the Purchase Price among all of the Assets in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation Notice_ "). Purchaser shall be
deemed to have accepted the Allocation Notice, and it shall be deemed final,
unless Purchaser provides written notice of disagreement to Sellers within
thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of the Allocation Notice (a "
_Disagreement Notice_ "). If Purchaser provides a Disagreement Notice,
Sellers and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
differences. If the disagreements cannot be resolved within ten (10) Business
Days of CTIÂ’s receipt of the Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Sellers shall
engage the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the differences. The
independent accounting firm will be requested to resolve the dispute and
determine the correct allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code, and issue its report within ten (10) Business Days of its engagement in
writing to Purchaser and Sellers (the " _Accounting Report_ "), or such longer
period as the accounting firm may require. One half of the fees of the
independent accounting firm shall be borne by Purchaser, and one half of such
fees shall be borne by Sellers. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall take a
position on any Tax return, before any governmental Tax agency or in a
judicial proceeding that is inconsistent with the Allocation Notice, if
final, or the Accounting Report, except as required by law. To the extent
required by Section 1060 of the Code, the Allocation Notice or Accounting
Report, as appropriate, will be revised to reflect any adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

the Confidentiality Agreement, from the date hereof until the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, Sellers and the Companies shall, and shall cause their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates,
consultants, counsel, accountants, investment bankers or representatives
(collectively, their " _Representatives_ ") to, afford the Representatives of
Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the offices,
properties, plants, other facilities and books and records of or relating to
the Business and to those Representatives of Sellers and the Companies who
have knowledge relating to the Business and shall furnish to Purchaser or its
Representatives such additional information concerning the Assets, the
Companies and the Business as shall be reasonably requested, including all
such information as shall be necessary to



 

40 enable Purchaser or its Representatives to verify the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, to verify that
the covenants of Sellers contained in this Agreement have been complied with
and to determine whether the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ have been
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and their Representatives
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the
Business. No investigation made by Purchaser or its Representatives hereunder
shall affect the representations and warranties of Sellers hereunder. 



Section 6.3. _Confidentiality_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect, and survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Closing and the consummation of the Transactions and/or the
termination of this Agreement. The parties hereby agree that the term "
_Confidential Information_ ," as used in the Confidentiality Agreement, shall
include all exhibits, schedules, certificates and other documents executed or
delivered in connection with the execution of the Transaction Agreements
and the consummation of the Transactions. With respect to Purchaser, the term
"Confidential Information" shall not apply to information relating to the
Business after the Closing but shall continue to apply after the Closing to
any other Confidential Information.



Section 6.4. _Regulatory Authorizations_.



(a) Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for the consummation
of the Transactions, and shall cooperate with each other in promptly seeking
to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals; _provided_
, that Sellers shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting the
Assets or the Business as a condition of obtaining any such
authorization, consent, order or approval without the prior written consent
of Purchaser.



(b) Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall make appropriate filings
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions promptly after the
date hereof. Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Companies and
Sellers, on the other hand, shall promptly (a) supply the others with any
information which may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b)
supply any additional information which reasonably may be required by any
Governmental Authority under the HSR Act to the extent provided by applicable
Laws. Except as prohibited by Law and subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers and the Companies, on the
other hand, shall consult with each other prior to taking any substantive
position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act in discussions with or
filing to be submitted to any Governmental Authority, shall permit the other
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any analyses, presentations, briefs, arguments,
memoranda and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with
respect to filings under the HSR Act, and shall coordinate with the other
in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other
(and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions
(and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any
Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement under the HSR Act;
_provided_ that with respect to any such filing, presentation or submission,
each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Companies and Sellers, on the
other hand, need not



 

41 supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or, in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Law applicable to such party
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information.



(c) Each party hereto shall make any required filings pursuant to foreign
antitrust regulations with respect to the Transactions promptly after the
date hereof and will cooperate with the other party in connection therewith.



(d) Each party warrants that all filings by it pursuant to or relating to the
HSR Act will be, as of the date filed, true and accurate and in accordance
with the requirements of the HSR Act. In no event shall Purchaser be required
to (A) sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate or agree to sell or
dispose of, any Assets, any other assets, categories of assets or businesses
of Purchaser, its subsidiaries or the Companies, (B) terminate existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations or (C) amend or terminate
existing licenses or other intellectual property agreements or enter into new
licenses or other intellectual property agreements to avoid, prevent or
terminate any action by any Governmental Authority which would restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prevent consummation of the Transactions.



Section 6.5. _Third Party Consents: Assignment of Contracts_. Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all such third party consents that are required in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ that none of Sellers, the
Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to pay any
fee or make any payment to obtain any such consent; and _provided_ , further
that Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, make any
agreement or understanding affecting the Assets or the Business as a condition
for obtaining any such consents except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall cooperate with and assist Sellers in obtaining
such consents.



Section 6.6. _Further Action_.



(a) Subject to _Sections 6.4_ and _6.5_ , each of the parties hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and
other papers, as may reasonably be required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and consummate and make
effective the Transactions, and to vest in Purchaser good and valid title to
the Shares and the Assets. In the case of licenses, certificates, approvals,
authorizations, agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other commitments
included in the Assets (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned
effectively without the consent of third parties which consent has not been
obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser at its
request in endeavoring to obtain such consent promptly, and if any
such consent is unobtainable, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
secure to Purchaser the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (b) which
are otherwise not transferable or assignable, Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts jointly with Purchaser to secure to Purchaser
the benefits thereof in some other manner (including the exercise of the
rights of Sellers thereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall relieve Sellers of their obligations under _Section 6.5_.
Notwithstanding anything in



 

42 this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any license, certificate, approval, authorization,
agreement, contract, lease, easement or other commitment included in the
Assets if an attempted assignment thereof without the consent of a third party
thereto would constitute a breach thereof.



(b) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that at any time or
from time to time after the Closing and prior to the third anniversary
thereof, Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall possess
any information belonging to or concerning Sellers or their Affiliates that is
not used in the operation of the Business (such information, the " _Seller
Information_ "), Purchaser shall promptly transfer, or cause to be
transferred, such Seller Information to Sellers (without retaining a copy
thereof). Prior to such transfer, Purchaser and their Affiliates shall hold
such Seller Information in confidence and not disclose such Seller Information
to any Person or utilize such Seller Information for any purpose. Seller
Information shall include written, graphical or machine-readable information
that relates to trade secrets, product plans, software and business plans,
litigation, agreements with third parties, customer and supplier information
and data stored electronically. Purchaser and their Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers to identify any
Seller Information that is in the possession of Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates.



(c) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Sellers and their
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of Sellers with respect to the Business transferred to Purchaser hereunder to
the extent that such access may reasonably be required by Seller in connection
with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Business prior
to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Purchaser upon receipt
of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Sellers shall
be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by them pursuant to
this _Section 6.6(c)_. If Purchaser shall desire to dispose of any of such
books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Purchaser
shall, prior to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at
SellersÂ’ expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Sellers
may select.



(d) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Business which Sellers or any of their Affiliates may retain
after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Sellers and their
Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any costs and
expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 6.6(d)_. If Sellers or any
of their Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records
prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Sellers shall, prior to such
disposition, give Purchaser a reasonable opportunity, at PurchaserÂ’s expense,
to segregate and remove such books and records as Purchaser may select.



(e) Sellers shall, and shall use reasonably best efforts to cause Grant
Thornton LLP to, cooperate with and provide to Purchaser and its
Representatives access to accounting records and such other financial
and business information of CTI with respect to the Business as may be
required in connection with the preparation of the pro forma and historical
financial statements or information relating to the Business which are
required to be filed by Purchaser with Governmental Authorities pursuant to
applicable Law, including without limitation, the



 

43 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and to
the officers and employees of Sellers for purposes of responding to questions
concerning the Business and such financial and other information (including
work papers). Such access shall be afforded by Sellers upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours. At the request of Purchaser, CTI
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Grant Thornton LLP to (i) audit or
perform such other procedures as appropriate with respect to the financial
statements of the Business (the " _GT Procedures_ ") for the periods for
which financial statements or information is required to be filed by Purchaser
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act and,
(ii) provide to Purchaser and its representatives access to its work papers
used in connection with such GT Procedures. The fees and expenses of Grant
Thornton LLP relating to the GT Procedures shall be paid by Purchaser and any
other fees or expenses of Grant Thornton LLP incurred pursuant to this
_Section 6.6(e)_ shall be paid by CTI .



Section 6.7. _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Purchaser and its
Representatives shall contact and communicate with the employees, customers,
suppliers, licensees and licensors of the Business in connection with the
Transactions and the Business only with the prior written consent of CTI (or
its designee, as evidenced by a writing delivered to Purchaser by Seller),
which consent may be conditioned upon a designee of Seller being present at
any such meeting or conference.



Section 6.8. _Use of Seller Â’s Intellectual Property_.

 



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it
is expressly agreed that Purchaser is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise
obtaining, and the Companies will not be entitled to retain following the
Closing Date, any right, title or interest in any Intellectual Property (other

the Closing Date, including without limitation, any trademarks or logos
employing SellersÂ’ names or any part or variation of such names or anything
confusingly similar thereto.



(b) As soon as practicable, and in any event within six months after the
Closing, Purchaser shall:



(i) remove "Cell Therapeutics" or any other similar mark and any other
trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Sellers, other than
those included in the Transferred Intellectual Property (the " _Seller Marks_

days, Purchaser shall cease using the Seller Marks in all invoices,
letterhead, and business cards.



(e) Purchaser acknowledge and agree that Seller and its Affiliates are the
exclusive owners of the Seller Marks and all goodwill attached thereto. Except
as set forth in this _Section 6.8_ , the Transaction Agreements do not
give Purchaser the right to use the Seller Marks and Purchaser agrees not to
use any trademarks, service marks, trade names or logos that are substantially
similar to the Seller Marks. Purchaser will use Seller Marks as specified by
Seller policy, a copy of which has been provided to Purchaser. Purchaser
agree not to attempt to register the Seller Marks nor to register anywhere in
the world a mark the same as or substantially similar to the Seller Marks.
Seller hereby grants Purchaser and its Affiliates a royalty-free right to use
the Seller Marks to the extent provided in this _Section 6.8_.



(f) In no event shall Purchaser advertise or hold itself out as CTI (or an
Affiliate of CTI or otherwise associated with CTI) after the Closing Date. 



(g) For purposes of this _Section 6.8_ , references to "Seller" shall mean
Seller, together with its Subsidiaries, and references to "Purchaser" shall
mean Purchaser, together with their Subsidiaries (including the Companies).



Section 6.9. _Inter-company Accounts and Agreements_.



(a) Effective at the Closing, (i) all inter-company ( _i.e_. between

written, oral or otherwise, which are solely between the Companies, on the
one hand, and Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the
other hand, shall be terminated and of no further effect, in each case without
any further action or liability on the part of the parties thereto. With
respect to any inter-company debt as to which UK is the obligor, prior to the
Closing, such debt shall be converted to ordinary shares of UK, credited as
fully paid.



(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall terminate the Cross-

Companies and the Assets).



 

45 Section 6.11. _Preserve Accuracy of Representations and Warranties; Notice of
Developments_. 



(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, each party will
refrain from taking any action that would render any representation or
warranty of such party contained herein inaccurate as of the Closing Date.
Each party shall give prompt notice to the other parties (i) if any
representation or warranty by such party contained in this Agreement shall
have become untrue or inaccurate, (ii) of any failure of such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, in each case such that the conditions to closing
set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_  or _Section 9.2(c)_ , in the case of
Purchaser, or _Section 9.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(c)_ , in the case of Sellers or
the Companies, would not be satisfied and (iii) of any action, suit or
proceeding that may be instituted or threatened against such party to
restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, Sellers shall notify Purchaser of (x) any notice or
other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (y) any
material default by Sellers or the Companies under any Material Contract or
event, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become such a default on
or prior to the Closing Date and of which Sellers have Knowledge and (z) any
Material Adverse Effect. No disclosure by Sellers pursuant to this _Section
6.11(a)_ shall be deemed to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant.



(b) Sellers may, from time to time prior to the Closing Date, supplement or
amend the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
supplemental disclosure shall prevent Purchaser from exercising their rights
(i) to indemnification for any breaches of representations or warranties
pursuant to _Article XI_ or _Article VIII_ , (ii) not to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the condition set
forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ , or (iii) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

remittance from any account debtors with respect to the Receivables, such
Seller shall endorse such remittance to the order of Purchaser and forward it

encourage, or furnish information with respect to the Business or the
Proteasome Rights or engage in any discussions with any Person in connection
with, any proposal for the acquisition of all or a substantial



 

46 portion of the Business, the shares of the Companies or the Proteasome Rights,
other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers will promptly cease or
cause to be terminated any existing activities or discussions with any Person
with respect to any of the foregoing.

(a) Effective immediately after the Closing, Purchaser (which for purposes of
this Section may include any of PurchaserÂ’s Affiliates) shall make an offer
of employment to each of the employees of Sellers listed on _Section 6.14(a)_
of the Disclosure Schedule ("Business Employees"), which offer shall be
conditioned upon, among other things, (A) the execution of any
agreements which Purchaser requires of new employees as a condition of
employment, including any confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation,
intellectual property or other similar agreement and (B) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, background checks, drug screening tests and

Closing Date or (ii) are on an approved leave of absence with Sellers as of
the Closing Date but commence active employment with Purchaser within twelve
(12) weeks after the Closing Date (collectively, " _Transferring Employees_ ")
shall receive service credit for service with Sellers or their Affiliates to
the same extent such credit was granted under SellersÂ’ comparable employee
benefit plans.



(c) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, (i) nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Purchaser
to continue the employment of any employee for any period following the
Closing Date and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Purchaser from
altering, amending or terminating any of its employee benefit plans, or the
participation of any of its employees in such plans, at any time.



(d) To the extent permitted by PurchaserÂ’s employee benefit plans, all
Transferring Employees who are eligible to participate in such plans as of the
Closing Date, taking into account any service credited pursuant to _Section
6.14(b)_ , shall commence such participation on the Closing Date. To the
extent permitted by PurchaserÂ’s medical plans, each Transferring Employee
shall receive credit under such plans for all amounts paid during the current

evidence of such paid amounts.



(e) With respect to each Business Employee, Sellers shall retain
the obligation and liability for any workersÂ’ compensation or similar

retain, pay, perform and discharge, and Purchaser shall not assume or be
obligated to pay, perform or discharge, any liability or obligation under any
employee benefit plan of either Sellers or their Affiliates (including, with
respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, the Companies).



 

47 (f) Without limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall honor all commitments made
by Sellers or any of their Affiliates to Business Employees with respect to
(i) tuition assistance for any semester that has begun prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) adoption assistance applied for prior to the Closing Date.



(g) Subject to requirements of applicable Laws, Sellers shall transfer
to Purchaser on the Closing Date complete copies of the personnel records of
Transferring Employees.



(h) Purchaser shall have no liabilities: (i) related to the employees of
Sellers who do not become employed by Purchaser; (ii) related to
Transferring Employees to the extent such liability arises from any action,
event or course of conduct prior to the Closing Date; or (iii) to the extent
such liability arises under or relates to any Seller Plans.



(i) Purchaser shall not have responsibility for any severance or
termination pay obligations or damages for wrongful dismissal, including,
without limitation, obligations arising under the common law, incurred with
respect to any period of employment prior to the Closing Date or with respect
to any termination of employment by or with Sellers or any of their
Affiliates. Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for 100% of the severance costs
incurred by Purchaser with respect to Transferring Employees whose employment
is terminated by Purchaser without cause prior to the three-month anniversary
of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of the
reimbursement by Sellers pursuant to this _Section 6.14(i)_ shall be limited
to $350,000.

is entitled to COBRA coverage. 



(k) Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid from funds provided by them to each
Business Employee, not later than the next regular payroll date following the

Date with respect to such employee. Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid
from funds provided by them to each Business Employee any bonus compensation
accrued as of the Closing Date to which such employee may be entitled as a
result of his or her participation in a bonus plan of Sellers or their
Affiliates, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan (except
that it shall not be a condition to such payment, or the accrual of the amount
payable, that such employee remain an employee of Sellers or their Affiliates
after the Closing Date) and in the time frame normally called for by such
plan.



 

48 (l) Sellers and their Affiliates, including the Companies, shall comply with
all notice and other requirements under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") and any regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any similar laws with respect to actions taken by Sellers or
their Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to applicable Law,
in the event that, prior to the Closing Date, there is any employee employed
by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the Business whose employment
is terminated, whose work hours are reduced, who is laid off or who otherwise
experiences an "employment loss," within the meaning of the WARN Act (each, an
" _Affected Employee_ "), Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser of (i) each
Affected EmployeeÂ’s name, site of employment, date of employment loss and
nature of employment loss and (ii) the total number of employees at each site
of employment listed in response to clause (i) immediately prior to the ninety
(90) day period ending on the Closing Date. Subject to applicable Law,

respect to current and former employees employed by Sellers with respect to
the Business or the Companies, and shall, at PurchaserÂ’s request and in the
manner reasonably directed by Purchaser, provide, or assist Purchaser in
providing, notice to some or all employees employed by Sellers with respect to
the Business or the Companies in accordance with the WARN Act.



(m) Sellers and their Affiliates shall waive any non-competition, non-
solicitation, confidentiality and any other restrictions that would otherwise
limit the scope of any Business EmployeeÂ’s services to Purchaser.



ARTICLE VII



NON-COMPETE



Section 7.1. _Covenant Not to Compete or Solicit Business_.

 



(a) In furtherance of the sale of the Assets and the Business to Purchaser
hereunder by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby and more
effectively to protect the value and goodwill of the Assets and the Business
so sold, Sellers hereby jointly and severally covenant and agree that, for a
period ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Seller
nor any of their respective Affiliates will :



(i) directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent, independent
contractor, partner or otherwise) own, manage, operate, control, participate
in, perform services for, or otherwise carry on, any Competitive Business
anywhere in the world (it being understood by the parties hereto that the
Business is not limited to any particular region of world and that the
Business may be engaged in effectively from any location in the world);



(ii) induce or attempt to persuade any distributor, agent, supplier or
customer of the Business to terminate such distributor, agency or business
relationship in order to enter into any such relationship on behalf of any
other business organization in competition with the Business;



 

49 provided, however, that nothing set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall prohibit
Sellers or their Affiliates from owning not in excess of 5% in the aggregate
of any class of capital stock of any corporation if such stock is publicly
traded and listed on any national or regional stock exchange or on the Nasdaq
national market. Sellers also jointly and severally covenant and agree that
from and after the Closing Date neither of them will, nor will permit any of
its respective Affiliates to, divulge or make use of any trade secrets or
other confidential information of the Business other than to disclose
such secrets and information to Purchaser or its Affiliates.



(b) If either Seller or any Affiliate of either Seller violates any of its
obligations under this _Section 7.1_ , Purchaser may proceed against it in law
or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate.
Sellers acknowledge that a violation of this _Section 7.1_ may cause
Purchaser irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by
money damages. Sellers therefore agree that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this _Section 7.1_ , Purchaser shall be entitled, in
addition to other remedies that it may have, to a temporary restraining order
and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against such Seller or such
Affiliate of Sellers to prevent any violations of this  _Section 7.1_ ,
without the necessity of posting a bond. The prevailing party in any action
commenced under this _Section 7.1_ shall also be entitled to receive
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and court costs. It is the intent
and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any action before any
court or agency legally empowered to enforce this _Section 7.1_ , any term,
restriction, covenant or promise in this _Section 7.1_ is found to be
unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction,
covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make
it enforceable by such court or agency.

Section 8.3. _Tax Covenants_.



 

(a) Except as provided in this Agreement or as consented to in writing by
either Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), Purchaser hereby covenants that it will not and will not cause or
permit the Companies or any Affiliate of Purchaser (i) to take any action on
the Closing Date (but after the Closing) other than in the ordinary course of
business, including but not limited to the distribution of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption, that could give rise to any Tax liability
or reduce any Tax Asset of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or give rise
to any loss of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates under this Agreement,
(ii) to make or change any Tax election, amend any Return or take any Tax
position on any Return, take any action or enter into any transaction, merger
or restructuring that in any such case results in any increased Tax liability
or reduction of any Tax Asset of Sellers or any of their Affiliates in respect
of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iii) carry back any Tax Asset of either of
the Companies to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.



(b) (i) Sellers shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies, the Business or
the Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Returns of the Companies
for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Period Returns_ ")), and in each case
Sellers shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such
Returns, and (ii) Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to either of the Companies,
the Business or the Assets, and Purchaser shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Returns. The Purchaser shall deliver the
Straddle Period Returns to Seller no later than thirty (30) days prior to its
due date for timely filing, for SellerÂ’s review and approval. Seller shall be
deemed to have approved a Straddle Period Return unless Seller delivers to
the Purchaser within ten (10) days of receipt of such Straddle Period Return,
a written notice of disagreement ("Disagreement Notice") that sets forth the
items of



 

52 disagreement. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
differences. If no resolution is reached within ten (10) days of the receipt
by the Purchaser of the Disagreement Notice, the items of disagreement shall
be submitted to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the parties for resolution. The independent accounting firm
will accept SellerÂ’s position so long as the accounting firm believes such
position is more likely than not the correct position. The determination of
the independent accountant shall be final and binding for purposes of
this Agreement. Purchaser shall not file an amended Return for or with
respect to either of the Companies, the Business or the Assets for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without SellersÂ’ prior written consent.



(ii) Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall reimburse the
other party the Taxes for which Seller or Purchaser is liable pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ but which are remitted in respect of any Return to be
filed by the other party pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_ upon the written
request of the party entitled to reimbursement setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount owed by Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be,
but in no event earlier than 10 days prior to the due date for paying such
Taxes. All Returns which Sellers are required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this _Section 8.3(b)_ and all Straddle Period Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such
Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing
and filing similar Returns in prior periods (including, but not limited to,
positions, elections or methods which would have the effect of deferring
income to periods for which Purchaser is liable under this _Article VIII_ or
accelerating deductions to periods for which Sellers are liable under this
_Article VIII_ ).



(c) Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Sellers all
refunds of Taxes for which Sellers are liable under this _Article VIII_ and
any interest thereon received by Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser or the
Companies. If, in lieu of receiving any such refund, either of the Companies
reduces a Tax liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period or
increases a Tax Asset that can be utilized in a Post-Closing Tax Period,
Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of such
reduction in Tax liability or the amount of any benefit resulting from such
increase in Tax Assets, as the case may be. The benefit resulting from an
increase in a Tax Asset shall be calculated on the same basis as applicable to
Tax Benefits pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_.



(d) Sellers shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser all
refunds of Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under this _Article VIII_ and
any interest thereon received by Sellers or any of their Affiliates
attributable to the Companies. If, in lieu of receiving any such refund,
Sellers or any of their Affiliates reduce a Tax liability with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or increase a Tax Asset that can be utilized in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Sellers shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to
Purchaser the amount of such reduction in Tax liability or the amount of any
benefit resulting from such increase in Tax Assets, as the case may be. The
benefit resulting from an increase in a Tax Asset shall be calculated on the
same basis as applicable to Tax Benefits pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_. 



(e) All Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid one-half by Purchaser and one-
half by Sellers, and each party will, at its own expense, file all necessary
Returns and other



 

53 documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all such Transfer
Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the other party will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Returns and other
documentation. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate to minimize any such Transfer Taxes by utilizing remote electronic
transmission or "load and leave" procedures.



(f) Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify Sellers, their Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers and employees against any and all Damages (as
defined in _Section 11.2_ ) incurred or suffered by any such Person arising
out of (i) any Excluded Taxes (as defined in _Section 8.6(a)_ ), (ii) any Tax
incurred or suffered by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, arising out of a
breach by Purchaser of any other covenant or agreement contained in this
_Article VIII_ and (iii) any Tax imposed on either of the Companies for any
Post-Closing Tax Period. Sellers agree to give prompt notice to Purchaser of
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Action, in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this _Section 8.3(f)_. Purchaser may
participate in any such Action at their own expense and the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.



(g) (i) At the request of Purchaser, CTI and Purchaser shall make a joint
election for PolaRx under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any
applicable similar provisions of state or local law with respect to the
purchase of the PolaRx Shares (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). Sellers
represent that PolaRx is a member of SellersÂ’ "selling consolidated group"
(as such term is defined in Section 338(h)(10)(B) of the Code).



(ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to make, at its sole option, an election
under Section 338 of the Code for UK (the " _Non-U.S. Section 338 Election_
").



(iii) If a Section 338(h)(10) Election and/or a Non-U.S. Section 338 Election
is made, Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate that portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to the PolaRx Shares under _Section 3.5_ of this Agreement
among the assets of PolaRx (in the case of a Section 338(h)(10) Election) and
that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the UK Shares under _Section
3.5_ of this Agreement among the assets of UK (in the case of a Non-U.S.
Section 338 Election), in each case as set forth under applicable Treasury
Regulations. Neither Sellers, Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall file any Return or other document or otherwise take, or agree to take,
any position on any Return which is inconsistent with the allocation
determined pursuant to this _Section 8.3(g)(iii)_ and _Section 3.5_ unless
otherwise required by law, and shall not to take, or cause to be taken, any
action that would be inconsistent with or prejudice any Section 338(h)(10)
Election or Non-U.S. Section 338 Election.



Section 8.4. _Tax Sharing_. Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements
between the Companies or either of the Companies and any member of any Company
Group shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none of the
Companies, Sellers nor any Affiliates of Sellers shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder. This Agreement shall be the sole Tax sharing
agreement relating to the Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.



Section 8.5. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Purchaser and Sellers agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Companies, the Business



  

54 and the Assets as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Return, for
the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Purchaser and
Sellers agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and records
pertinent to the Companies, the Business and the Assets until the applicable
period for assessment under applicable Law (giving effect to any and all
extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with
all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.
Purchaser agrees to give Sellers reasonable notice prior to transferring,
discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters
and, if Sellers so request, Purchaser shall allow Sellers to take possession
of such books and records. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the
Companies, the Business and the Assets for any Tax purposes and each shall
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this subsection. Purchaser shall not make
any payment of Taxes with respect to any audit or other proceedings involving
either of the Companies, the Business or the Assets for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period without SellersÂ’ prior written consent.



Section 8.6. _Tax Indemnification by Seller_.



(a) Sellers hereby agree to jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser, its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees against any
and all Damages (as defined in Section 11.2) incurred or suffered by any such
Person arising out of (i) all Taxes attributable to the Business or the
Assets, or imposed on Sellers or either of the Companies, or for which the
Sellers or either of the Companies may otherwise be liable, in each case
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, without limitation, any
obligations to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis), (ii) all Taxes imposed on either of
the Companies, or for which either of the Companies may otherwise be liable,
as a result of being or having been a member of a Company Group (including,
without limitation, Taxes for which either of the Companies may be liable
pursuant to Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or
foreign law as a result of having been a member of a Company Group and any
Taxes resulting from either of the Companies ceasing to be a member of a
Company Group), (iii) any Tax liability arising under Subpart F of the Code
attributable to income recognized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) all
Section 338 Taxes, (v) any breach by Sellers of any representation or warranty
contained in this Article VIII, and (vi) any failure by Sellers to perform or
comply with any of their respective covenants or agreements in each case to
be performed or complied with by Sellers pursuant to this Article VIII;
provided, however, that Sellers shall have no liability for the payment of any
Damages attributable to or resulting from any of the matters described in
Section 8.3(a) hereof or for any Tax liability arising under Subpart F of the
Code attributable to income recognized in a Post-Closing Tax Period (items
described in this proviso, the "Excluded Taxes"); and provided, further, that
Sellers shall be obligated to make payments to Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 8.6 only to the extent that the cumulative amount that would otherwise
be payable by Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.6 (notwithstanding this
proviso) exceeds the aggregate amount of the provisions for Tax liabilities
of the Companies reflected on the Valuation Date Statement.



(b) If SellersÂ’ indemnification obligation under this _Section 8.6_ arises in
respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Purchaser, any of their
Affiliates or, effective



 

55 upon the Closing, the Companies, any deduction, amortization, exclusion from
income or other allowance (a " _Tax Benefit_ ") which would not, but for such
adjustment, be allowable, then any payment by Sellers to Purchaser shall be an
amount equal to (x) the amount otherwise due but for this subsection (b),
minus (y) the present value of the Tax Benefit multiplied by the maximum
federal, provincial or state or local, as the case may be, corporate Tax rate
in effect at the time the relevant adjustment is made or, in the case of a
credit, by one hundred percent (100%). The present value referred to in the
preceding sentence shall be determined using a discount rate equal to 8% and
assuming that the Tax Benefit will be used at the earliest date or dates
allowable by applicable Law and calculating such Tax Benefit as if Purchaser
or any other Indemnified Party had no other deductions, losses or credits for
the applicable period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, SellersÂ’ indemnification obligation under this _Section 8.6_ shall
not be reduced or affected by any Tax Benefit received by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates as a direct or indirect result of any Section 338(h)(10)
Election or Non-U.S. Section 338 Election having been made.



(c) Any payment by Sellers pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be made not
later than thirty (30) days after receipt by Sellers of written notice from
Purchaser stating that Damages have been suffered by Purchaser, any of their
Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the Companies, and the amount
thereof and of the indemnity payment requested.



(d) If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to this _Section 8.6_ is asserted in writing against
Purchaser, any of their Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the
Companies, Purchaser shall notify Sellers of such claim or demand within ten
(10) days of receipt thereof, or such earlier time that would allow Sellers to
timely respond to such claim or demand, and shall give Sellers such
information with respect thereto as Sellers may reasonably request; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to comply with this provision shall not
affect PurchaserÂ’s right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
such failure materially impairs SellersÂ’ ability to contest any such claim or
demand. Sellers may discharge, at any time, its indemnification obligation
under this _Section 8.6_ by paying to Purchaser the amount payable pursuant to
this _Section 8.6_. Sellers may, at their own expense, participate in and,
upon notice to Purchaser, assume the defense of any such claim or demand
(including any Tax audit); _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall have no
right to represent either of the CompaniesÂ’ interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding unless Sellers shall have first notified
Purchaser in writing of SellersÂ’ intention to do so and shall have agreed with
Purchaser in writing that, as between Purchaser and Sellers, Sellers shall be
liable for any Taxes that result from such audit or proceeding to the extent
such Taxes relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. If Sellers assume such defense,
Sellers shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense and
Purchaser shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at their own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by Sellers. Whether or not Sellers choose to defend or
prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.



(e) Sellers shall not be liable under this _Section 8.6_ for any settlements
effected without the consent of Sellers, or resulting from any claim or demand
with respect to which Sellers were not notified pursuant to _Section 8.6(d)_
to the extent any Seller was actually prejudiced.



 

56 Section 8.7. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any amount paid by Sellers or
Purchaser under this  _Article VIII_ shall be made on an After-Tax Basis (but
only to the extent not already taken into account in computing Damages payable
under this _Article VIII_ ), and to the extent such payment can be properly so
characterized under applicable Tax Law, shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.



Section 8.8. _Allocation of Taxes for Straddle Period; Apportioned
Obligations_.



(a) For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of either of the Companies for a
Straddle Period or the allocation of Tax liability arising under Subpart F of
the Code between a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period, such
determination shall be made by assuming that the Straddle Period or applicable
Tax period, as the case may be, consisted of two taxable years or periods,
one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of such Company for the Straddle Period, or
the Tax liability arising under Subpart F of the Code, shall be allocated
between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by
assuming that the books of such Company were closed at the close of the
Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods
on a daily basis.



(b) All Apportioned Obligations shall be apportioned between Seller and
Purchaser based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period included
in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and
Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such taxes that is
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.



(c) Apportioned Obligations shall be timely paid, and all applicable
filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as provided by applicable Law.
The paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying party
in accordance with _Section 8.8(a)_. Upon payment of any such Apportioned
Obligation, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying
party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is
entitled under _Section 8.8(a)_ together with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying
party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten
(10) days after the presentation of such statement. Any payment not made
within such time shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Prime
Rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect
from time to time, for each day until paid.



Section 8.9. _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this 
_Article VIII_ shall be unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect
without limitation as to time.



Section 8.10. _Set-Off_. Purchaser shall have the right (but shall not be
obligated to) to set-off against, and reduce the amounts otherwise payable in
respect of, the Development



 

57 Milestone Payments and the Sales Milestone Payments any Damages for which
Purchaser or any Affiliate, director, officer or employee of Purchaser is
entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to this Article VIII. If any Damages for
which Purchaser or any Affiliate, director, officer or employee of Purchaser
is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII is not satisfied
by set-off against the Development Milestone Payments or the Sales Milestone
Payments, such indemnification payment shall be made by Sellers in cash.

any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

contained in _Article VIII_ of this Agreement), (ii) any failure by Sellers to
perform or comply with any of their respective covenants or agreements in each
case to be performed or complied with by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
or any Seller Ancillary Agreement (other than any covenant or agreement made

their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and
employees against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any such Person
arising out of (i) any breach by Purchaser of any representation or warranty

million.



Section 11.3. _Procedures_.



(a) The Person seeking indemnification under _Section 11.2_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any
claim for indemnification under this _Article XI_ (a " _Claim_ ") describing
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the Claim and including (if
known) the amount of, or method of computation of the amount of the Claim and
a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument executed hereunder in connection with which the Claim is
based. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party and then only
with respect to such 



 

62 prejudice. The Indemnifying Party may make a written objection to any Claim,
which objection shall be delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after notice of the Claim is delivered to the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith
to resolve any Claim to which an objection is made. If such parties are able
to resolve any such Claim, they shall prepare and sign a written agreement
setting forth such agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
applicable Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by such Indemnified Party the agreed-upon amount of
the Damages as set forth in the agreement.



(b) If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve
a Claim to which an objection has been made within thirty (30) days (as
such period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party), the amount of Damages to which an
Indemnified Party shall be entitled shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (ii) by a
final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by
any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the
time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been
taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.



(c) Any obligation to provide indemnification hereunder with respect to any
Claim asserted by any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), except with
respect to Tax proceedings, which shall be governed by Article VIII, shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:



(i) Within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party
stating whether it disputes the Third Party Claim and whether it will defend
against such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense against such Third Party Claim, such notice
shall contain the written acknowledgement and agreement that, if such Third
Party Claim shall be adversely determined, the Indemnifying Party has an
obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense,
subject to the foregoing and to _Section 11.4_ , to assume and control the
defense, compromise, settlement and investigation of such Third Party Claim,
including the management of any proceeding relating thereto, and to employ
and engage counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain control of the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its
own choice (and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim, at its sole cost and expense and through
counsel of its own choice) if Indemnifying Party fails to acknowledge
in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Third Party Claim or if such Third Party Claim involves (w) a claim for
an injunction against any business or operations of the Indemnified Party, (x)
a criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (y)
any Intellectual Property of the Business, or (z) any customer of the Business
that was one of the BusinessÂ’s top 5 customers by revenue for the 12 months
prior to the date of such Claim or that is reasonably expected to be one of
the BusinessÂ’s top 5 customers by revenue for the 12 months following the date
of such Claim, and the Purchaser reasonably believes that the prosecution or
defense of such Third Party Claim could materially



 

63 and adversely affect the PurchaserÂ’s relationship with such customer. The
Indemnified Party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in
the defense of any Third Party Claim at its own cost and expense directly or
through counsel; _provided, however_ , that if the named parties to a
proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that (i) representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct or (ii) there may be one or more legal
or equitable defenses available to it that are different from or additional
to those available to the Indemnifying Party, then, in either case, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party (except that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one separate
counsel for all Indemnified Parties, taken together). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party, during the period the Indemnifying Party is
determining whether to elect to assume the defense of a matter covered by this
_Section 11.3_ , may take such reasonable actions as it deems necessary to
preserve any and all rights with respect to the matter, without such actions
being construed as a waiver of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s rights to defense and
indemnification under this Agreement.



(ii) If the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake the defense
and investigation of any such Third Party Claim as provided in
_Section 11.3(c)(i)_ , then (x) the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in such efforts and make available to the
Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnified PartyÂ’s possession, under its control or to which it may have
access as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, and (y) the
Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the
progress of the defense of any such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to undertake the defense and investigation of any such Third Party
Claim as provided in _Section 11.3(c)(i)_ , including conducting a good faith
and diligent defense, or if the Indemnified Party retains control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 11.3(c)(i)_ , then
(x) the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been
asserted shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise,
settlement and investigation of such Third Party Claim on behalf of, and at
the cost and expense of and for the account and risk of, the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnified
Party in such efforts and make available to the Indemnified Party all
witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s
possession, under its control or to which it may have access as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party, and (iii) the Indemnified
Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of
the defense of any such Third Party Claim.



Section 11.4. _Settlement of Indemnity Claims_. The Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) pay,
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which written
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), pay, compromise or
settle any such Third Party Claim.



 

64 Section 11.5. _Calculation of Damages_.



(a) The amount of any Damages payable under _Section 11.2_ by
the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable
by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (net of any
premium increase) or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor.
If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party, net of any premium increase, with respect to applicable
insurance policies, and net of expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount.



(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under _Section 11.2_ for any
(i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in
the Valuation Date Statement a specific liability or reserve relating to such
matter or (ii) incidental, special, consequential or punitive Damages, except
that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for incidental, special,
consequential or punitive Damages to the extent such Damages result from a
Third Person Claim for incidental, special, consequential or punitive Damages.



Section 11.6. _Exclusivity_. Without limiting the rights or remedies that
cannot be waived as a matter of law and injunctive and provisional
relief (including specific performance) and except as specifically set forth
in this Agreement (including _Article VIII_ ), after the Closing, the
provisions of this _Article XI_ will provide the sole and exclusive remedy for
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or
other claim arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.



Section 11.7. _Set-Off_. Purchaser shall have the right to (but shall not be
obligated to) set-off against, and reduce the amounts otherwise payable in
respect of, the Development Milestone Payments and the Sales Milestone
Payments any Damages for which Purchaser or any Affiliate, director, officer
or employee of Purchaser have been determined to be entitled to be reimbursed
pursuant to this  _Article XI_ by (i) written agreement of the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, (ii) a judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction (whether or not deemed final in accordance with
_Section 11.5(b)_ ) or (iii) any other means to which the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall agree; _provided_ , that if any amount is
set-off pursuant to this _Section 11.8_ on the basis of Damages determined
pursuant to clause (ii) above and the amount of such Damages is reduced at
the time that a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction is
deemed final with respect to the applicable Claim pursuant to _Section
11.3(b)_ , then within three (3) Business Days of the final judgment
or decree with respect to such Claim, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the
difference between the amount that was previously set-off and the amount of
Damages, if any, to which the Indemnified Party was deemed to be entitled in
the final judgment or decree plus interest from the date of set-off to the
date of payment at the Prime Rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
Eastern Edition, on the date of the final judgment or decree; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Damages with respect to such Claim are determined by
a final judgment or decree to be greater than the Damages previously set-off,



 

65 Purchaser shall be entitled to set-off the amount of such excess pursuant to
this _Section 11.8_. If any Damages for which Purchaser or any Affiliate,
director, officer or employee of Purchaser is entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this _Article XI_ is not satisfied by set-off against the
Development Milestone Payments or the Sales Milestone Payments, such
indemnification payment shall be made by Sellers in cash.



Section 11.8. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payment by Purchaser or
Sellers under this _Article XI_ shall be made on an After-Tax Basis, and to
the extent such payment can be properly so characterized under applicable
Tax Law, shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.



Section 11.9. _Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all matters relating to Taxes shall be governed by the provisions
of _Article VIII_.

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to

ii TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT



Transition Services Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of  _
_, 2005, by and between Cell Therapeutics, Inc., a Washington corporation
("CTI"), and Cephalon, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser").



_RECITALS_  



WHEREAS, CTI, CTI Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (" _Nevada_ ") and
Purchaser, have entered into an Acquisition Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Purchaser will
purchase the Business. Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined
herein, shall have the meaning specified in the Acquisition Agreement.



WHEREAS, for the periods provided herein, in order to facilitate the orderly
and effective separation of the Business from CTIÂ’s corporate group, Purchaser
desires to receive from CTI and/or one or more of its Affiliates certain
services, which services require assets or employees of CTI and/or one or more
of its Affiliates, after the Closing Date (which Closing Date shall be the
effective date of this Agreement (the " _Effective Date_ ")). 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the covenants and
agreements set forth below, the Parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I

For the purpose of this Agreement, the following capitalized terms shall have
the following meanings:

Agreement.

ARTICLE II 

TRANSITION SERVICE SCHEDULES



Section 2.1. _Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, beginning on the Effective Date and continuing until the
Expiration Date, CTI, either directly or indirectly through one or more of
its Affiliates, shall provide to Purchaser those services described in the
Transition Service Schedules (the " _Services_ "). The Transition Service
Schedules shall be considered part of this Agreement and are incorporated
herein by reference.



Section 2.2. _Schedules_. The Parties shall set forth in each Transition
Service Schedule, among other things, the time period during which the Service
will be provided if different from the term of this Agreement determined
pursuant to _Article IV_ hereof; a summary of the Service to be provided; a
description of the Service; and the estimated charge, if any, for the Service
(if priced on a basis other than as set forth in _Section 5.1_  hereof) and
any other terms applicable thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that it may not be practicable to describe each Service
in detail and that, therefore, a Service, when generally agreed upon by
the Parties will be provided and paid for in accordance with the applicable
terms of this Agreement even where such Service is not described in detail in
a Schedule.



ARTICLE III

SERVICES



Section 3.1. _Services Generally_. Except as otherwise provided herein, for
the term determined pursuant to _Article IV_ hereof, the Providers shall
provide or cause to be provided to the Receiving Party the Service(s)
described herein and in the Transition Service Schedule(s) attached hereto,
as well as training to employees of Receiving Party in order to facilitate the
transition of the Services to employees of Receiving Party as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The Designated Representatives
identified in the Transition Service Schedules shall meet no less than monthly
to discuss the Services and the timing of transition of the Services to
employees of Receiving Party.



 

A-2 Section 3.2. _Service Limitations_.



(a) Except as provided in a Transition Service Schedule for a specific
Service: (a) a Provider shall not be required to provide the Services except
to the extent and at the locations such Services were provided prior to the
Effective Date and (b) the Services will be available only for purposes of
conducting the Business substantially in the manner it was conducted prior to
the Effective Date.



(b) Except as provided in  _Section 6.5(a)_ , nothing in this Agreement shall
require CTI or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, to obtain any
additional licenses, systems, personnel or operations to provide or comply
with the obligations set forth in this Agreement; provided, that CTI and its
Affiliates shall maintain the licenses, systems, personnel or operations as in
existence as of the date hereof, or shall replace any such licenses, systems,
personnel or operations which shall be terminated after the date hereof with
substantially similar licenses, systems, personnel or operations to the extent
necessary to provide or comply with the obligations set forth in this
Agreement.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Services shall not be resold, transferred or
otherwise be used in any way other than in the ordinary course of the
Business.



Section 3.3. _Exceptions to Obligations_. The only exceptions to the
obligations of a Provider to provide the Services as contemplated hereby are
if (a) the Provider cannot provide such Services due to causes which are
outside of its reasonable control as determined under _Article XIV_ , (b)
providing the Services would be prohibited by law, regulation or court order,
(c) subject to  _Section 6.5(a)_ , providing the Services would require the
Provider to use a third partyÂ’s intellectual property in a manner for which
the Provider is not licensed or (d) providing the Services would require the
Provider to maintain the employment of existing employees that would
otherwise be terminated for cause.



Section 3.4. _Additional Services_. From time to time after the Effective
Date, the Parties may identify and mutually agree upon additional Services
that Provider will provide to a Receiving Party in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (the " _Additional Services_ "). At such time, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith additional Transition Service Schedules for such
Additional Services pursuant to _Article II_.



ARTICLE IV

TERM



The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
remain in effect until six months after the Effective Date (the " _Expiration
Date_ "), unless earlier terminated under _Article VII_ ;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, within the thirty day period prior to the Expiration Date
the Receiving Party, with respect to one or more Services, notifies CTI that
the Receiving Party, despite having exercised its commercially reasonable
best efforts, cannot obtain from a third party or provide itself a particular
Service after the six month anniversary of the Effective Date (an " _Extended
Service Requirement_ "), then with respect to such Extended
Service Requirement, the Provider shall provide that Service until the nine-
month anniversary of the



 

A-3 Effective Date, or for such shorter period of time (which shall be no less
than 30 days) as Receiving Party may specify. This Agreement may be extended
by the Parties in writing, either in whole or with respect to one or more of
the Services; _provided_ , _however_ , that such extension shall only apply to
the specific Services for which the Agreement was extended. The Parties shall
be deemed to have extended this Agreement with respect to a specific Service
if the Transition Service Schedule for such Service specifies a completion
date beyond the aforementioned Expiration Date. The Parties may agree on an
earlier expiration date respecting a specific Service by specifying such date
on the Transition Service Schedule for that Service. Services shall be
provided up to and including the date set forth in the applicable Transition
Service Schedule, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.



ARTICLE V 

COMPENSATION



Section 5.1. _Charges for Services_. The Receiving Party shall pay to the
Provider $125 per hour (the " _Hourly Charge_ ") for each hour recorded by a
CTI employee, Affiliate, consultant, or subcontractor for each Service
provided, or the charges otherwise set forth on a Transition Service Schedule,
plus, in any and all cases, 5% as an addition to such Hourly Charge for a
Service provided between 91 and 120 days after the Effective Date and plus
10% as an addition to such Hourly Charge for a Service provided 121 days or
more after the Effective Date. In the case of Additional Services pursuant to
_Section 3.4_ , the Receiving Party shall pay to the Provider such charges as
the parties shall mutually agree and set forth on the Transition Service
Schedules for each of the Services listed therein (unless a particular
Schedule explicitly provides that no charge will be made). In addition, the
Receiving Party shall also pay the Provider any direct third-party costs
associated with providing a service, such as travel lodging. As soon as
practicable after the total number of hours expended in any calendar month
exceeds (i) 2,490 for Services provided pursuant to Schedule 1 hereto or (ii)
1,725 for Services provided pursuant to Schedule 2 hereto, the Provider shall
promptly provide notice to Receiving Party of such fact. As soon as
practicable after such notice is received by Receiving Party, authorized
representatives of Provider and Receiving Party shall meet to discuss further
provision of Services during such calendar month. Unless Receiving Party
approves the expenditure of additional hours, the Provider shall be entitled
to cease providing Services (but only for the balance of such calendar month)
if the continued provision of Services would cause the total number of hours
expended in any calendar month to exceed (i) in the case of Services to be
provided pursuant to Schedule 1, 3,322 hours, and (ii) in the case of Services
to be provided pursuant to Schedule 2, 2,301 hours.



Section 5.2. _Payment Terms_. Provider shall send to the Receiving Party
monthly invoices showing charges pursuant to this Agreement for the
specific Services provided to such Receiving Party. Such invoices shall be
accompanied by reasonable documentation or other reasonable explanation
supporting such charges. Invoices shall be due and payable within 20 days
after receipt and shall be paid in U.S. dollars, and shall be made without
set off of any kind. Late payments shall bear interest at the greater of ten
percent (l0%) or the maximum rate allowed by law.



 

A-4 Section 5.3. _Taxes_. Charges do not include any sales, use, excise, personal
property, customs duty, withholding, value-added or similar tax, fee or
assessment applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereunder,
including without limitation the license, use and/or possession of
intellectual property hereunder (" _Taxes_ "). The Receiving Party shall be
liable for and shall pay any and all such Taxes and related charges, however
designated, excluding taxes based solely on the ProviderÂ’s net income. If any
such Taxes are paid by the Provider, the Receiving Party shall reimburse the
Provider promptly after written notice from the Provider.



ARTICLE VI

GENERAL OBLIGATIONS; STANDARD OF CARE



Section 6.1. _Performance Standards_. A Provider shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Services in accordance with the
policies, procedures and practices in effect before the Effective Date and
shall exercise the same care and skill as it exercises in performing similar
services for itself. In performing its responsibilities hereunder, CTI will
cause each Provider to accord the Receiving Party the same priority as it
provides itself and its Affiliates under comparable circumstances. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the provision of Services, CTI
shall cause each Provider to not discriminate against the Receiving Party or
any of its Affiliates solely because Receiving Party or one of its Affiliates
is the recipient of such Services. CTI shall cause each Provider to
provide Services to the Receiving Party at substantially the same levels of
quality, efficiency and volume as they had been provided to the Business prior
to the date hereof. The Receiving Party shall provide sufficient resources and
timely decisions, approvals and acceptances in order that the Providers may
accomplish their respective obligations hereunder in a timely manner.



Section 6.2. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, NO PARTY
TO THIS AGREEMENT MAKES ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, BUSINESS CONTINUITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH
RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, SOFTWARE OR OTHER DELIVERABLES PROVIDED BY IT
HEREUNDER.



Section 6.3. _Transitional Nature of Services; Changes_. The
Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Services and that the
Provider may make changes from time to time in the manner of performing such
Services if the Provider is making similar changes in performing similar
services for itself;  _provided_ that the Provider furnishes to the Receiving
Party reasonable advanced written notice regarding such changes.



Section 6.4. _Responsibility for Errors; Delays_. Except for Damages arising
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Provider or
its Affiliates in the provision of Services, the ProviderÂ’s sole
responsibility to the Receiving Party with respect to Services are as follows:



(a) for errors or omissions in Services, shall be to furnish correct
information, payment and/or adjustment in the Services, at no additional cost
or expense; _provided_ , the



 

A-5 Receiving Party must promptly advise the Provider of any such error or
omission of which it becomes aware after having used reasonable efforts to
detect any such errors or omissions in accordance with the standard of care
set forth in _Section 6.1_ ; and



(b) for failure to deliver any Service shall be to use reasonable efforts,
subject to _Section 3.3_ , to make the Services available and/or to
resume performing the Services as promptly as reasonably practicable.



Section 6.5. _Good Faith Cooperation; Consents_. (a) The Parties will use good
faith efforts to cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the
provision and receipt of Services. Such cooperation shall include
exchanging information and performing reconciliations and adjustments Unless
otherwise provided in the relevant Transition Services Schedule, the costs of
obtaining any third party consents, licenses, sublicenses or approvals shall
be borne by the Receiving Party for the relevant Services.



(b) The Parties will maintain in accordance with their standard document
retention procedures, documentation supporting the information relevant to
cost calculations contained in the Transition Service Schedules and cooperate
with each other in making such information available as needed in the event
of a tax audit, whether in the United States or any other country.



ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION



Section 7.1. _Termination_. Subject to _Article IV_ hereof, a Receiving Party
may terminate this Agreement, either with respect to all or with respect to
any one or more of the Services provided to it hereunder (including with
respect to any Extended Service Requirement), for any reason or for no reason,
at any time upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Provider.



Section 7.2. _Survival_. _Articles 5_ and  _7.3_ of this Agreement shall
survive termination for the applicable statutes of limitations. _Article XV_
shall survive termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event of any termination with respect to one or more, but less than all
Services, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect
to any Services not terminated.



Section 7.3. _User Identifications, Passwords_. The Parties shall use good
faith efforts at the termination or expiration of this Agreement or
any specific Service to ensure that all copies of user identifications and
passwords that provide any Party with access to another PartyÂ’s premises or
equipment are canceled or destroyed.



ARTICLE VIII

EMPLOYEES

Receiving Party may offer employment to any employees of Providers listed on
any Transition Service Schedules (the "Employees") as may be selected

at least five days notice of its intention to make an offer and the terms and

transfer to Receiving Party of any Employees whom accept Receiving PartyÂ’s
offer of employment.

employment benefits respecting its personnelÂ’s performance of Services under
this Agreement. Each Receiving Party agrees to grant to the ProviderÂ’s
personnel reasonable access to sites, systems and information as necessary for
the Provider to perform its obligations hereunder. Each PartyÂ’s personnel
shall agree to obey any and all security regulations and other published
policies of the other Party relevant to the provision or receipt of the
Services.



ARTICLE XI

SUBCONTRACTORS



A Provider may engage a subcontractor to perform all or any portion of its
duties under this Agreement provided that any such subcontractor agrees in
writing to be bound by confidentiality obligations, and provided further that
the Provider remains responsible for the performance of such subcontractor. As
used in this Agreement, "subcontractor" will mean any individual, partnership,
corporation, firm, association, unincorporated organization, joint venture,
trust or other entity engaged to perform hereunder.

A-13 _Exhibit B_



_Form of Assumption Agreement_



ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made effective as of  _
_, 2005 by and among Cell Therapeutics, Inc., a Washington corporation ("
_CTI_ "), CTI Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (" _Nevada_ " and
together with CTI, " _Sellers_ "), and Cephalon, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Purchaser_ "). The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:



WHEREAS, Sellers and Purchaser entered into an Acquisition Agreement dated as
of June 10, 2005 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Sellers
agreed to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be sold,
conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, to Purchaser all of SellersÂ’
right, title and interest in and to the Assets (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement), in each case all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Acquisition Agreement. Terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings set forth in the Acquisition Agreement.



1.  _Assumption of Liabilities_. For and in consideration of the transfer by
Sellers to Purchaser of the Assets, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, Sellers do hereby
irrevocably convey, transfer and assign to Purchaser all of the Assumed
Liabilities, and Purchaser does hereby irrevocably assume from Sellers and
does hereby agree to pay, perform, discharge or settle (subject to applicable
defenses and setoffs) all of the Assumed Liabilities, provided, however, as
to any lease, contract, agreement, permit or other authorization included in
the Assets which cannot be sold, transferred, assigned, conveyed or delivered
effectively without the consent of a third party, which consent has not been
obtained, this Agreement shall be of no force or effect until such requisite
consent is obtained, whereupon this Agreement shall become of full force and
effect with respect thereto.



2\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_



 

(a) _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the date
hereof, at either SellerÂ’s request and without further consideration
therefor, Purchaser shall execute and deliver to such Seller such other
instruments of assumption, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions, as the parties and their respective counsel shall deem
reasonably necessary to more effectively assume from Sellers the Assumed
Liabilities.



(b) _Conflict with Acquisition Agreement_. Sellers and Purchaser hereby
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall not limit
the full force and effect of the terms and provisions of the Acquisition
Agreement, and that in the event of a conflict between the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the terms and provisions of the Acquisition
Agreement, the terms and provisions of the Acquisition Agreement, shall
prevail, govern and control in all respects without limitation.



(c) _Amendments; Waiver_. The terms, provisions and conditions of this
Agreement may be amended only by agreement in writing of all parties. No
waiver of any provision nor consent to any exception to the terms of this
Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby will be effective unless in
writing and signed by the party to be bound and



 

B-1 then only to the specific purpose, extent and instance so provided. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise or delay in exercising any right
hereunder will be deemed a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise preclude any further or other exercise of such or any other right.



(d) _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of the sections and

_Form of Bill of Sale_



 

BILL OF SALE (this " _Bill of Sale_ ") is made effective as of  _
_, 2005 by and among Cell Therapeutics, Inc., a Washington corporation ("
_CTI_ "), CTI Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (" _Nevada_ " and
together with CTI, the " _Sellers_ "), and Cephalon, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Purchaser_ "). The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:



BACKGROUND



WHEREAS, Sellers and Purchaser entered into an Acquisition Agreement dated as
of June 10, 2005 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Sellers
agreed to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be sold,
conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, to Purchaser all of SellersÂ’
right, title and interest in and to the Assets, in each case all upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Acquisition Agreement.



1\. _Sale_. Sellers do hereby sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to
Purchaser, and Purchaser does hereby purchase, acquire and accept from
Sellers, all of SellersÂ’ right, title and interest in and to the Assets, free
and clear of any and all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances,
provided, however, as to any lease, contract, agreement, permit or other
authorization included in the Assets which cannot be sold, transferred,
assigned, conveyed or delivered effectively without the consent of a third
party, which consent has not been obtained, this Bill of Sale shall be of no
force or effect until such requisite consent is obtained, whereupon this Bill
of Sale shall become of full force and effect with respect thereto.



2\. _Representations_. The representations, warranties, agreements and
indemnities of Seller with respect to the Assets set forth in the
Acquisition Agreement will continue in effect to the extent provided therein
and will not be deemed to be amended, modified, terminated or superseded by or
merged with this Bill of Sale.



3\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.



(a) _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the date
hereof, at PurchaserÂ’s request and without further consideration therefor,
Sellers shall execute and deliver to Purchaser such other deeds, bills of
sale, endorsements, assignments and other good and sufficient instruments of
conveyance and assignment as the parties and their respective counsel shall
deem reasonably necessary to vest in Purchaser all right, title and interest
in, to and under the Assets.



(b) _Conflict with Acquisition Agreement_. Sellers and Purchaser hereby
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Bill of Sale shall
not limit the full force and effect of the terms and provisions of the
Acquisition Agreement, and that in the event of a conflict between the terms
and provisions of this Bill of Sale and the terms and provisions of the
Acquisition Agreement, the terms and provisions of the Acquisition Agreement
shall prevail, govern and control in all respects without limitation.



 

C-1 (c) _Amendments; Waiver_. The terms, provisions and conditions of this Bill of
Sale may be amended only by agreement in writing of all parties. No waiver of
any provision nor consent to any exception to the terms of this Bill of Sale
or any agreement contemplated hereby will be effective unless in writing and
signed by the party to be bound and then only to the specific purpose, extent
and instance so provided. No failure on the part of any party to exercise or
delay in exercising any right hereunder will be deemed a waiver thereof, nor
will any single or partial exercise preclude any further or other exercise of
such or any other right.



(d)  _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of the sections and
subsections of this Bill of Sale are for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this Bill of Sale.



(e) _Counterparts_. This Bill of Sale may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Bill of Sale
may be executed by facsimile signature.



(f) _Successors and Assigns_. This Bill of Sale shall be enforceable against
the successors and assigns of Sellers and Purchaser (as the case may be), and
shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Sellers and
Purchaser (as the case may be).



(g) _Governing Law_. THIS BILL OF SALE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.



(h) _Representation by Counsel; Interpretation_. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Bill of Sale and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document. The provisions of this Bill of Sale will be interpreted
in a reasonable manner to effect the intent of the parties hereto.



(i) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Bill of Sale is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Bill of Sale shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
sale of Assets is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Bill of Sale so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the sale
of Assets is consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.



 

C-2 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Sellers and Purchaser have caused this Bill of Sale to be
duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
