 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " **Agreement** ") is made and entered
into as of December 5, 2016 (the " **Agreement Date** "), by and among
Synchronoss Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **Parent** "), GL
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(" **Merger Sub** "), and Intralinks Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " **Company** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

 



 

B. In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, Parent proposes
to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price per share of Company
Common Stock of $13.00 net to the seller in cash, without interest (such
offer, as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement, the " **Offer** ", and such amount of consideration or any greater
amount per share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, the " **Offer Price**
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

C. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, promptly following the purchase of
Company Common Stock in the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company (the " **Merger** "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share of Company
Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the " **Per Share Merger
Consideration** "), except for (i) shares of Company Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company and (ii) Dissenting Shares.

 



 

D. The board of directors of the Company (the " **Company Board** ") has
unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Tender
Agreements, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " **Transactions** "), (ii) declared that is
in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company that
the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions and that
the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, (iii) declared that the terms of the Offer and the Merger
are fair to the Company and the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent
and its subsidiaries) and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

E. The board of directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared it advisable
for Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and the Tender Agreements and to
consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.

 



 

F. The board of directors of Parent has approved this Agreement, the Tender
Agreements and the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

 



 

G. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of the Company are entering into tender agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " **Tender
Agreements** "), pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders are
agreeing

 



      
 

 



 

to tender their respective shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Tender
Agreements.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE OFFER**

 



 

1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
within 10 Business Days after the Agreement Date, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) the Offer; _provided_ that the Company agrees that no shares
of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any Subsidiary will be
tendered pursuant to the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended from time to time
in accordance with this Agreement, collectively, the " **Offer Conditions**
"). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, at any time, to, in its sole
discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the
terms of the Offer; _provided_ that, except as otherwise permitted herein,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable pursuant to
the Offer, (iii) modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) extend the
Expiration Date or provide a "subsequent offering period" within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, (v) add to the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit A_ or amend any of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ in a
manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, to make any condition to the Offer more onerous) or (vi)
otherwise amend or supplement any term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that all of their respective controlled
Affiliates shall, tender any shares of Company Common Stock held by them into
the Offer.

 



 

(b) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall expire at one
minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the date that is 20 business days
after the commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such time, or such subsequent time to
which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " **Expiration Time** " and such date, or such subsequent date
to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " **Expiration Date** "). Merger Sub may at any time extend the
Offer for any period agreed by Parent and the Company. If on or prior to any
then scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement and Applicable Law, waived by Parent or Merger Sub, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for successive
periods of five Business Days each, in order to permit the satisfaction of
such conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the sole then unsatisfied
condition is the Minimum Tender Condition, Merger Sub shall so extend the
Offer if and only if the Company shall have delivered to Merger Sub a written
request that Merger Sub so extend the Offer (it being agreed that the maximum
aggregate number of days that Merger Sub shall be required to extend the Offer
pursuant to this proviso is 20 Business Days); _provided_ , _further_ , that
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and without the Companys prior written
consent shall not, extend the Offer beyond the

 



      
 

 



 

earlier of the End Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VIII; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Merger Sub shall not
(except as provided in the following sentence), without the Companys prior
written consent, extend the Offer if all conditions to the Offer have been
satisfied. Merger Sub shall, upon prior written notice to the Company, extend
the Offer: (i) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ or NYSE applicable to the
Offer or as required by Applicable Law; and (ii) for one or more periods of
not more than five Business Days each if, at any then scheduled Expiration
Date, the Marketing Period has not expired and the proceeds of the Financing
in the amount of the aggregate Offer Price have not been received by Parent or
Merger Sub as of such Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger
Sub shall not extend the Offer pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence for
more than one Business Day after the date of expiration of the Marketing
Period.

 



 

(c) _Consummation of the Offer; Payment_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, (i) as soon as practicable (and in any event within one Business Day)
after the Expiration Time, accept for payment all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the
time of such acceptance, the " **Offer Acceptance Time** ") and (ii) as soon
as practicable (and in any event within three Business Days) after the Offer
Acceptance Time, pay for all such shares of Company Common Stock (subject to
any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to Section 2.11). Parent shall provide
or cause to be provided to Merger Sub (or to the depositary appointed pursuant
to Section 2.8, on behalf of Merger Sub) on a timely basis the consideration
necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub
accepts for payment pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Offer_. Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the
Offer prior to the Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the
Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article VIII, in which event Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within one Business Day of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall
cause any depositary acting on its behalf to promptly return, all shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer to the registered holders
thereof.

 



 

(e) _Offer Documents_. On the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent
and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " **Schedule TO** "), which shall contain an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other appropriate ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and documents,
together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, collectively,
the " **Offer Documents** "), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by Applicable
Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning the Company required by Applicable Law to be set forth
in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents
to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and all other
Applicable Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders
of the Company, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and as and to
the extent required by Applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from, or material
discussions with, the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall
promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them
and their Representatives, on the

 



      
 

 



 

one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer
Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Board Recommendation.

 



 

1.2. _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements, amendments and
exhibits thereto, the " **Schedule 14D-9** ") containing, subject to Section
6.1, the Company Board Recommendation and a notice of appraisal rights as
contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, which filing shall be made on
the date that the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, and shall mail the
Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent
required by Applicable Law. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to

necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary

251(h) of the DGCL for any reason, then the parties hereto shall take all
actions necessary to cause the consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable following the consummation of the Offer.

 



 

2.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VIII, the closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take place as soon

2.3. _Effective Time_. Promptly following the Closing, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the Secretary

of the DGCL (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware of such filing, or such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, the " **Effective Time**
").

 



 

2.4. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger

Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.5. _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in

officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the respective individuals who
served as the directors and officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. Upon Parents
request, the Company shall exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain a
written letter of resignation from each of the directors and officers of the
Company and from each of the directors and officers of each Subsidiary, which
resignation shall be conditioned upon, and effective as of, the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any officers, any such
resignation shall stipulate that it is only effective as to such individuals
officer position and not with respect to such individuals employment itself.

 



 

2.7. _Effect on Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs_ _,
Unvested Company Shares and_ _Company PSUs_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any party hereto, any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options,
Company RSUs, Company PSUs or any other Person:

 



 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.7(b), but for clarity
including shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to unvested Company
RSUs and Unvested Company Shares that are accelerated immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the operative agreements governing such securities in
effect on the Agreement Date) shall be automatically (A) converted into the
right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.8, an amount of
cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and subject
to any required withholding Tax and (B) cancelled and no longer be deemed
outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any required withholding Tax, upon surrender
of Certificates and/or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with Section 2.8.
For clarity, any Unvested Company Shares which are not accelerated as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be forfeited at such time
pursuant to the terms of the operative agreements governing such Unvested
Company Shares and will not be assumed, substituted or converted by Parent.

 



 

(ii) _Company Options_.

 



 

(A) Each In the Money Option that is vested shall be cancelled and converted
into and represent the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest,
equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In
the Money Option multiplied by (2) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the
exercise price per share of such In the Money Option in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided that the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such amount the amount of
any required withholding Tax. The amount payable pursuant to this Section
2.7(a)(ii)(A) shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for all In the Money Options represented by a
particular grant held by such Person and shall be paid by Parent or its
designee (including the Companys payroll provider) no later than the second
regularly scheduled payroll cycle of Parent following the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(B) Each In the Money Option that is unvested and held by a Continuing
Employee (" **Rollover Option** ") shall, as of the Effective Time, be assumed
by Parent. Each such Rollover Option shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including with respect to vesting), except that (1) such
option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share
eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the Exchange Ratio, (2) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rollover
Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent)
obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such In the Money Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and (3) Parents board of directors or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to the Rollover Options and the Company Option
Plans. It is the intent of the parties hereto that to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, all Rollover Options that prior to the Effective Time were
treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options under the Code shall from
and after the Effective Time continue to be treated as incentive or non-
qualified stock options, respectively, under the Code.

 



 

(C) Each In the Money Option that is unvested and held by a Person other than
a Continuing Employee and each Out of the Money Option shall not be assumed,
substituted or converted by Parent and shall be cancelled and extinguished for
no consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Company_ _RSUs_.

 



 

(A) Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and is held by a Continuing Employee (each, a " **Rollover RSU** "),
shall, as of the Effective Time, be assumed by Parent. Each such Rollover RSU
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (including with respect
to vesting), except that (1) such Rollover RSU shall be settled by the
issuance of that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon settlement of such Rollover RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the next whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional
share eliminated by such rounding) and (2) Parents board of directors or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to the Rollover RSUs and the Company Option
Plans.

 



 

(B) Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and is held by a Person other than a Continuing Employee shall not be
assumed, substituted or converted by Parent and shall be cancelled and
extinguished for no consideration.

 



 

(iv) _Company PSUs_.

 



 

(A) Each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and is held by a Continuing Employee (each, a " **Rollover PSU** "),
shall be assumed by Parent. Each such Rollover PSU shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as are in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to vesting except that (1)
any vesting milestones associated with the trading price of Company Common
Stock will be adjusted to reference the trading price of Parent Common Stock
based on the ratio between the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Parent
Stock Price (as set forth below), (2) such Rollover PSU shall be settled by
the issuance of that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number

 



      
 

 



 

of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon settlement of such
Rollover PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated
by such rounding) and (3) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof
shall succeed to the authority of the Company Board or any committee thereof
with respect to the Rollover PSUs and the Company Option Plans. The adjustment
of vesting milestones associated with the trading price of Company Common
Stock will be adjusted by (1) dividing the Per Share Merger Consideration by
the applicable trading price milestone and (2) dividing the Parent Stock Price
by the quotient obtained in clause (1), with the result being the new trading
price milestone with respect to the Parent Common Stock applicable to the
Rollover PSU.

 



 

(B) Each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and is held by a Person other than a Continuing Employee shall not be
assumed, substituted or converted by Parent and shall be cancelled and
extinguished for no consideration.

 



 

(v) Parent shall register under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or another
appropriate form (and use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness
thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained therein)
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to all Rollover Options,
Rollover RSUs and Rollover PSUs. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery in connection with the
Rollover Options, Rollover RSUs and Rollover PSUs. Parent may in its
discretion elect to assume the Company Option Plans (including any unallocated
pool of shares remaining available for issuance thereunder, as adjusted into
an amount of Parent Common Stock using the Exchange Ratio) and include such
unallocated pool in the Form S-8 registration.

 



 

(vi) Without limiting the rights of any holder of a Company Option, Company
RSU or Company PSU to accelerated vesting or payment of such award under the
terms of such award as in effect on the date hereof and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.7, in the event that the
employment or service of the holder of any Rollover Option, Rollover RSU or
Rollover PSU is terminated (other than for cause) following the Effective Time
and prior to the satisfaction of the vesting condition or conditions
applicable to such award, the Chief Executive Officer of Parent may determine,
in mutual agreement with the Chairman of the Board of Parent, that such holder
shall be deemed to have fully satisfied the applicable vesting condition or
conditions immediately prior to such termination and accordingly shall become
full vested in such award. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section
2.7(a) to the contrary, payments due with respect to the awards described
hereunder shall be made in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the
Code and, in the event that a payment with respect to an award must be made on
a date later than the date described herein in order to avoid the imposition
of an excise tax upon the holder of such award pursuant to the operation of
Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on the earliest date upon
which the payment may be made without resulting in the imposition of such
excise tax.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. At the
Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
without any conversion thereof or payment of any cash or other property or
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of
Merger Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the

 



      
 

 



 

only shares of the Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). From and after the
Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of
Merger Sub common stock will evidence ownership of such number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, all
references to the Offer Price, the Per Share Merger Consideration or to any
specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all
calculations that are based upon such numbers affected thereby, shall be
equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties hereto the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change.

 



 

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if any stockholder of the Company that is entitled to assert appraisal
rights properly demands to be paid the "fair value" of such holders shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the DGCL and complies with all
conditions and obligations of Section 262 of the DGCL, including that such
perfected appraisal rights are not effectively withdrawn or lost, each
Dissenting Share held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall not be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any such demands received by the Company, including any
stockholders notice of their intent to demand payment pursuant to the DGCL
that the Company receives, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii)
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any
Dissenting Shares. If, as of the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to seek appraisal rights, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting
Stockholder shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration in respect of such shares as if such shares never
had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder
thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable
time or times specified in Section 2.8(c), following the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 2.8(c), the amount of cash to which
such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under Section 2.7(a) as if
such shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and all such cash shall be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have become deliverable to such
holder pursuant to Section 2.7(a)).

 



 

2.8. _Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Depositary and Paying Agent_. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company,
LLC (or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or Merger
Sub), shall act as the depositary in connection with the Offer and as the
paying agent (the " **Paying Agent** ") in connection with the Merger.

 



 

(b) _Deposit of_ _Cash_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent to, deposit with the
Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article II the aggregate
amount of cash payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a) ( _provided_ that the cash
payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i) or Section 2.7(a)(ii)(A) may instead be
paid directly by either Parent

 



      
 

 



 

through its payroll provider or, if so directed by Parent, by the Surviving
Corporation through its payroll provider).

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail,
promptly following the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (" **Certificates** ") and each holder of record
of book-entry shares (" **Uncertificated Shares** ") that, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates
surrendered therewith shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall contain such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use of such letter of
transmittal in effecting surrender of Certificates and/or Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the cash payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, or upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
appropriate agents message in the case of book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, each holder of such Certificate or such Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash
amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.7(a) in
respect of the Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate or such
Uncertificated Shares, and the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive the cash payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a), except
as provided in Section 2.7(e).

 



 

(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or otherwise in connection with the Merger.

 



 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
2.7(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall, as applicable, be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it the amount of any transfer or other Taxes required to be paid
under Applicable Law by reason of the payment of cash in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.8 to the
contrary, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Paying Agent that has
not been delivered to any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Article II within twelve months after the Effective Time
shall promptly be paid to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares who has not theretofore complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 2.8(c) shall look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for its
claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash payable to
such holder pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares have not been
surrendered prior to the date on which the cash payment contemplated by
Section 2.7(a) in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity, any
amounts payable in respect of such

 



      
 

 



 

Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall, from and after the day preceding
such date and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

2.9. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash paid or
payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be so paid or payable in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

2.10. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be required
pursuant to Section 2.7(a) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate; _provided_ that Parent or the Paying Agent
may, in its respective discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond in
such sum as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent and/or any of their respective Representatives with respect
to such Certificate.

 



 

2.11. _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of any shares of Company
Capital Stock, any Company Options, any Company RSUs, any Unvested Company
Shares, any Company PSUs, any Certificates or any Uncertificated Shares such
amounts as any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, in
its reasonable discretion, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any other Applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances will Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent deduct or withhold any amount under
Section 1445 of the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld and remitted amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered
and paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

 



 

2.12. _Tax Consequences_. Neither the Company nor Parent makes any
representations or warranties in this Agreement to any holder of any shares of
Company Capital Stock, any Company Options, any Company RSUs, any Unvested
Company Shares, or any Company PSUs regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger,
or any Tax consequences to the Company or any such holder arising in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions.
Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that Parent and the Company are
relying solely on their respective Tax advisors in connection with the
Transactions.

 



 

2.13. _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes hereof and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on
behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action necessary or
desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts, except to the extent
inconsistent with this Agreement.

(A) Subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure letter of the
Company delivered to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** ") that correspond to the
representations and warranties set forth in this Article III (each of which
exceptions, in order to be effective, shall indicate the Section and, if
applicable, the subsection of this Article III to which it corresponds (unless
the relevance of such disclosure to other representations and warranties set
forth in this Article III is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosed
exception, in which case such disclosed exception shall be deemed so
applicable to such other representations and warranties set forth in this
Article III)) and (B) except as disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC by the Company and publicly available prior to
the Agreement Date (without giving effect to any amendment thereof filed with
or furnished to the SEC on or after the Agreement Date and excluding any
disclosures set forth therein to the extent they constitute general
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements (including under the
captions "Risk Factors", "Forward-Looking Statements" or "Management

also excluding any trends regarding, or other extrapolations or predictions
of, future financial condition or results that may be derived from historical
financial information or disclosures under the caption "Management Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", but it being
understood that this clause (B) shall not be applicable to Section 3.1,
Section 3.2 or Section 3.3), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1. _Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary is an
entity that is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation (except, in
the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does not recognize such
concept), except in the case of the Subsidiaries where the failure to be so
organized, exist or be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate with
any such other failures, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary has the requisite
power to own its properties and to conduct the Business and is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (to
the extent the concept is recognized by such jurisdiction) where the nature of
its business requires such qualification or licensing, except where the
failure to have such power or to be so qualified and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate with any such other failures, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
is not in violation in any material respect of any of the provisions of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, each as in effect on the Agreement
Date.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy
of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other equivalent
organizational or governing documents, as applicable, of the Company and each
Subsidiary that is a "significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 12b-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Company, in each case as amended
through the Agreement Date. No such Subsidiary is in violation in any material
respect of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or equivalent organizational or governing documents, in each case as in effect
as of the Agreement Date. Schedule 3.1(b) sets forth a true, correct and
complete list, as of the Agreement Date, of such Subsidiaries and their
respective jurisdictions of organization or formation. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (in any jurisdiction that
recognizes such concepts), are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary
(except for de minimis equity interests held by another person as required

clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and are not
subject to any preemptive right or right of first refusal, other than in favor
of the Company or a Subsidiary, created by statute, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other equivalent organizational or governing
documents, as applicable, of such Subsidiary or any Contract to which the
Company or such Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound. There are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, "put" or "call" rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other Contracts to which the Company
or any Subsidiary is party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound
with respect to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of
any Subsidiary, or otherwise obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or sell any such
securities, including any stockholder rights plans, "poison pill" anti-
takeover plans or other similar devices. Other than the Subsidiaries, the
Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in,
or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any Person. There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries under any Contract to which it is a party
or by which it is bound to make any equity or other investment (in the form of
a capital contribution or otherwise) in, any other Person (other than the
Company or a Subsidiary) in an amount in excess of $150,000 in respect of any
single Person.

and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, assuming the
conditions of Section 251(h) of the DGCL have been satisfied with respect to

Company or any other corporate proceeding on the part of the Company is
necessary to adopt or authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to
Section 2.3). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by
each of the other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject only to the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy and other
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and (ii) Applicable
Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted on or prior to the

modified or rescinded) by the unanimous vote of the full Company Board, has
(i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Tender Agreements, and
the Transactions, (ii) declared that is in the best interests of the Company
and the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent and its subsidiaries)
that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions and

Board Recommendation** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Assuming the conditions of Section 251(h) of the DGCL have been satisfied
with respect to the Merger, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i)
result in the creation of any material Encumbrance on any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any consent, approval
or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (A) any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational or governing
documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as amended to date,
(B) any Applicable Law or Company Authorization or (C) any Material Contract,
other than, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) of this Section 3.3(b), such
conflicts, violations, defaults, Encumbrances, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, losses, consents, approvals or waivers, individually or in the
aggregate, as would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) No consent, approval, order, authorization, release or waiver of, or
registration, notification, declaration or filing with, any Governmental

rules and regulations of NYSE and (v) such other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, releases, waivers, registrations, notifications, declarations
or filings that, if not obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.4, the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by the
Company Board constitute all of the approvals that are necessary to render the
restrictions on "business combinations" with "interested stockholders" set
forth in Section 203 of the DGCL (as such terms are defined therein)
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions, and represent the only
action necessary to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL does not and will not
apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions. No other state takeover or similar statute
or regulation is applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

3.4. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

with the SEC since January 1, 2014. All such required forms, statements,
schedules, reports and documents, as supplemented, modified or amended since
the time of filing, are referred to herein as the " **Company SEC Reports**."
As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (i) complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Agreement Date, then on the
date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of the Subsidiaries is subject to the
periodic and current reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (collectively,
the " **Financial Statements** "), at the time filed (i) complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in conformity with GAAP
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q,
Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the respective dates therein indicated and
the consolidated results of the Companys and the Subsidiaries operations and
cash flows for the periods therein specified (subject, in the case of
unaudited interim period financial statements to the absence of footnotes and
to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments, none of which individually or
in the aggregate are material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole). The balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2016 (the "
**Company Balance Sheet Date** ") contained in the Company SEC Reports is
hereinafter referred to as the " **Company Balance Sheet**." Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liabilities except for: (i) Liabilities
reflected on, accrued on or reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet in
accordance with GAAP, (ii) Liabilities incurred since the Company Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
(iii) Liabilities incurred under executory Contracts to which the Company or a
Subsidiary is a party, other than as a result of a breach thereunder, (iv) the
fees and expenses of investment bankers, attorneys, consultants and
accountants incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions,
(v) Liabilities contemplated or expressly permitted by this Agreement and (vi)
Liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as reflected in the
Company SEC Reports, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to, nor
does it have any obligation or other commitment to become a party to, any
material "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or such Subsidiary in the
Company SEC Reports. From March 4, 2016 through the Agreement Date, the
Company has not had any material dispute with any of its auditors regarding
accounting matters or policies. There has been no change in the Companys
accounting policies from January 1, 2014 through the Agreement Date, except as
described in the Financial Statements.

 



 

(c) From March 4, 2016 through the Agreement Date, the SEC has not provided

money or involving letters of credit as of the Agreement Date individually
involving a principal amount in excess of $1,000,000, including, for each item
of Company Debt, the Contract governing such Company Debt.

 



 

(e) The Company has established and maintains and has since January 1, 2014
maintained, disclosure controls and procedures as defined in and required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) which is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the Company Board; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. As of the Agreement Date, there
are no "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the
Companys internal controls and procedures that have been identified by the
Companys auditors and would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. To
the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2014 to the Agreement Date,
neither the Company nor the Companys independent registered accountant has
identified or been made aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the management or other employees of the Company who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

3.5. _Absence of Certain Changes_. From the Company Balance Sheet Date to the
Agreement Date, (i) except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Subsidiaries have
conducted the Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice,
except in connection with the Transactions or other potential strategic
transactions and (ii) there has not occurred a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

or any Subsidiary or any of their respective assets or properties or any of
their respective directors, officers or employees (in their capacities as such
or relating to their employment, services or relationship with the Company or
any Subsidiary), in each case except as would not, individually, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
As of the Agreement Date, there is no Order against the Company or any
Subsidiary, any of their respective assets or properties or, to the knowledge

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
material Legal Proceeding pending against any other Person. To the knowledge
of the Company, there has not been since January 1, 2014 to the Agreement
Date, any internal investigations, reviews or inquiries being conducted by the
Company, the Company Board (or any committee thereof), any compliance officer
of the Company or person performing this function, any human resources
representative, any lawyer or any third Person at the request of any of the
foregoing concerning any financial, accounting, Tax, conflict of interest,
illegal activity, fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or
malfeasance issues that would, individually, be material to the Company and

material assets or properties or (ii) that is required for the operation of
the Business or the holding of any such interest (all of the foregoing
consents, licenses, permits, grants and other authorizations, collectively,
the " **Company Authorizations** "), and all of the Company Authorizations are
in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain such Company
Authorizations or the failure of such Company Authorizations to be in full
force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance in
all material respects with the terms of the Company Authorizations. To the
knowledge of the Company and except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
since January 1, 2014, the Company has not received any written notice from
any Governmental Entity regarding (A) any actual or alleged violation of any
Company Authorization or any failure to comply in all material respects with
any term or requirement of any Company Authorization or (B) any revocation,
withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification of any

business for or with, or directing business to, any Person or (B) in a manner
that would constitute or have the purpose or effect of public or commercial
bribery, acceptance of or acquiescence in extortion, kickbacks or other
unlawful or improper means of obtaining business or any improper advantage.
Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers
or employees (acting in their capacities as such) has been convicted of
violating any Anti-Corruption Law or, to the knowledge of the Company,

Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
the corporate power to own its properties and to conduct its business as now
being conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction (to the extent the concept is recognized by
such jurisdiction) where the nature of its business requires such
qualification or licensing, except where the failure to have such power or to
be so qualified and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate with
any such other failures, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation in any
material respect of any of the provisions of its articles or certificate of
incorporation, as applicable, or bylaws, each as in effect on the Agreement
Date.

 



 

4.2. _Authority; Non-contravention_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceeding on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to adopt or authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the Transactions (other than the adoption of this Agreement
by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which shall occur promptly
following the execution of the Agreement). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
subject only to the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy and other
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and (ii) Applicable
Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any
consent, approval or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (i) any provision of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub, in each
case, as amended to date, (ii) subject to compliance with the requirements set
forth in Section 4.2(c), any material Applicable Law applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective material properties or assets or (iii)
any material Contract applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), such
conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations,
losses, consents, approvals or waivers, individually or in the aggregate, as
would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parents or Merger Subs
ability to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) No consent, approval, order, authorization, release or waiver of, or
registration, notification, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity, is required by, or with respect to, Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant
to Section 2.3, (ii) such filings and notifications as may be required under
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Law

the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Law, (iii) such other filings
and notifications as may be required under federal, state or foreign
securities laws or the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market, (iv) the filing of a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC
after the Closing Date covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Rollover Options, Rollover RSUs and Rollover PSUs to be
assumed and converted by Parent and (iv) such other consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, releases, waivers, registrations, notifications,
declarations or filings that, if not obtained or made, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially alter or
materially delay any of the Transactions.

 



 

4.3. _No Prior Merger Sub Operations_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of effecting the Transactions and has not engaged in any business
activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with the
Transactions.

 



 

4.4. _Stock Ownership_. As of the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub beneficially own any shares of Company Capital Stock. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub, nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates," has been an
"interested stockholder" with respect to the Company at any time within the
three-year period ending on the Agreement Date, as those terms are used in
Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



 

4.5. _Information Supplied_. The Offer Documents and the information supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule
14D-9, including any amendments or supplements thereto, shall not, on each
applicable filing date and date of mailing to the stockholders of the Company,

Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by the Company that is contained in (or incorporated by
reference in) the Offer Documents.

 



 

4.6. _Litigation_. As of the Agreement Date, there is no Legal Proceeding
pending before any Governmental Entity or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing against Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
assets or properties or any of their respective directors, officers or
employees (in their capacities as such or relating to their employment,
services or relationship with Parent or Merger Sub), in each case except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the Agreement Date, there is no Order
against Parent or Merger Sub, any of their respective assets or properties or,
to the knowledge of Parent, any of their respective directors, officers or
employees (in their capacities as such or relating to their employment,
services or relationship with Parent or Merger Sub), in each case except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.7. _Brokers and Advisors_. Except for Parents obligation to PJT Partners LP
and Goldman, Sachs and Co., neither the Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent is
obligated for the payment of any fees or expenses of any investment banker,
broker or finder in connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of
this Agreement or in connection with the Merger or any other Transaction, and
the Company and its Affiliates will not incur any Liability, either directly
or indirectly, to any investment banker, broker, advisor or similar party as a
result thereof or of any act or omission of Parent, any of its stockholders,
any of its subsidiaries or any of its Representatives.

 



 

4.8. _Financing_.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Parent will have available to it upon the consummation of the Offer and
the Effective Time sufficient funds to make the payments required pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to, the Offer and the Merger, respectively.

 



 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the fully
executed debt commitment letters from the Financing Sources identified
therein, dated as of the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto (and together with any fee letter (each, a "
**Fee Letter** ") associated therewith which Fee Letter has been redacted in a
customary manner solely with respect to terms that are confidential and do not
adversely affect the enforceability, availability or conditionality of or the
aggregate amount of net proceeds available under the Financing) as of the date
of this Agreement, collectively, the " **Debt Commitment Letters** "),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, such
Financing Sources have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " **Financing** "). All of the Debt Commitment Letters are in
full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization and similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no Debt Commitment Letter has been
withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or
modified, in any respect, and (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, no such
withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated (other than any such amendment, modification or
supplement to add Financing Sources, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters
as of the date hereof). As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of Parent
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other Person under any of the Debt
Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to
believe (both before and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letters) that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely
basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms or
conditions to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letters are
satisfied (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period).
As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts, arrangements or understandings to which Parent is a party related
to the funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Financing is subject to no conditions to the
obligations of the parties under the Debt Commitment Letters to make the full
amount of the Financing available to Parent or Merger Sub at the Closing other
than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or
deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute
all of the financing required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and are sufficient in amount to provide Parent
with the funds necessary for it to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, including for
Parent to pay the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to Article II and the
payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees, costs and
expenses relating to the Financing.

 



 

4.9. _Parent Contracts_. As of the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor any of
its subsidiaries is a party to or bound by a Contract with any third Person
for the acquisition by Parent, whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase
of assets, tender offer or otherwise, of the business of any third Person
which, either directly or through one or more of its subsidiaries, is a
provider of software or software-as-a-service solutions.

 



      
 

 



 

4.10. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub are Solvent as of the date of
this Agreement, and, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each of the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries will, after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing and the
payment of the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to Article II and the
payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees, costs and
expenses relating to the Financing), be Solvent at and after the Closing.

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

6.1. _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Change of Recommendation_. Subject to Section 6.1(c)
and Section 6.1(d), during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company (including the
Company Board and any committee thereof) and the Subsidiaries will not, and
they will not authorize any of their respective Representatives (collectively,
the " **Company Representatives** ") to, and the Company shall exercise
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the
making, submission or public announcement of any inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain
or continue any communications or negotiations regarding, or deliver or
knowingly make available to any Person any non-public information with respect
to (and for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly facilitating or
encouraging), any unsolicited inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (other than informing Persons of the provisions set forth
in this Agreement or contacting any Person making any inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer to ascertain facts or clarify terms and conditions
for the sole purpose of the Company Board reasonably informing itself about
such inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer; _provided_ , that
substantive discussions and negotiations regarding such inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer may only be effected pursuant to Section 6.1(c)),
(iii) (A) agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose
or announce any intention or desire to agree to, accept, approve, endorse or
recommend) any Acquisition Proposal, (B) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify (or publicly propose or announce any intention or desire to withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval of the Company Board of this Agreement and/or any of the Transactions
or the Company Board Recommendation, (C) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, or (D) fail to send to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, within 10
Business Days after a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the
Company shall have been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent and the
Company, a statement disclosing that the Company unconditionally recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer (any action or failure described in
this clause (iii), a " **Change of Recommendation** "), (iv) enter into any
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, letter of intent,
acquisition agreement or other contract (whether binding or not) with respect
to any Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) or (v) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company
shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the other Company Representatives to, immediately cease any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted prior to or on the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date
(and in any event within two Business Days), the Company shall request, and
use reasonable best efforts to cause (to the extent provided for by the
applicable confidentiality agreement), any Person (and such Persons
Representatives) with which the Company has engaged in any such activities
within the 12-month period preceding the Agreement Date to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information previously provided to such Person (and
such Persons Representatives) and terminate access to any physical or
electronic data rooms relating to a potential Acquisition Transaction. The
Company shall not (and shall not permit any Subsidiary to) waive

 



      
 

 



 

or forbear in the enforcement of any standstill provisions of any Contract to
which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party; _provided_ that the Company
shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and forbear in the enforcement of, any
such standstill provision to the extent that (x) such provision would
otherwise prohibit the counterparty thereto from making an inquiry, indication
of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a negotiated Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company
Board shall have concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable
Law.

 



 

(b) _Notice_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall advise Parent
orally and in writing as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 48
hours) after receipt by the Company (and/or to the knowledge of the Company,
by any of the Company Representatives) of (i) any inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for non-public
information (including access to any of the properties, books or records of
the Company or any Subsidiary) that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall describe the material terms and
conditions of such inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request
and the identity of the Person or Group submitting any such inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, request or offer. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status and material
details of, and any material amendments or modifications to, any such inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, offer or request and any material
correspondence or communications related thereto, and shall provide to Parent
as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours after receipt)
a true, correct and complete copy of all written and other materials and
information provided to the Company, a Subsidiary and/or, to the knowledge of
the Company, a Company Representative in connection with any such inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal, offer or request (including any material
amendments or modifications or proposed material amendments or modifications),
or a reasonable written summary thereof if such material or information is not
written. The Company shall not enter into any Contract with any Person that
prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with this Section 6.1(b).

 



 

(c) _Superior Proposals_. In the event that any Person or Group submits to the
Company (and does not withdraw) an unsolicited, written, _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal prior to the consummation of the Offer that did not
result, directly or indirectly, from a breach of Section 6.1(a) and the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of national standing) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or Group prior to such
conclusion to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and solely to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal), then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 6.1(a), the Company may (i) enter into
discussions or negotiations with such Person or Group and parties to the
Tender Agreements regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) deliver or make
available to such Person or Group non-public information regarding the Company
and the Subsidiaries and afford access to the business, employees, officers,
contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to the Person or Group who made such Acquisition Proposal and
such Persons or Groups Representatives; _provided_ that, in each such case,
(A) the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under Applicable Law, (B) prior to making available to any such Person any
material non-public information, the Company first shall have received from
such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (C) the Company
shall provide Parent written notice of such actions within one Business Day of
taking any such action in clause (i) or (ii) above and (D) prior to or
substantially

 



      
 

 



 

contemporaneously with delivering or making available any such non-public
information to such Person, the Company shall deliver or make available such
non-public information to Parent.

 



 

(d) _Change of Recommendation for Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in Section 6.1(a), the Company Board may effect a
Change of Recommendation following the satisfaction of all of the following
conditions:

 



 

(i) the Offer has not been consummated;

 



 

(ii) (A) an Acquisition Proposal that did not result, directly or indirectly,
from a breach of Section 6.1(a) has been submitted to the Company and has not
been withdrawn, (B) the Company shall have complied in all material respects
with its obligations under Section 6.1 with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, and (C) the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(iii) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ") that stated expressly
(A) that the Company has received such Superior Proposal, (B) the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
or Group submitting such Superior Proposal and (C) that the Company Board
intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner and timing in
which it intends to do so;

 



 

(iv) the Company has, during the four Business Day period referred to in
Section 6.1(d)(iii), if requested by Parent, made Company Representatives
reasonably available to discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parents
Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent desires to propose
such that such Superior Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal;

 



 

(v) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on the fourth day of such four Business Day period in a manner
that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have
determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such changes were to be given effect; and

 



 

(vi) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (following consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior Proposal and
any modifications proposed by Parent, the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

 



 

If the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal are
materially amended, the Company will deliver to Parent a new notice, and the
period of negotiation provided in the foregoing sentence shall in no event end
prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the second Business Day following
Parents receipt of such new notice, but no such new notice shall shorten the
original notice period; _provided_ , that the Companys obligations set forth
in this Section 6.1(d) shall apply only with respect to the first such
amendment of an Acquisition Proposal, regardless of any subsequent amendment
or modification thereto; _provided further_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in each instance where the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
lowers the proposed price included in such Acquisition Proposal or amends such
Acquisition Proposal other than with regard to price in a manner materially
adverse to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent a new notice, and
a new two Business Day period and negotiation process shall apply under this
Section 6.1(d). For clarity, all references to four Business Day periods in
this Section 6.1(d) shall be deemed to refer to two Business Day periods with
respect to the subsequent negotiation periods referenced in this paragraph.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Change of Recommendation for Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in Section 6.1(a), the Company Board may effect a
Change of Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any Change of Recommendation proposed to be
made in response to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of Section 6.1(d)) following the satisfaction of
all of the following conditions:

 



 

(i) the Offer has not been consummated;

 



 

(ii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that, in light of material facts, events and/or
circumstances that have developed since the Agreement Date which were
previously unknown by the Company and which were not reasonably foreseeable as
of the Agreement Date (an " **Intervening Event** ") and taking into account
the results of any discussions with Parent as contemplated by subsection (iii)
below and any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (iv) below, the
failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company stockholders under
Applicable Law; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
such Intervening Event result in and of itself from a change in the trading
price of the Company Common Stock (however, the underlying reasons for such
changes may constitute an Intervening Event);

 



 

(iii) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice that the Company Board intends to make a Change of
Recommendation (" **Notice of Intervening Event** ") and if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have made the Company Representatives reasonably
available during the four Business Day period to discuss with Parents
representatives (to the extent Parent desires to discuss) (A) the facts,
events and circumstances underlying such proposed Change of Recommendation and
the Company Boards reason for proposing to effect such Change of
Recommendation and (B) any modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that the Parent desires to propose that that would obviate the need
for the Company Board to effect such Change of Recommendation; and

 



 

(iv) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such four Business Day period) offer that the Company Board concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of national standing) would obviate the need for the Company Board to
effect such Change of Recommendation, it being agreed that (A) the Company
Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly
following the receipt thereof, (B) the Company Board will not effect a Change
of Recommendation for four Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice
of Intervening Event, and (C) any material change in the facts, events or
circumstances related to the Intervening Event shall require a new Notice of
Intervening Event to Parent and a new two-Business Day period and discussion
process under subsection (iv) above (and all references to four Business Day
periods in this Section 6.1(e) shall be deemed two-Business Day periods for
purposes of this clause (C)).

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company that the Company Board has concluded in good faith
(following consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law or (iii) issuing a "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation or

 



      
 

 



 

make or authorize any disclosure which would reasonably be expected to have
the same effect as a Change in Recommendation, except in each case in
accordance with Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.1(e). For the avoidance of doubt,
a factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal, that no position has been taken by the Company Board
as to the advisability or desirability of such Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Change
of Recommendation.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated below:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " means any agreement, offer, proposal or
indication of interest (other than this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any other offer, proposal or indication of interest by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries), or any public announcement of intention to enter into any such
agreement or of (or intention to make) any offer, proposal or indication of
interest, relating to an Acquisition Transaction.

 



 

(ii) " **Acquisition Transaction** " means any transaction, or series of
related transactions (other than the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction involving Parent or any of its subsidiaries), involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase by any Person or Group, directly or indirectly, of 20%
or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or any securities
of any Subsidiary or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person or Group beneficially owning 20% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company, (B) any merger, consolidation,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any
Subsidiary pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold securities representing 80% or less of the
outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction (or parent entity of such surviving or resulting entity), (C) a
sale or other disposition in a transaction or series of transactions by the
Company or the Subsidiaries of assets representing (i) 20% or more of the
aggregate fair market value of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries
or (ii) 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, consolidated net income
or consolidated book value of the Company and the Subsidiaries immediately
prior to such transaction or series of transactions, or (D) any liquidation or
dissolution of the Company, or any extraordinary dividend, whether of cash or
other property, by the Company.

 



 

(iii) " **Superior Proposal** " means, with respect to the Company, an
unsolicited, bona fide written offer submitted after the Agreement Date and
prior to the consummation of the Offer by a third Person or Group with respect
to an Acquisition Transaction (with all percentages in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction changed to 50%) that the Company Board has concluded
in good faith (following consultation with its outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of national standing), taking into account, among other
things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the
offer, including conditions to consummation and the Person making the offer,
would be, if consummated, more favorable to the stockholders of the Company
(in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of the Offer and the
Merger (after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

6.2. _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period: (i) the Company shall, upon reasonable
advance written request from Parent, afford Parent and its Representatives

Subsidiary and (B) all other information concerning the Business, results of
operations, product development efforts, properties

 



      
 

 



 

(tangible and intangible, including Intellectual Property Rights) and

personnel of the Company and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere

shall maintain the virtual data room established in connection with this
Agreement and promptly provide to Parent and its Representatives access

of the Company and each Subsidiary in the Companys or such Subsidiarys
possession; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case the Company shall not
be required to provide such access or documents to the extent it determines
that providing such access or documents would (x) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third Person entered into
prior to the Agreement Date (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third Person to
such access or disclosure); (y) result in the loss of any attorney-client
privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or provision of documents in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (z) violate any Applicable
Law (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate
Applicable Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any
disclosure to Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.2 to
the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to any Legal
Proceeding in respect of which the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties. With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this Section
6.2, Parent shall comply with, and shall instruct Parents Representatives to
comply with, all of its obligations under the confidentiality letter
agreement, dated as of September 21, 2016, by and between the Company and
Parent (as may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the
" **Confidentiality Agreement** ").

Section 6.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or condition contained herein.

 



 

6.3. _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) Except with respect to any Change of Recommendation or announcement made
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or related matters in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, or any dispute between the parties hereto
regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and shall give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably
conclude may be required by (i) Applicable Law, (ii) in connection with any
required filings under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign Antitrust Law
to report the Transactions or (iii) court process or by obligations pursuant
to any rule of or listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be
in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this Section
6.3(b) shall limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are consistent in all
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

6.4. _Efforts to Consummate_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its respective reasonable best efforts, and to cooperate
with each other party hereto to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, appropriate or
desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, including (i) taking, or causing to be taken,
all actions, and doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to satisfy the Offer Conditions and the
conditions set forth in Article VII and consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, authorizations, orders,
exemptions or waivers by any third Person, the failure of which to so obtain
would be materially adverse to the ability of the company to consummate the
Transactions at or prior to the End Date ( _provided_ that in respect of
Contracts between the Company or any of the Subsidiaries with any third
Person, none of the parties hereto shall be required to make or agree to make
any payment or accept any material conditions or obligations unless such
payment, condition or obligation is contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger).

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereto
agree to (A) make an appropriate and complete filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby within 10 business days following the date of this
Agreement (" **Merger Notification Filings** "), (B) as reasonably promptly as
practicable, make all other required or advisable filings required by any
Applicable Law that is designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " **Antitrust Laws** ") with respect to the transactions
contemplated, and (C) not to delay or consummate the extension of any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the Federal Trade
Commission (the " **FTC** ") or the United States Department of Justice (the "
**DOJ** ") or any other Governmental Entity, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. Each of Parent and the Company shall
supply as reasonably promptly as practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust law and use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law as
soon as possible. The parties hereto shall promptly supply one another upon
request with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings or obtain such consents and approvals. Each party hereto shall (i)
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating
to any Antitrust Law, (ii) coordinate with one another in preparing and
exchanging such materials and (iii) promptly provide each other party hereto
(and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions
(and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such first party to any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ ,
that with respect to any such analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals or such filings, presentations or
submissions, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its
counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the
extent that any Applicable Law requires such party or its subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such information. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other (or the
others respective advisors) copies of all correspondence between such party
and any Governmental Entity relating to the Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate
any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section
6.4 as "outside counsel only," it being understood that all filings provided
pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall be provided on an "outside counsel only"
basis unless otherwise designated by the party providing such material. Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside
counsel of the recipient and will not be

 



      
 

 



 

disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions,
telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall include representatives of
all parties.

 



 

(c) Each party hereto will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of (i)
any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with
any Merger Notification Filings made pursuant hereto, (ii) any request by any
officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any
Merger Notification Filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any Applicable Law and (iii) any
proposal by a Governmental Entity regarding a settlement of any investigation.
Each party hereto will respond promptly to and comply with any request for
information relating to this Agreement or the Merger Notification Filings from
any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering or
investigating any Antitrust Laws. Whenever any event occurs that is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any Merger Notification
Filing made pursuant to Section 6.4(b), each party hereto will promptly inform
the other parties of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Parent
and the Company shall take any and all of the following actions to the extent
necessary to cause the expiration of the notice periods under Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions and to obtain the approval of any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any Applicable
Law regarding the Transactions: (i) entering into negotiations, (ii) providing
information required by Applicable Law and (iii) substantially complying with
any "second request" for information pursuant to Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(e) If any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is
expressly understood and agreed that Parent and the Company will take any and
all reasonable steps not prohibited by Applicable Law to avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the End Date,
including defending through litigation any claim asserted in any court with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ
or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party under any
Antitrust Law and including by using its reasonable best efforts to pursue all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be under any obligation to make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to Orders providing for
(i) the sale, license or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets
of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) the
imposition of any limitation or restriction on the ability of Parent or any of
its Affiliates to freely conduct their business or, following the Closing, the
Business or own such assets or (iii) the holding separate of the shares of
Company Capital Stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent
or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Capital Stock, (any of the foregoing, an " **Antitrust Restraint** ")
in each of (i) through (iii) if any such action would be material to the
combined business of Parent and the Surviving Corporation following the
Closing (any such non-material action being an " **Excluded Antitrust
Restraint** "); _provided further_ , _however_ that, at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not
to, enter into any definitive Contract with any third Person for the
acquisition by Parent or any such subsidiary, whether by merger, purchase of
stock, purchase of assets,

 



      
 

 



 

tender offer or otherwise, of the business of any third Person which, either
directly or through one or more of its subsidiaries, is a provider of software
or software-as-a-service solutions if doing so could, as determined based on
consultation with outside antitrust counsel, reasonably be expected to
materially increase the likelihood of any Legal Proceeding described in clause
(e) or an Antitrust Restraint (other than an Excluded Antitrust Restraint).
Nothing in this Section 6.4(f) shall require the Company or any of it its
subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit a partys right to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) so long as such party has until such date
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.4.

 



 

6.5. _Notice of Certain Matters_. The Company shall notify Parent in writing
promptly after obtaining knowledge of any Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity being initiated by or against it, or known by the Company
to be threatened against the Company or any of its directors or officers in
their capacity as such, or of any written correspondence from any Person
asserting or threatening a claim against the Company or with respect to any of
its assets or properties, in each case to the extent such Legal Proceeding is
related to this Agreement or the Transactions, and the Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the
status thereof. No notification given pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements herein
or affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent.

 



 

6.6. _Labor Matters_. From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to, honor all obligations to
any labor union, works council or other labor organization until such
obligations otherwise expire and, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the terms and conditions of employment upon and after the
Closing for all employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of the
Subsidiaries represented by a labor union, works council or other labor
organization in connection with their employment by the Surviving Corporation
or any of the Subsidiaries shall be governed by any such obligations to such
labor union, works council or other labor organization.

 



 

6.7. _Other Employee_ _Matters_.

 



 

(a) On or about the date that is five Business Days prior to the expected date
on which the Closing will occur, the Company shall deliver to Parent a revised
list of each Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder), each agreement the Company reasonably believes would give rise to
non-deductibility under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code and calculations
prepared by a firm retained by the Company showing the estimated liability
under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP in order to shorten each purchase and/or offering period under
the Company ESPP that extends beyond the Effective Time (the " **Current
Offerings** ") such that a new purchase date for each such Current Offering
shall occur prior to the Effective Time and shares may be purchased by
participants in the Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time. The Company ESPP
shall terminate immediately prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and
(ii) the date upon which the Company ESPP terminates by its terms. Following
the Agreement Date, the Company shall not commence any new purchase and/or

 



      
 

 



 

offering periods under the Company ESPP. Effective as of not later than
immediately preceding the Effective Time, the Company shall have terminated
the Company ESPP and shall have provided such notices of termination as may be
required by the terms of the Company ESPP.

 



 

(c) During the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each individual
employed by the Company or a Subsidiary as of the Closing Date (each, a "
**Company Employee** "), for so long as the Company Employee remains so
employed by the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of Parent, at
least the same base salary and the same target annual bonus opportunity
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the contractual or plan-based obligations of the Company
or any Subsidiary, Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a
termination of employment during the one year period immediately following the
Closing Date with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits to which such employee would have been entitled with
respect to such termination under the severance policies of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if
greater, the severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent.

 



 

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company
Employees full credit for such Company Employees service with the Company for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits
(including for purposes of severance, but not for purposes of benefit accruals
under defined benefit pension plans) under any benefit plans maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which a Company Employee participates
to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service. For the one-year period commencing
immediately following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each Company Employee with vacation benefits
substantially similar to such benefits as are provided to any employee of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries of similar tenure to such Company Employee,
including by giving full credit in respect of vacation accrual for such
Company Employees years of service to the Company.

 



 

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees
and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates that provides health benefits in which Company Employees
participate following the Closing, other than any limitations that were in
effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing Date under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan; (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and
out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior
to the Closing Date during the portion of the calendar year prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums under health plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they
are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred;
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the
extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Employee Plan prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee
of the Company to continued employment by Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any

 



       
 

 



 

employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to continue any Company Employee Plans or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Closing Date; (iii) confer upon
any Company Employee any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement; or (iv) be treated as an amendment to any particular employee
benefit plan of Parent or the Company.

 



 

(h) The Company shall give all notices and other information required to be
given to the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary under any Applicable
Law in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

6.8. _Equity Spreadsheet_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
prepare and deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing, a spreadsheet
containing the following information as of the Closing Date (to the extent in
the Companys possession and reasonably necessary to calculate the treatment
of equity awards pursuant to Section 2.7): (i) the names of all holders of
Company Options and Company RSUs, their respective addresses and where
available, taxpayer identification numbers and whether they are then providing
services as employees or as contractors to the Company or the Subsidiaries,
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company Options
and Company RSUs, (iii) the exercise price per share in effect for each
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iv) the vesting
status, amounts and schedule with respect to each Company Option and each
Company RSU held by each holder thereof (including the vesting commencement
date) and (v) the Tax status of each Company Option under Section 422 of the
Code (or any applicable foreign Tax scheme). The Company shall deliver to
Parent a draft of the Equity Spreadsheet containing such of the foregoing
information as is available to the Company after complying with the first
sentence of this Section 6.8, not later than two Business Days prior to the
proposed date of the Closing.

 



 

6.9. _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Unless Parent provides written notice to
the Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated, the Company
shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliates, in each case, effective as of the day immediately preceding
the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The Company
shall provide Parent with proposed draft of resolution of Company Board
terminating the 401(k) plan for review of Parent prior to effecting such
termination and evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board
or the board of directors of its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable.

 



 

6.10. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to, fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries to their respective current and former directors, officers and
employees, including those serving at the request of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries as a director or officer or in another capacity of another Person
(including those individuals serving in any such capacity prior to the
Effective Time) (collectively, the " **Covered Persons** ") pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company or such Subsidiary made available
to Parent and any exculpation, indemnification or advancement provisions under
the Companys or such Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) as in effect on the Agreement Date with
respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company
or such Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case,
subject to Applicable Law. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to advancement of
expenses, exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable in
each case to the Covered Persons as those contained

 



      
 

 



 

in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company (or equivalent
organizational documents) as in effect on the Agreement Date, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that adversely affects the rights
thereunder of the Covered Persons, unless such modification is required by
Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director and
officer of the Company and the Subsidiaries, including those serving at the
request of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as a director or officer or
in another capacity of another Person (including those individuals serving in
any such capacity prior to the Effective Time) (each such person, an "
**Indemnified Party** "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements (" **Losses** "), incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the
Transactions), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary as a director
or officer of another Person at any time at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only
to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such
person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter. The foregoing obligations
in this Section 6.10(b) shall expire six years from the Effective Time
(provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any proceeding
asserted or made within such proceeding shall continue until the final
disposition of such proceeding).

 



 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall either maintain in effect for the benefit of
the Indemnified Partieswith respect to their acts and omissions as directors
and officers of the Company or any Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Agreement Date
in the form made available by the Company to Parent prior to the Agreement
Date (the " **Existing D andO Policy**"), or provide substitute policies for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties of not less than the existing coverage and
having other terms not less favorable to the insured Persons than the Existing
DandO Policy, to the extent that directors and officers liability insurance
coverage is commercially available. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company shall be permitted, at its option, to purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, such
"tail" policies to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing
coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured Persons
than the Existing DandO Policy. The Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any such substitute or
"tail" policies) in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the most recently
paid annual premium for the Existing DandO Policy (the " **Maximum Premium** ").
Subject to the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
any such substitute or "tail" policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder. In the event any future annual premiums
for the Existing DandO Policy (or any such substitute or "tail" policies) exceed
the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall

 



      
 

 



 

be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or
any such substitute or "tail" policies) to the amount of coverage that can be
obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.10.

 



 

6.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
(to the extent permitted under Applicable Law) to cause any disposition of
Company Capital Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Capital Stock) or acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
Transactions by each Company Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP. " **Company Insiders** " means those individuals who are subject to
the reporting requirement of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company.

 



 

6.12. _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all action reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Transactions.

 



 

6.13. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company will not, on or after the date hereof and prior to
the consummation of the Offer, enter into, establish, amend or modify any
plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid
or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any
former, current or future director, officer, employee, consultant, advisor or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary (or any Person who
would have assumed such role or performed such duties but for a requirement to
refrain from assuming such role or performing such duties in such plan,
program, agreement or arrangement) unless, prior to such entry into,
establishment, amendment or modification, the compensation committee of the
Company Board (each member of which shall be an "independent director" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be
necessary to (i) approve as an employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement
and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. The Company shall, prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, take such actions it determines to be necessary or appropriate to
ratify, confirm and approve, in accordance with and for the purpose of Rule
14d-10 under the Exchange Act, compensation paid or payable to any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, consultant, advisor or
independent contractor of the Company under any Company Employee Plan or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

6.14. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use, their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions (including any "flex" provisions) described in the Debt Commitment
Letters, including executing and delivering all such documents and instruments
as may be reasonably required thereunder and using (and causing its
subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Financing and the Debt Commitment
Letters;

 



 

(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to
the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters (the " **Financing Agreements** ");

 



 

(iii) satisfy, or cause their respective Representatives to satisfy, as
promptly as practicable and on a timely basis all conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters that are within its control
(including by paying any commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by
any fee letters relating to the Debt Commitment Letters);

 



 

(iv) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent the failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the
amount or timing of the Financing (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) or the availability of the Financing prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time;

 



 

(v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent that
the failure to enforce would adversely impact the amount or timing of the
Financing (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or
the availability of the Financing at the Offer Acceptance Time; and

 



 

(vi) cause the Financing Sources and any other Persons providing Financing to
fund the Financing no later than the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
termination, modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any
condition, remedy or other provision under any Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendment, supplement, termination, modification, replacement or waiver would
or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing from that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters delivered as
of the date hereof to an amount such that the transactions contemplated hereby
could not be consummated, (ii) impose any new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner that would (x) delay or prevent the Offer or (y) make
the funding of any portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of any condition
to obtaining any portion of the Financing) less likely to occur or (iii)
adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Financing Agreements (it being understood and agreed that, in any event,
Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement). Upon any amendment,
supplement, modification or replacement of, or waiver of, any Debt Commitment
Letter in accordance with this Section 6.14(b), Parent shall promptly deliver
a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to "Debt Commitment
Letters" shall include and mean such documents as amended, supplemented,
modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this Section 6.14(b), and
references to "Financing" shall include and mean the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or
waived in compliance with this Section 6.14(b), as applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the event that all or any portion of the Financing becomes or could
reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters
for any reason or any of the Debt Commitment Letters shall be withdrawn,
terminated, repudiated or rescinded for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly
notify the Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to, alternative financing from the same or alternative sources (the "
**Alternative Financing** ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or replace any unavailable
portion of the Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter
(including any associated engagement letter and related Fee Letter) with
respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the " **New Debt
Commitment Letter** "), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company; provided, that Parent shall not be required to obtain Alternative
Financing on terms and conditions that are materially less favorable, taken as
a whole, to Parent than those in the Debt Commitment Letters (including any
"flex" provisions) that such Alternative Financing and New Debt Commitment
Letter would replace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Alternative Financing
or New Debt Commitment Letter may expand upon the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date as set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters in effect on the date hereof or otherwise
include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that would reasonably be
expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative Financing would be funded
less likely. In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained and a New Debt
Commitment Letter is entered into in accordance with this Section 6.14(c),
Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to
(A) "Debt Commitment Letters" shall be deemed to include and mean the Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (B) "Financing" shall
include and mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the preceding clause (A). Upon the
commencement of the Marketing Period, Parent shall give written notice thereof
to the Company.

 



 

(d) Parent shall furnish the Company substantially final drafts (when
available) and true and complete and executed (upon execution) copies of the
Financing Agreements upon the reasonable request of the Company. Parent shall
(i) give the Company prompt written notice of any default or breach by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements of
which Parent becomes aware, if such default or breach would result in a delay
of, or in any way limit, the availability of the Financing and (ii) otherwise
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing (or any Alternative Financing). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of the
receipt or delivery of any notice or other communication, in each case from
any Person with respect to (x) any actual or potential default under or breach
of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements by
Parent, or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission or
threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission thereof by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or (y) any
dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment
Letters or Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Offer Acceptance
Time, in each case, that would make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur or delay the availability of the Financing, and (B) if at any time for
any reason Parent believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from
the sources, contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing
Agreements or will be unable to obtain Alternative Financing. Parent shall
promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating
to any circumstance referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing
or any alternative financing, nor the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing or any alternative financing, is a condition to
the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, or the completion
of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set forth on
_Exhibit A_.

 



 

6.15. _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall and shall cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to, at
Parents sole expense, use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to
provide such cooperation in connection with arranging, obtaining and
syndicating the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent as is
necessary and customary in connection with the arrangement of financings
similar to the Financing; _provided_ that such requested cooperation is
consistent with Applicable Law and does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. Such
cooperation by the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company shall include,
in each case at the reasonable request of Parent:

 



 

(i) preparing and furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources, not later than

with the Financing,

 



 

(ii) causing the Companys senior officers to participate in a reasonable
number of lender meetings, rating agency presentations and due diligence

(v) reasonably cooperating with Parents legal counsel in connection with
customary legal opinions required in connection with the Financing,

 



 

(vi) reasonably assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family
ratings from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters,
including assisting Parent and the Financing Sources in the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations solely with respect to

(vii) reasonably assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive Financing Agreements and other customary financing
documents, including guarantee and collateral documents and other certificates
and documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing (including
delivery of original stock certificates and original stock powers of the
Subsidiaries to the extent required on the Closing Date in connection with the
Financing and to the extent available to the Company),

 



 

(ix) using reasonable best efforts to assist the Financing Sources in
benefiting from the existing lending relationships of the Company,

 



 

(x) taking all ministerial company actions, subject to and only effective upon
the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit
the consummation of the Financing,

 



 

(xi) at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all
documentation and other information about the Company and the Subsidiaries as
is reasonably requested in writing by Parent at least ten Business Days prior
to the Closing in connection with the Financing that relates to applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including
without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, and

 



 

(xii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary payoff letters and

therein as lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and
collateral agent and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as lead arranger and sole
bookrunner, as amended to date and (ii) the Credit Agreement, dated as of
February 24, 2014, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
lender, as amended to date.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or enter into any binding agreement or
commitment or incur any other actual or potential liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing) that is not
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, (B) no director, manager, officer or
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to
deliver any certificate or take any other action pursuant to this Section
6.15(a) to the extent any such action would reasonably be expected to result
in personal liability to such director, manager, officer or employee, (C) none
of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their
respective directors or officers shall be obligated to adopt resolutions or
execute consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing (or
any alternative financing), provided that this clause (C) shall not prohibit
the adoption or execution of any resolutions or consents effective no earlier
than the Closing Date by any persons that shall remain or will become officers
or directors of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company as of
the Effective Time, and (D) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company shall be required to take any action that would reasonably be
expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, to conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any Applicable Law, any contract or
obligations of confidentiality (not created in contemplation hereof) binding
on the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company. The Company hereby consents
to the use of the Companys and the Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing in an form and manner mutually agreed in advance with the Company;
_provided, however_ , that such logos are used solely in an manner that is not
intended, or reasonably likely, to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely
affect the Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company,

the Financing or any Alternative Financing and any information supplied or
provided in connection therewith (except to the extent suffered or incurred as
a result of (i) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of
this Agreement by the Company, any Subsidiary or any Representative thereof,
in each case as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) any
inaccuracy (other than any immaterial inaccuracy) in the historical financial

and the Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
direct or indirect equity holders, general or limited partners, controlling
persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holder, general or limited partner, controlling person,
stockholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate or
assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " **Company Related
Parties** ") and any Person who pays the Termination Fee on the Companys
behalf for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related
Parties or any Person who pays the Termination Fee on the Companys behalf
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(g) In circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable in accordance
with Section 8.3(c), other than for reimbursement and indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 6.15(b), the Companys receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee (if received) from Parent shall be the Companys and its
controlled Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract,
tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Applicable
Law or otherwise) against Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, general or limited partners, controlling persons,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holder, general or limited partner, controlling person, stockholder,
member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate or assignee of
any of the foregoing (collectively, the " **Parent Related Parties** ") and
the Financing Source Related Parties for all losses and damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or under the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing
Agreements or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent
Related

 



      
 

 



 

Parties or Financing Source Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions
or the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements.

headings contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation hereof.

this Agreement shall be rounded to the 10th decimal place, except in respect
of payments, which shall be rounded to the nearest whole United States cent.

 



 

9.5. _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Law and Section 1.1, the parties
hereto may amend this Agreement by authorized action at any time pursuant to
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

waiver or termination of Section 8.3(c), Section 8.3(g), Section 9.8, Section
9.12(b), Section 9.14 and this sentence of Section 9.5 (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such

counterpart. The delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF format
of this Agreement with all executed signature pages (in

 



      
 

 



 

counterparts or otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to
the terms and conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will

and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all Exhibits, and the Company Disclosure
Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of
this Agreement, in accordance with its terms, and (ii) are not intended to
confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder (except that (x) Section
6.10 is intended to benefit the Covered Persons and Indemnified Parties and
(y) the provisions of Section 8.3(g), the final sentence of Section 9.5, this
Section 9.8, Section 9.12(b) and Section 9.14 are intended to be for the

obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
or delegation without such prior written consent shall be null and void,
except that Parent and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights and/or delegate its
obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of any other party hereto;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding any such assignment, Parent and/or Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

9.10. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

9.11. _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right
to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions hereof
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the
parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in
connection with the remedies described herein. However, the Company shall only
be entitled to enforce specifically Parents or Merger Subs obligation to
consummate the Offer or the Merger subject to the following requirements: (i)
with respect to the Offer, the conditions set forth in Annex I have been
satisfied or waived; (ii) with respect to the Merger, the conditions set forth
in Article VII have been satisfied or waived and remain satisfied or waived at
the time when the Closing would

 



      
 

 



 

have otherwise occurred in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2; and
(iii) the Financing has been funded or would be available to be funded at the
Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing
Agreements, assuming, and provided there is, no breach by the Lenders
thereunder that has occurred and is continuing. Nothing in the foregoing
sentence shall be construed to restrict any right of the Company to
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations
other than with respect to consummation of the Offer and the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the election of
the Company to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from seeking
to terminate this Agreement and seeking to collect the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.3(c) or damages for liability of Parent or Merger Sub as
provided in Section 8.2; _provided_ that, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive (x) both a grant of specific
performance to cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer and the
Merger, on the one hand, and payment of any such damages or payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand or (y) both payment of any such
damages, on the one hand, and payment of the Parent Termination Fee, on the
other hand.

that the Company may be required to issue upon conversion, settlement or

exercising holders) (the " **Minimum Tender Condition** ");

 



 

(ii) at or prior to the Expiration Time, all applicable waiting periods (and

effect and that (I) provides for an Antitrust Restraint (other than an
Excluded Antitrust Restraint) or (II) otherwise prohibits, enjoins or makes
illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or causes the Offer or
the Merger to be rescinded and (B) there shall not be pending by any
Governmental Entity any litigation that would reasonably be expected to result
in one of the foregoing;

 



 

(iv) as of immediately prior to the Expiration Time, (A) the representations
and warranties of the Company in Section 3.1(a) (with respect to the Company
only), Section 3.2(a), the first sentence of Section 3.3(d), Section 3.3(a),
clause (ii) of Section 3.5 and Section 3.15(b) shall be true and correct in
all respects on and as of the Agreement Date and on and as of the Expiration
Date as though such representations and warranties were made on and as of such
date (except for representations and warranties that address matters only as
to a specified date, which representations and warranties shall be true and
correct with respect to such specified date); _provided_ that this condition
shall be satisfied with respect to the representations and warranties made in
Section 3.2(a) where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to
result in additional cost to the Company, Parent and their Affiliates,
individually or in the aggregate, of more than $9,000,000; (B) the
representations and warranties of the Company in the second sentence of
Section 3.3(d) and Section 3.15(a) shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the Agreement Date and on and as of the Expiration Date

(except for such representations and warranties that address matters only as
to a specified date, which representations and warranties shall be true and
correct with respect to such specified date); and (C) all other
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement, disregarding
all qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification,
shall be true and correct on

      
 

 



 

and as of the Agreement Date and on and as of the Expiration Date as though
such representations and warranties were made on and as of such date (except
for representations and warranties that address matters only as to a specified
date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct with
respect to such specified date), except where the circumstances causing the
failure of such representations or warranties to be true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(v) the Company shall have performed and complied in all material respects
with all covenants and other agreements in this Agreement required to be
performed and complied with by it at or prior to the Expiration Time;

 



 

(vi) as of immediately prior to the Expiration Time, since the Agreement Date,
there shall not have occurred and be continuing a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

 



 

(vii) as of immediately prior to the Expiration Time, Parent shall have
received a certificate, signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company, to the effect that each of
the conditions specified in subparagraphs (iv), (v) and (vi) is satisfied (the
" **Certification Condition** ");

 



 

(viii) as of immediately prior to the Expiration Time, appraisal rights shall
not have been demanded or exercised pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
DGCL in respect of more than 28.4% of the Company Common Stock outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Expiration Time; and

 



 

(ix) as of immediately prior to the Expiration Time, the Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with its terms and the Offer shall not have
been terminated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

 



 

The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Tender
Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Any reference in this _Exhibit
A_ or in the Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be
deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this _Exhibit A_
shall have the meaning ascribed to them elsewhere in the Agreement.

This **TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT** , dated as of December 5, 2016 (this "
**Agreement** "), is among Synchronoss Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" **Parent** "), GL Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger Sub** "), and
(" **Company Stockholder** ").

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date of this Agreement, Company Stockholder is the
holder of record or "beneficial owner" (as defined under Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) of [*] shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("
**Company Common Stock** "), of Intralinks Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " **Company** ") (such shares of Company Common Stock
together with any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by Company
Stockholder after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date, "
**Subject Shares** "); _provided_ that Company Options, Company RSUs and
Company PSUs beneficially owned by Company Stockholder (" **Subject Options**
", " **Subject RSUs** " and " **Subject PSUs** ", respectively, and together
with Subject Shares, " **Subject Securities** ") shall not be considered
"Subject Shares" prior to their exercise or settlement, and shares of Company
Common Stock issued upon exercise of Subject Options or settlement of Subject
RSUs or Subject PSUs shall be considered "Subject Shares"; _provided further_
, that Unvested Company Shares beneficially owned by Company Stockholder shall
not be considered "Subject Shares" for purposes of Section 1.1 hereof if the
Company has not granted appropriate waivers, consents or approvals to permit
Company Stockholder to tender such Unvested Company Shares in the Offer.

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " **Merger Agreement** "; capitalized terms used herein without definition
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement),
pursuant to which, among other things, (a) Merger Sub will commence a tender
offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such
offer as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by the Merger
Agreement, the " **Offer** "), and (b) following the consummation of the
Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " **Merger**
"), with the Company being the surviving corporation, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , each of Parent and Merger Sub has required, as a condition to
its willingness to enter into and perform its obligations under the Merger
Agreement, that Company Stockholder enter into this Agreement, and Company
Stockholder has agreed to do so in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into, and in consideration of its entering into, the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT TO TENDER_**

 



 

1.1 _Agreement to Tender_.

 



 

(a) Company Stockholder agrees that as promptly as practicable after the
commencement of the Offer, and in any event no later than the tenth Business
Day following the commencement of the Offer, Company Stockholder shall validly
and irrevocably tender into the Offer

      
 

 



 

(and deliver any certificates evidencing the Subject Shares, to the extent
that any are in certificated form) all Subject Shares, free and clear of all
claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests of any nature whatsoever
that would prevent Company Stockholder from tendering the Subject Shares in
accordance with this Agreement or otherwise complying with Company
Stockholders obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ that if Company
Stockholder has not received the Offer Documents within such ten Business Day
period following the commencement of the Offer, Company Stockholder shall so
tender the Subject Shares within five Business Days following receipt of the
Offer Documents. If Company Stockholder acquires any Subject Shares after the
tenth Business Day following the commencement of the Offer, Company
Stockholder shall validly tender into the Offer (and deliver any certificates
evidencing such Subject Shares, to the extent that any are in certificated
form) such Subject Shares within five Business Days following the date that
Company Stockholder acquires such Subject Shares.

 



 

(b) Company Stockholder agrees that once the Subject Shares are tendered into
the Offer, Company Stockholder shall (i) promptly notify Parent that such
Shares have been tendered and (ii) prior to the Termination Date, not withdraw
the tender of such Subject Shares unless the Offer shall have been terminated
or withdrawn prior to the scheduled expiration time in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement or the Offer shall have expired unconsummated,
or the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or the Merger Agreement is terminated
prior to the purchase of the Subject Shares in the Offer, Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub to return, all the Subject Shares tendered by Company
Stockholder in the Offer to Company Stockholder.

 



 

1.2 _Agreement to Vote_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Company
Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, until the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, at any
annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called,
including any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any
action proposed to be taken by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company, Company Stockholder shall, in each case to the fullest extent that
Subject Shares are entitled to vote thereon: (a) appear at each such meeting
or otherwise cause all such Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat
for purposes of determining a quorum and (b) be present (in person or by
proxy) and vote (or cause to be voted), or deliver (or cause to be delivered)
a written consent with respect to, all of such Subject Shares (i) against any
action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure
of any of Offer Conditions to be satisfied and (ii) against any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Transaction and against any other action, agreement or
transaction involving the Company that is intended, or would reasonably be
expected, to impede, interfere with or prevent the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or the other Transactions. Company Stockholder shall retain at
all times the right to vote all Subject Shares in Company Stockholders sole
discretion, and without any other limitation, on any matters other than those
set forth in this Section 1.2 that are at any time or from time to time
presented for consideration to the Companys stockholders generally;
_provided_ that Company Stockholder complies with the terms of this Section
1.2.

Company Stockholder covenants and agrees as follows:

operation of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (including any claim
seeking to enjoin or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Closing) or

breach) in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Transactions, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Company Stockholder hereby waives any rights of
appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger that Company Stockholder may

such other securities of the Company or (c) any securities issued in
replacement of, or as a dividend or distribution on, or otherwise in respect
of, shares of Company Common Stock or such other securities (collectively, "
**Additional Securities** "), the terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
of such Additional Securities as though owned by Company Stockholder on the
date of this Agreement (other than with respect to representations and
warranties that speak as of a specified date), and Company Stockholder shall
notify Parent in writing, promptly following such acquisition, of the number
and type of any and all

 



      
 

 



 

such Additional Securities. In the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
merger, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or
the like of the capital stock of the Company on, of or affecting any Subject
Securities, then this Agreement shall apply to such securities immediately
following the effectiveness of any such event.

 



 

4.6 _Documentation and Information_. Company Stockholder (a) consents to, and
authorizes, the publication and disclosure by Parent and its affiliates of its

required by the SEC or other Governmental Entity, the Offer Documents or any
other disclosure document in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions and (b) shall promptly provide Parent with any
information it may reasonably request for the preparation of any such
disclosure documents. Company Stockholder agrees to promptly notify Parent of
any required corrections with respect to any written information supplied by
it specifically for use in any such disclosure document, if and to the extent
that any shall have become false or misleading in any respect.

 



 

4.7 _Public Announcements_. Company Stockholder shall not issue any press
release or make any other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement without the prior
written consent of Parent, except as such release or statement may be required
by Applicable Law.

 



 

4.8 _No Solicitation_. Subject to Section 6.3 hereof, Company Stockholder
hereby agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate
or knowingly facilitate or encourage the making, submission or public
announcement of an Acquisition Proposal or (b) enter into, participate in,
maintain or continue any communications or negotiations regarding a potential
Acquisition Proposal with any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company (other than informing Persons of the provisions set forth in the
Merger Agreement). Company Stockholder shall immediately cease any discussions
or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in
this Agreement, Company Stockholder or any of its controlled affiliates or
representatives shall not be prohibited from participating in any discussions
or negotiations with respect to a possible tender and support, voting or
similar agreement in connection with an Acquisition Proposal in the event that
the Company is permitted to take the actions set forth in Section 6.1(c) of
the Merger Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

4.9 _No Groups_. Company Stockholder agrees that, without the prior written
consent of Parent, it shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not
to, become a member of a "group" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) of the

securities of the Company for the purpose of opposing or competing with the
Offer or the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

5.1 _Termination_. This Agreement and the covenants and agreements set forth
in this Agreement shall terminate automatically (without any further action of
the parties) upon the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) a Change of Recommendation
effected in compliance with the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Effective Time,
(iv) the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub (or other affiliate of Parent)
of the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer
and not properly withdrawn, (v) upon mutual written consent of the parties to
terminate this Agreement, and (vi) the date of any modification, waiver or
amendment of the Merger Agreement in a manner that reduces the amount or
changes the form of consideration payable thereunder to Company Stockholder
(the date of such termination being referred to herein as the

 



      
 

 



 

"Termination Date"). In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Article V, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability on the part of any party; provided that this Article V and Article
VI shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, further that no
such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

6.1 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation and effect, by the laws of the state of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed and to be performed wholly within such state without giving
effect to the choice of law principles of such state, except for the
provisions of this Agreement that relate expressly to the DGCL, which shall be
construed, performed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the
DGCL.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court for the purpose of any action or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement, (b) hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or if
that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington,
Delaware, in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense in any Legal Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such Legal Proceeding may
not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof
may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such Legal Proceeding shall be heard and determined
in such courts., (c) consents to the service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 6.7 and (d)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any
court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle
County, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware, and irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and
agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or if that court does
not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware or that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company Stockholder hereby irrevocably
waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or Company Stockholder in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this
Agreement.

 



 

6.2 _Specific Performance_. Company Stockholder agrees that irreparable damage
would occur and that Parent would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without posting bond or other
security, and without the necessity of proving actual damages, in any federal
court located

 



      
 

 



 

in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which Parent is entitled at law or in equity. These
injunctive remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and
remedies Parent may have under Applicable Law.

 



 

6.3 _Stockholder Capacity_. Company Stockholder enters into this Agreement
solely in its capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the Subject
Securities. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the rights and
obligations of Company Stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or in Company Stockholders capacity as a trustee or
fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust, or in any other capacity
whatsoever.

 



 

6.4 _No Ownership Interest_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or
Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or
with respect to any Subject Securities. All rights, ownership and economic
benefits of and relating to the Subject Securities shall remain vested in and
belong to Company Stockholder.

 



 

6.5 _Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole
or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties without
the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent or Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence
shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as giving any Person, other than the parties hereto and their heirs,
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any right, remedy or
claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

 



 

6.6 _Amendments, Waivers, etc_. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof
may be amended other than by an instrument in writing signed by Parent, Merger
Sub and Company Stockholder. No provision of this Agreement may be waived,
discharged or terminated other than by an instrument in writing signed by the
party against whom the enforcement of such waiver, discharge or termination is
sought, except that this Agreement may be terminated as set forth in Article
V. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 



 

6.7 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any party
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered either

invalid, illegal, incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, or unenforceable for any reason, it shall

 



      
 

 



 

be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of
the parties hereto to the maximum extent possible. In any event, the
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder
of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement, including that provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the terms of
this Agreement remain as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



 

6.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and

Agreement.

without further consideration, Company Stockholder shall execute and deliver
or cause to be executed and delivered such additional documents and
instruments and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or
desirable to effect the matters contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement, Company Stockholder covenants, agrees and acknowledges that
he, she or it shall in no event have any recourse whatsoever under this
Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this
Agreement against any of Parents present or former directors, executive
officers, employees, or Affiliates (collectively, the " **Related Parties**
"), whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on or otherwise be incurred by any of the Related Parties for any obligation
or liability of Parent under this Agreement, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or liabilities
or their creation.

 



 

6.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission, electronic mail in PDF form or by any other electronic
means designed to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a

A Delaware Corporation

 



 

 , 2017

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **STOCKHOLDERS**

 



 

 **Section 1.1: _Annual Meetings_** **. **Unless directors are elected by
written consent in lieu of an annual meeting, as permitted by Section 211 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (" ** _DGCL_** "), an annual meeting of
stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date and time
as the Board of Directors shall each year fix. The meeting may be held either
at a place, within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote
communication as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may determine.
Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

 



 

 **Section 1.2: _Special Meetings_** **. **Special meetings of stockholders
for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of
Directors, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President, or by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors. Special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.

 



 

 **Section 1.3: _Notice of Meetings_** **. **Notice of all meetings of
stockholders shall be given in writing or by electronic transmission in the
manner provided by law (including, without limitation, as set forth in Section
7.1(b) of these Bylaws) stating the date, time and place, if any, of the
meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the " ** _Certificate of
Incorporation_** "), such notice shall be given not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder
of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

 



 

 **Section 1.4: _Adjournments_** **. **The chair of any meeting of
stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the
meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The chair shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting to another time, date and place (if any). Any
meeting of stockholders may adjourn from time to time, and notice need not be
given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place (if any)
thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30)
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, then a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned
meeting the Corporation may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting.

 



 

 **Section 1.5: _Quorum_** **. **At each meeting of stockholders the holders
of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present
in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business, except if otherwise required by applicable law. If a
quorum shall fail to

 



      
 

 



 

attend any meeting, the chairperson of the meeting or the holders of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by
proxy, at the meeting may adjourn the meeting. Shares of the Corporations
stock belonging to the Corporation (or to another corporation, if a majority
of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other
corporation are held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation), shall
neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or
any other corporation to vote any shares of the Corporations stock held by it
in a fiduciary capacity and to count such shares for purposes of determining a
quorum.

 



 

 **Section 1.6: _Organization_** **. **Meetings of stockholders shall be
presided over by such person as the Board of Directors may designate, or, in

in the absence of such person, the President of the Corporation, or, in the
absence of such person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by
proxy, at the meeting. Such person shall be chairperson of the meeting and,
subject to Section 1.11 hereof, shall determine the order of business and the
procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting
and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The

a meeting of stockholders, or to take corporate action by written consent
without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy. Such a proxy may be prepared, transmitted and delivered
in any manner permitted by applicable law. Voting at meetings of stockholders
need not be by written ballot unless such is demanded at the meeting before
voting begins by a stockholder or stockholders holding shares representing at
least one percent (1%) of the votes entitled to vote at such meeting, or by
such stockholders or stockholders proxy; _provided_ , _however_ , that an
election of directors shall be by written ballot if demand is so made by any
stockholder at the meeting before voting begins. If a vote is to be taken by
written ballot, then each such ballot shall state the name of the stockholder
or proxy voting and such other information as the chairperson of the meeting
deems appropriate and, if authorized by the Board of Directors, the ballot may
be submitted by electronic transmission in the manner provided by law.
Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, every matter other than the
election of directors shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon that are present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and are voted for or against
the matter.

 



 

 **Section 1.8: _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_**
**. **In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or to take corporate action by written consent without a meeting, or
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less
than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60)
days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of
Directors, then the record date shall be as provided by applicable law. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or

 



      
 

 



 

to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

 



 

 **Section 1.9: _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_** **. **A complete
list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged
in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be open to
the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,

hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is
held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any
stockholder who is present at the meeting. If the meeting is held solely by
means of remote communication, then the list shall be open to the examination
of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access the list
shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

 



 

 **Section 1.10: **_Action by Written Consent of Stockholders_.

 



 

(a) _Procedure_. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents are in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed in the manner permitted by
law by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Written
stockholder consents shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who
signs the consent in the manner permitted by law and shall be delivered to the
Corporation as provided in subsection (b) below. No written consent shall be
effective to take the action set forth therein unless, within sixty (60) days
of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner
provided above, written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders
to take the action set forth therein are delivered to the Corporation in the
manner provided above.

 



 

(b) _Electronic Transmission_. A telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a
stockholder or proxyholder, or a person or persons authorized to act for a
stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated
for the purposes of this section, provided that any such telegram, cablegram
or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information
from which the Corporation can determine (i) that the telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or
proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or
proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or
authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or
electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram, cablegram or
electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which
such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such
consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a Corporations registered office
shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents
given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise
delivered to the principal

 



      
 

 



 

place of business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Consent_. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action by
stockholders without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of the
stockholders shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented
thereto in writing and, who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would
have been entitled to notice of the meeting, if the record date for such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation as required by
law. In the case of a Certificate of Action (as defined below), if the DGCL so
requires, such notice shall be given prior to filing of the certificate in
question. If the action which is consented to requires the filing of a
certificate under the DGCL (the " ** _Certificate of Action_** "), then if the
DGCL so requires, the certificate so filed shall state that written
stockholder consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL
and that written notice of the taking of corporate action by stockholders
without a meeting as described herein has been given as provided in such
section.

 



 

 **Section 1.11: **_Inspectors of Elections_.

 



 

(a) _Applicability_. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of

authorized for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation system of a
registered national securities association; or (iii) held of record by more
than two thousand (2,000) stockholders. In all other cases, observance of the

the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Appointment_. The Corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of
stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting

no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at
the meeting.

 



 

(c) _Inspector s Oath_. Each inspector of election, before entering upon the
discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such
inspectors ability.

 



 

(d) _Duties of Inspectors_. At a meeting of stockholders, the inspectors of
election shall (i) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting
power of each share, (ii) determine the shares represented at a meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv)
determine and retain for a reasonable period of time a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and
(v) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the
meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint
or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the
performance of the duties of the inspectors.

 



 

(e) _Opening and Closing of Polls_. The date and time of the opening and the
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
a meeting shall be announced by the inspectors at the meeting. No ballot,
proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, shall be

Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Determinations_. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any
envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in connection
with proxies in accordance with Section 212(c)(2) of the DGCL, ballots and the
regular books and records of the Corporation, except that the inspectors may
consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling
proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their
nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a
proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the
stockholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable
information for the limited purpose permitted herein, the inspectors at the
time they make their certification of their determinations pursuant to this
Section 1.11 shall specify the precise information considered by them,
including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when
the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained
and the basis for the inspectors belief that such information is accurate and
reliable.

than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
and to the extent authorized in this Section 6.2.

 



 

(1) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than By or In the Right of the
Corporation_. Each Director and Officer shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Corporation against any and all Expenses and Liabilities that are
incurred or paid by such Director or Officer or on such Directors or
Officers behalf in connection with any Proceeding or any claim, issue or
matter therein (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation),
which such Director or Officer is, or is

 



      
 

 



 

threatened to be made, a party to or participant in by reason of such
Directors or Officers Corporate Status, if such Director or Officer acted in
good faith and in a manner such Director or Officer reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or the Predecessor,
as applicable, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

 



 

(2) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings By or In the Right of the Corporation_.
Each Director and Officer shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation against any and all Expenses that are incurred by such Director or
Officer or on such Directors or Officers behalf in connection with any
Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein by or in the right of the
Corporation, which such Director or Officer is, or is threatened to be made, a
party to or participant in by reason of such Directors or Officers Corporate
Status, if such Director or Officer acted in good faith and in a manner such
Director or Officer reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation or the Predecessor, as applicable; provided,
however, that no indemnification shall be made under this Section 6.2(a)(2) in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Director or Officer
shall have been finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of
Chancery or another court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine
upon application that, despite adjudication of liability, but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such Director or Officer is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnification for such Expenses that such court deems
proper.

 



 

(3) _Survival of Rights_. The rights of indemnification provided by this
Section 6.2 shall continue as to a Director or Officer after he or she has
ceased to be a Director or Officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives.

 



 

(4) _Actions by Directors or Officers_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Corporation shall indemnify any Director or Officer seeking indemnification in
connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director or Officer only if
such Proceeding (including any parts of such Proceeding not initiated by such
Director or Officer) was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, unless such Proceeding was brought to enforce such Officers
or Directors rights to indemnification or, in the case of Directors,
advancement of Expenses under these Bylaws in accordance with the provisions
set forth herein.

 



 

 **Section 6.3: _Indemnification of Non-Officer Employees_**. Subject to the
operation of Section 6.4 of these Bylaws, each Non-Officer Employee may, in
the discretion of the Board of Directors, be indemnified by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended, against any or all Expenses and Liabilities that are incurred by
such Non-Officer Employee or on such Non-Officer Employees behalf in
connection with any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding, or any claim,
issue or matter therein, which such Non-Officer Employee is, or is threatened
to be made, a party to or participant in by reason of such Non-Officer
Employees Corporate Status, if such Non-Officer Employee acted in good faith
and in a manner such Non-Officer Employee reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or the Predecessor, a
applicable, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The rights of
indemnification provided by this Section 6.3 shall exist as to a Non-Officer
Employee after he or she has ceased to be a Non-Officer Employee and shall
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, personal representatives, executors
and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may
indemnify any Non-Officer Employee seeking indemnification in connection with
a Proceeding initiated by such Non-Officer Employee only if such Proceeding
was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 6.4: _Determination_**. Unless ordered by a court, no
indemnification shall be provided pursuant to this Article VI to a Director,
to an Officer or to a Non-Officer Employee unless a determination shall have
been made that such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation or the Predecessor, as applicable, and, with respect to any
criminal Proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful. Such determination shall be made by (a) a majority vote
of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board of
Directors, (b) a committee comprised of Disinterested Directors, such
committee having been designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested
Directors (even though less than a quorum), (c) if there are no such
Disinterested Directors, or if a majority of Disinterested Directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 6.5: _Advancement of Expenses to Directors Prior to Final
Disposition_**.

 



 

(a) The Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any
Director in connection with any Proceeding in which such Director is involved
by reason of such Directors Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after
the receipt by the Corporation of a written statement from such Director
requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or
after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall
reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Director and shall be
preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of such Director to
repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Director is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance all Expenses
incurred by or on behalf of any Director seeking advancement of expenses
hereunder in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director only if
such Proceeding (including any parts of such Proceeding not initiated by such
Director) was (i) authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or
(ii) brought to enforce such Directors rights to indemnification or
advancement of Expenses under these Bylaws.

 



 

(b) If a claim for advancement of Expenses hereunder by a Director is not paid
in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Corporation of documentation of Expenses and the required undertaking, such
Director may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and if successful in whole or in part,
such Director shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting
such claim. The failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors
or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to make
a determination concerning the permissibility of such advancement of Expenses
under this Article VI shall not be a defense to an action brought by a
Director for recovery of the unpaid amount of an advancement claim and shall
not create a presumption that such advancement is not permissible. The burden
of proving that a Director is not entitled to an advancement of expenses shall
be on the Corporation.

 



 

(c) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Director
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 6.6: _Advancement of Expenses to Officers and Non-Officer
Employees Prior to Final Disposition._**.

 



 

(a) The Corporation may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, advance
any or all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any Officer or any Non-Officer
Employee in connection with any

 



      
 

 



 

Proceeding in which such person is involved by reason of his or her Corporate
Status as an Officer or Non-Officer Employee upon the receipt by the
Corporation of a statement or statements from such Officer or Non-Officer
Employee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior
to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements
shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Officer or Non-Officer
Employee and shall be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on
behalf of such person to repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Officer or Non-Officer Employee is not entitled to be
indemnified against such Expenses.

 



 

(b) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Officer
or Non-Officer Employee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 6.7: _Contractual Nature of Rights_**.

 



 

The provisions of this Article VI shall be deemed to be a contract between the
Corporation and each Director and Officer entitled to the benefits hereof at
any time while this Article VI is in effect, in consideration of such persons
past or current and any future performance of services for the Corporation or
the Predecessor, as applicable. Neither amendment, repeal or modification of
any provision of this Article VI nor the adoption of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VI shall eliminate
or reduce any right conferred by this Article VI in respect of any act or
omission occurring, or any cause of action or claim that accrues or arises or
any state of facts existing, at the time of or before such amendment, repeal,
modification or adoption of an inconsistent provision (even in the case of a
proceeding based on such a state of facts that is commenced after such time),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement of Expenses granted herein
or arising out of any act or omission shall vest at the time of the act or
omission in question, regardless of when or if any proceeding with respect to
such act or omission is commenced. The rights to indemnification and to
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI
shall continue notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director or
officer of the Corporation or the Predecessor and shall inure to the benefit
of the estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributes of
such person.

 



 

(a) If a claim for indemnification hereunder by a Director or Officer is not
paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after receipt by the
Corporation of a written claim for indemnification, such Director or Officer
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, such
Director or Officer shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of
prosecuting such claim. The failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such
indemnification under this Article VI shall not be a defense to an action
brought by a director or Officer for recovery of the unpaid amount of an
indemnification claim and shall not create a presumption that such
indemnification is not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director or
Officer is not entitled to indemnification shall be on the Corporation.

 



 

(b) In any suit brought by a director or Officer to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder, it shall be a defense that such Director or Officer
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 6.8: _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_**. The rights to indemnification
and to advancement of Expenses set forth in this Article VI shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any Director, Officer,

 



      
 

 



 

or Non-Officer Employee may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.

 



 

 **Section 6.9: _Insurance_**. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee
against any liability of any character asserted against or incurred by the
Corporation or any such Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee, or arising
out of any such persons Corporate Status, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the
DGCL or the provisions of this Article VI.

 



 

 **Section 6.10: _Other Indemnification_**. The Corporations obligation, if
any, to indemnify or provide advancement of Expenses to any person under this
Article VI as a result of such person serving, at the request of the
Corporation or the Predecessor, as a director, partner, trustee, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such
person may collect as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
enterprise (the " ** _Primary Indemnitor_** "). Any indemnification or
advancement of Expenses under this Article VI owed by the Corporation as a
result of a person serving, at the request of the Corporation or the
Predecessor, as a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise shall only be in excess of, and shall be secondary to, the
indemnification or advancement of Expenses available from the applicable
Primary Indemnitor(s) and any applicable insurance policies.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

NOTICES

 



 

 **Section 7.1: _Notice_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in these Bylaws (including,
without limitation, Section 7.1(b) below) or required by law, all notices
required to be given pursuant to these Bylaws shall be in writing and may in
every instance be effectively given by hand delivery (including use of a
delivery service), by depositing such notice in the mail, postage prepaid, or
by sending such notice by prepaid telegram, telex, overnight express courier,
mailgram or facsimile. Any such notice shall be addressed to the person to
whom notice is to be given at such persons address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation. The notice shall be deemed given (i) in the case
of hand delivery, when received by the person to whom notice is to be given or
by any person accepting such notice on behalf of such person, (ii) in the case
of delivery by mail, upon deposit in the mail, (iii) in the case of delivery
by overnight express courier, when dispatched, and (iv) in the case of
delivery via telegram, telex, mailgram, or facsimile, when dispatched.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the
Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation,
or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any
such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the
Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the Corporation
is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given
by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability
becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or
to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice;
provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a
revocation

 



      
 

 



 

shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to
this Section 7.1(b) shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other
form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.

 



 

(c) An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given in
writing or by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

 



 

 **Section 7.2: _Waiver of Notice_**. Whenever notice is required to be given
under any provision of these Bylaws, a written waiver of notice, signed by the
person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic transmission by such
person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in any waiver of notice.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

INTERESTED DIRECTORS

 



 

 **Section 8.1: _Interested Directors; Quorum_**. No contract or transaction
between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or
other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable
solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present
at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee
thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his,
her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (i) the material facts as
to his, her or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes
the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than
a quorum; (ii) the material facts as to his, her or their relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the
contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee
thereof, or the stockholders. Interested directors may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or
of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

conflict between the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation shall govern.

held to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with the provisions
of the Certificate of Incorporation, then such provision shall nonetheless be
enforced to the maximum extent possible consistent with such holding and the
remaining provisions of these Bylaws (including without limitation, all
portions of any section of these Bylaws containing any such provision held to
