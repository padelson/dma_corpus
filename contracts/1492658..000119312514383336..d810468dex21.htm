(iv) the parties shall take all actions that Ranger determines are necessary
or desirable to effectuate the provisions of this  _Section 2.08(b)_,
including obtaining board or committee consents or adopting or assuming a
Ranger Equity Plan by Trooper. Trooper shall provide Ranger, and Ranger shall
provide Trooper, with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment
upon, all resolutions, option agreements and other written actions as may be
required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.08(b)_.

 

(c) No fractional Trooper Shares shall be issued in connection with the
Merger, no dividends or distributions of Trooper shall relate to
such fractional share interests, no certificates for any such fractional
shares shall be issued, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a Trooper Shareholder. Any
Ranger Shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a
Trooper Share pursuant to the Merger (after taking into account all Ranger
Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by such holder) shall, in
lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such Ranger Share
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, be paid in cash the dollar amount determined
in accordance with _Section 2.10(e)_. The parties acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Trooper Shares was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Trooper
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Trooper Shares.

(d) All calculations performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall
be calculated to four decimal places (0.0001).

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Trooper, Holdco, Merger Sub, Ranger or any holder of shares
thereof, all shares of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which share
shall be held by Holdco.

 

(f) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to Ranger Shareholders in connection with the Merger.

2.09 _Closing of Ranger Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time (i) (A) each
certificate formerly representing any Ranger Share (other than an Excluded
Share) (" _Ranger Share Certificate_ ") and (B) each uncertificated Ranger
Share (" _Book-Entry Share_ ") formerly

 



17  representing any Ranger Share (other than an Excluded Share) shall cease to
be outstanding and (other than any Excluded Shares) shall represent only the
right to receive Trooper Shares (and cash in lieu of any fractional Trooper
Shares) as contemplated by _Section 2.08_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
2.13_ and all holders of Ranger Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as shareholders of Ranger; and (ii) the stock
transfer books of Ranger shall be closed with respect to all Ranger Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such Ranger Shares shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any Ranger Shares is presented to the Escrow and Exchange
Agent, to the Surviving Corporation or to Trooper, such Ranger Share
Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in this
_ARTICLE 2_.

 

2.10 _Exchange Fund; Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Trooper and Ranger shall mutually select a bank
or trust company, which may be the transfer agent for the Trooper Shares, to
act as escrow and exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Escrow and Exchange
Agent_ "), and, not later than the Effective Time, Trooper shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company, which agreement shall be
reasonably acceptable to Ranger (the " _Escrow Agency Agreement_ ").

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agency Agreement, as soon as possible on the Closing Date after the
Effective Time:

 

(i) In order to facilitate the payment of the Merger Consideration to the
former Ranger Shareholders, Holdco shall issue to the Escrow and Exchange
Agent (1) a promissory note receivable on Holdco (the terms and conditions,
including principal amount, for which to be mutually agreed upon by the
parties prior to the Closing Date) (the " _Holdco Note_ ") and (2) all of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Holdco (the " _Holdco Shares_ "), which Holdco Note and Holdco Shares shall
have an aggregate value equal to the aggregate value of the Ranger Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including shares
outstanding pursuant to _Section 2.08(b)(i)_ (other than Excluded Shares).
The Escrow and Exchange Agent shall receive the Holdco Note and the
Holdco Shares to facilitate the payment of the Merger Consideration. The
holding of the Holdco Note and Holdco Shares by the Escrow and Exchange Agent
is for the indirect benefit of the former Ranger Shareholders in that the
holding of the Holdco Note and Holdco Shares will be for the purposes of
paying up the Trooper Shares to be issued as Merger Consideration to the
former Ranger Shareholders.

 

(ii) In accordance with provisions of Section 2:94b of the Dutch Civil Code,
the Escrow and Exchange Agent shall contribute the Holdco Note and Holdco
Shares that were issued to the Escrow and Exchange Agent to Trooper as a
contribution in kind ( _inbreng op aandelen anders dan in geld_ ) to pay up
the Trooper Shares to be issued as Merger Consideration. 

(iii) In accordance with provisions of Section 2:94b of the Dutch Civil Code
and in consideration of the contribution pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_,
Trooper shall issue and deliver, at the Effective Time to the Escrow and
Exchange Agent solely for the account and benefit of the former Ranger
Shareholders, the maximum number of Trooper Shares that have become issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.08(a)(ii)_ for delivery to the Merger Consideration
recipients entitled thereto (such Trooper Shares being the " _Exchange Fund_
").

 



18 At the Effective Time, the obligations of Trooper, Holdco and the Escrow and
Exchange Agent under this _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be unconditional.

(c) At the Effective Time and without any action on the part of any holder,
all Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed surrendered to the Escrow and Exchange
Agent and Trooper shall cause the Escrow and Exchange Agent to (i) deliver to
each holder of Book-Entry Shares that number of uncertificated whole Trooper
Shares that the holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_
and cancel such Book-Entry Shares and (ii) mail to each holder of Book-Entry
Shares a check in the amount of any cash payable in respect of such holder
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.10(e)_.

(d) Trooper shall cause the Escrow and Exchange Agent to mail to the record
holders of Ranger Share Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form and containing such provisions as Trooper and Ranger may reasonably
specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Ranger Share
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Ranger
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such Ranger Share Certificates to the
Escrow and Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Ranger Share Certificates in exchange for the Trooper
Shares, as provided in _Section 2.08(a)_. Upon surrender of a Ranger Share
Certificate to the Escrow and Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Escrow and Exchange Agent or Trooper, (A) the
holder of such Ranger Share Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange a certificate or evidence of shares in book entry form representing
the number of whole Trooper Shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.08(a)_ (and cash in lieu of any
fractional Trooper Shares pursuant to _Section 2.10(e)_) and (B) the Ranger
Share Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.10(d)_, each Ranger Share
Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive Trooper Shares (and cash in lieu of any fractional
Trooper Shares pursuant to _Section 2.10(e)_) as contemplated by this
_ARTICLE 2_ and any distribution or dividend with respect to Trooper Shares,
the record date for which is after the Effective Time. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Ranger Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of Ranger, a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form
representing the proper number of Trooper Shares may be issued to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Ranger Share Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Ranger Share Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person
requesting such issuances shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of the Trooper Shares to a person other than the
registered holder of such Ranger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of
Trooper that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. If any Ranger
Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Trooper may, in
its discretion and as a

 



19  condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate or evidence of shares
in book-entry form representing Trooper Shares, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Ranger Share Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Trooper may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Escrow and
Exchange Agent, Trooper, Holdco, or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Ranger Share Certificate.

(e) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Escrow and
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of whole Trooper
Shares issued and delivered to the Escrow and Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.10(b)_ representing the Merger Consideration over (B) the
aggregate number of whole Trooper Shares to be distributed to former holders
of Ranger Shares pursuant to _Section 2.08(a)_ and _Section 2.08(b)(ii)_
(determined before taking into account any Trooper Shares withheld under
_Section 2.11_) (such excess, the " _Trooper Excess Shares_ "). Following
the Effective Time, the Escrow and Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of former
shareholders of Ranger, sell the Trooper Excess Shares at then prevailing
prices on the NASDAQ, all in the manner provided in _Section 2.10(e)(i)_.

(i) The sale of the Trooper Excess Shares by the Escrow and Exchange Agent
shall be executed on the NASDAQ through one or more member firms of the NASDAQ
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Escrow and
Exchange Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the sale
of the Trooper Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as is
practicable, consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in
light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of Ranger Share Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Ranger Shares, the Escrow and Exchange
Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for holders of Ranger Shares (the "
_Ranger Shares Trust_ "). Trooper shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation of the Escrow and Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such
sale of Trooper Excess Shares. The Escrow and Exchange Agent shall determine
the portion of the Ranger Shares Trust to which each former Ranger Shareholder
is entitled, if any, by multiplying that amount of the aggregate net proceeds
composing the Ranger Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the amount of the fractional share interest to which such former Ranger
Shareholder is entitled (after taking into account all Ranger Shares held as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time by such holder) and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all
former holders of Ranger Shares are entitled.

(ii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Ranger Share Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing Ranger Shares with respect to any fractional share
interest, the Escrow and Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of Ranger Share Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, subject to
and in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.10_.

 

(f) All Trooper Shares to be issued and delivered to the Escrow and Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ shall be deemed issued and outstanding
as of the Effective

 



20  Time, and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Trooper
in respect of Trooper Shares, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all Trooper Shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to the Trooper Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of an unsurrendered Ranger Share Certificate with respect
to the Trooper Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the Merger until such holder surrenders such Ranger Share Certificate in
accordance with this  _Section 2.10_. All such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Trooper to the Escrow and Exchange Agent after
deduction of any applicable Taxes and shall be included in the Exchange Fund,
in each case until the surrender of such Ranger Share Certificate in
accordance with this _Section 2.10_. Subject to the effect of applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Ranger Share Certificate there shall be
paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (A) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such Trooper Shares and not
paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such Trooper Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Ranger Share Certificates as of the date one (1) year after the Closing Date
shall be delivered to Trooper upon demand, and any holders of Ranger Share
Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Ranger Share
Certificates to the Escrow and Exchange Agent in accordance with this 
_Section 2.10(g)_, as well as any holders of Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore cashed any check payable to them in accordance with _Section
2.10(e)_, shall thereafter look only to Trooper for satisfaction of their
claims for Trooper Shares, cash in lieu of fractional Trooper Shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Trooper Shares, subject to
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.

 

(h) Neither Trooper, Holdco, nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any current or former Ranger Shareholder or to any other Person with respect
to any Trooper Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or
for any cash amounts, properly delivered to any public official in compliance
with any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law. If
any Ranger Share Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five
(5) years after the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Trooper Shares or any dividends or other distributions payable to
the holder of such Ranger Share Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Body), any Trooper Shares issuable
upon the surrender of, or any dividends or other distributions in respect of,
such Ranger Share Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Trooper, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

2.11 _Withholding_. Each of Ranger, Trooper, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation (as applicable) shall be entitled to deduct or withhold such
amounts as it determines, in its sole discretion, are necessary to cover all
required withholdings from the amounts payable (including Trooper Shares
deliverable) under this Agreement in accordance with the Code and any
other applicable Law, and the Escrow and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
so deduct or withhold to the extent it is entitled as set forth in the general
instructions in the letter of

 



21  transmittal. Any such withheld or deducted amount shall be timely paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Body and treated as though such amount had
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was required.

2.12 _Interest; No Liability_. All payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_
shall be without interest. Neither Trooper, Holdco, Merger Sub nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash or
securities delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property law, escheat law or similar Law.

2.13 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, in the event that Ranger changes the number of Ranger
Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time or Trooper changes
the number of Trooper Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time, in either case, as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the consideration paid in accordance with this
Agreement, including the Exchange Ratio, shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change.

2.14 _Alternative Structures_. In the event of a change in Tax Law,
the parties agree to reasonably cooperate in the consideration and
implementation of alternative structures to effect the business combination
contemplated by this Agreement, as long as any such alternative structure does
not cause any condition set forth in _ARTICLE 6_ to not be capable of being,
or not reasonably likely to be, satisfied on or before the Termination Date.

2.15  _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Trooper or Ranger to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to rights and property of Merger
Sub and Ranger, the officers and directors of Trooper shall be further
authorized to take such action. Trooper and the Surviving Corporation also
shall take such further actions as may be necessary or desirable to ensure
that the Escrow and Exchange Agent sends out the letters of transmittal to
Ranger Shareholders and issues certificates or evidence of shares in book-
entry form representing Trooper Shares to such shareholders in accordance
with _Section 2.10_.

2.16 _Post-Merger Operations_. The Trooper Board shall take all necessary
corporate action, to the extent within its power and authority, to cause the
following to occur as of the Effective Time: (i) the directors constituting
the Trooper Board shall be as set forth in _Schedule 2.16_ and duly nominated
by the Trooper Board prior to the Effective Time, subject to such
individuals ability and willingness to serve, and (ii) the non-executive
chairman of the Trooper Board shall be designated in accordance with the
provisions of _Schedule 2.16_  hereto, subject to such individuals ability
and willingness to serve. In the event any designee identified on _Schedule
2.16_ becomes unable or unwilling to serve as of the Effective Time as a
director on the Trooper Board or as chairman thereof, a replacement for such
designee shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of _Schedule
2.16_ hereto.

 



22 ARTICLE 3

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF RANGER_

 

Except as disclosed in (a) the Ranger SEC Documents furnished or filed prior
to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures relating to forward-looking
statements to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature) or (b) the confidential disclosure letter delivered by
Ranger to Trooper prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(the " _Ranger Disclosure Letter_ "), Ranger represents and warrants to
Trooper as follows:

3.01 _Organization and Corporate Power_. Ranger is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder. Each of the Subsidiaries of
Ranger is a corporation or other entity duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each
of Ranger and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and
authority and all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to hold such authorizations,
licenses and permits would not have a Ranger Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Ranger and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or authorized to do business and
is in good standing in every jurisdiction (to the extent such concept exists
in such jurisdiction) in which its ownership of property or the conduct of
business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where the failure to
be so qualified, authorized or in good standing would not have a Ranger
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of Ranger, as in effect as of the date hereof,
have been heretofore made available to Trooper.

3.02  _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and each other agreement, document,
instrument or certificate contemplated hereby by Ranger and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Ranger, and, subject
to obtaining the Ranger Shareholder Approval, no other proceedings on Rangers
part are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement. Assuming that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
of Trooper, Holdco and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Ranger, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization or moratorium Laws, other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the
availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies.

3.03 _Capital Stock_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Ranger consists of 100,000,000 Ranger
Shares and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of

complete list as of the Measurement Date of the outstanding Ranger Shares,
Ranger Options, Ranger Restricted Shares, Ranger RSUs, Ranger ESPP Purchase
Rights (assuming that all participants in Ranger ESPP as of the date hereof

date under Ranger ESPP) and Convertible Notes, including, with respect to each
Ranger Option, Ranger RSU award and Ranger ESPP Purchase Right, the number of
Ranger Shares issuable thereunder or with respect thereto, the holder thereof
and the exercise price (if any), and Ranger has granted no other such awards
since the Measurement Date and prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) All of the outstanding Ranger Shares have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive or similar
rights. All of the issued and outstanding Ranger Shares were issued in
compliance with all applicable Laws concerning the issuance of securities.
Ranger does not have any other equity securities or securities containing
any equity features authorized, issued or outstanding, and there are no
agreements, options, warrants or other rights or arrangements existing or
outstanding which provide for the sale or issuance of any of the foregoing by
Ranger. There are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other equity
interests or voting securities of Ranger, (ii) securities convertible or
exchangeable, directly or indirectly, into capital stock of Ranger, (iii)
options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights, preemptive rights,

other contracts that require Ranger to issue, sell or otherwise cause to
become outstanding or to acquire, repurchase or redeem capital stock of
Ranger, (iv) stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or
similar rights with respect to Ranger or (v) bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of Ranger having the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of Ranger may vote.

(d) All of the Ranger Shares issuable upon exercise of underlying warrants
executed in connection with the issuance of Convertible Notes have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and were issued in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Plans, indenture, and applicable Laws.

3.04 _Subsidiaries_. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
equivalent equity interests of each of Rangers Subsidiaries are owned of
record and beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Ranger free and clear of
all material Liens, pledges, security interests or other encumbrances (other
than Permitted Liens).

 

3.05 _No Breach_. Except with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would
not constitute a Ranger Material

 



24  Adverse Effect, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Ranger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not (i)
conflict with or violate Rangers Organizational Documents, (ii) assuming all
consents, approvals authorizations and other actions described in _Section
3.06_ have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in _Section
3.06_ have been made, conflict with or violate any Law, statute, rule or

filing with any Governmental Body in connection with the execution, delivery
or performance by it of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Other than as stated above, no consent,
approval or authorization of any Governmental Body or any other party or
Person is required to be obtained by Ranger in connection with its
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except for those consents, approvals and
authorizations the failure of which to obtain would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Ranger Material Adverse
Effect.

3.07 _SEC Reports; Disclosure Controls and Procedures_.

 

(a) Ranger has filed or furnished all reports and other documents with the SEC
required to be filed or furnished by Ranger since December 31, 2012 (the "
_Ranger SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates (or, if
amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such amendment, supplement or superseding
filing): (i) each of the Ranger SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (as the case may be), and the requirements of SOX, each as in
effect on the date so filed or furnished, and (ii) none of the Ranger SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

the Ranger SEC Documents (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered (except as may be indicated in the

as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not have contained notes and were subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments); and (iii) fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Ranger and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of Ranger and its consolidated Subsidiaries for
the periods covered thereby.

(c) Ranger has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a15(f) and 15d15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting. Ranger (i) has designed and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a15(e) and
15d15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that all
information required to be disclosed by Ranger in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to Rangers management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of
this Agreement, to Rangers auditors and the audit committee of the Ranger
Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Rangers
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Rangers internal control over
financial reporting. Since December 31, 2012, any material change in internal
control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Ranger SEC
Document has been so disclosed.

Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Ranger, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Ranger or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise obtained knowledge of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and, (ii) to the knowledge of Ranger, no attorney
representing Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation,
by Ranger or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the board
of directors or any committee thereof or to any director or executive officer
of Ranger.

(e) Ranger is in material compliance with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

the date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or (c) as set forth in  _Section 3.08_ of the Ranger Disclosure

 



26  Letter, Ranger, together with its Subsidiaries, does not have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether known or unknown, absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due, in each
case required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against in the consolidated

valid and enforceable leases or other comparable contract rights, all of the
personal property and other tangible assets necessary for the conduct of the
business of Ranger and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently
conducted, in each case free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), except where the failure to do so would not constitute a Ranger
Material Adverse Effect. To Rangers knowledge, all such items of tangible
personal property are in operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and
tear excepted) and have been maintained in accordance with normal industry
practices.

 



28 (b) The owned and leased real property described in _Section 3.10(b)_ to the

the real property used, occupied or leased by Ranger or its Subsidiaries. The
Ranger Real Property leases are in full force and effect, and Ranger holds a
valid and existing leasehold interest in the Ranger Real Property under each
such applicable lease. Neither Ranger nor, to Rangers knowledge, any other
party to the applicable Ranger Real Property leases is in default in any
material respect under any of such leases. No event has occurred which, if
not remedied, would result in a default by Ranger in any material respect
under the Ranger Real Property leases, and, to Rangers knowledge, no event
has occurred which, if not remedied, would result in a default by any party
other than Ranger in any material respect under the Ranger Real Property
leases.

procedures. Since the date of the Ranger Balance Sheet, neither Ranger nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary
course of business.

(b) No claim has been made in writing by any Governmental Body in a
jurisdiction where Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns
that such Person is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There
are no material liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable)
upon any of the assets of Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries. Ranger and its
Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party.

(c) No material non-U.S., federal, state or local Tax audits or administrative
or judicial Tax proceedings are pending or being conducted with respect to
Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries.

or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any material Tax or file any material Tax
Return, other than any such request made in the ordinary course of business,

limitations for the assessment or collection of any material Tax of Ranger or
any of its Subsidiaries that is currently in force.

(e) Neither Ranger nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
Tax allocation, sharing or similar agreement (other than any commercial
agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business that does not relate
primarily to Taxes). Neither Ranger nor 

 



29  any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing
a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which was Ranger) or (B) has liability for the Taxes of any Person
(other than Ranger or its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise (other than any commercial
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that do not relate
primarily to Taxes).

 

(f) Ranger and its Subsidiaries have established procedures and have been in
compliance with the medical device excise tax provisions imposed by Section
4191 of the Code since the effective date of such provisions and to the extent
it is applicable to their operations.

(g) Neither Ranger nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning of Code section

(h) Neither Ranger nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any (A) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date or (B) election under Section
108(i) of the Code.

(i) Neither Ranger nor any of its Subsidiaries have taken and agree not to

within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

(a) All of the patents, domain names, registered and material unregistered
trademarks and service marks, registered and material unregistered copyrights
and applications for any of the foregoing, that are currently owned by Ranger
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Ranger Intellectual Property_ ")
are set forth in _Section 3.13_ of the Ranger Disclosure Letter. (i) One or
more of Ranger and its Subsidiaries owns and possesses all right, title and

Property, and no item of Ranger Intellectual Property is the subject of any

promulgated or applied by a Governmental Body or arbitrator of which Ranger
has received written notice.

 

(b) To Rangers knowledge, Ranger and its Subsidiaries, their Products and the
business of Ranger and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, does not
infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property owned by another Person and has not infringed, misappropriated,
diluted or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property owned by another
Person within the past four (4) years. Ranger and its Subsidiaries have not,
within the past four (4) years, received any charge, complaint, claim, demand,
notice or other communication alleging any infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or other violation (including any claim that Ranger or a Subsidiary
must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property of another Person
in order to avoid infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation)
of the Intellectual Property of another Person, and there is no pending
action, claim, or suit alleging any such infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or violation.

 



32 (c) Ranger and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all Technology
necessary for the manufacture, use and sale of Products, as currently
marketed for sale, and for the conduct of the business of Ranger and such
Subsidiary, respectively, as currently conducted; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing will not be interpreted as a representation regarding the
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of Intellectual
Property owned by another Person, which topic is dealt with exclusively in
_Section 3.13(b)_ above.

 

(d) Ranger and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable efforts to
protect and preserve their rights in all Ranger Intellectual Property. To the
knowledge of Ranger, all employees, contractors and consultants who have
created Intellectual Property used in the conduct of the business of Ranger or
a Subsidiary as currently conducted have assigned to one or more of Ranger

by Law and to the extent such rights would not automatically vest with Ranger
or one of its Subsidiaries by operation of Law.

 

3.14 _Litigation_. There are (a) no Actions pending or, (b) to Rangers

agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, and Ranger and
its Subsidiaries are not subject to or in violation of any outstanding
judgment, order or decree of any court or Governmental Body in each case that
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Ranger Material Adverse
Effect. This  _Section 3.14_ shall not apply to Taxes, with respect to which
exclusively the representations and warranties in _Section 3.11_ shall apply.

 

3.15 _Insurance_. _Section 3.15_ of the Ranger Disclosure Letter lists each
material insurance policy maintained by Ranger or, to Rangers knowledge,
under which Ranger is a named insured or otherwise the principal beneficiary
of coverage, including the policy number and the period, type and amount of
coverage. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect and shall
continue in effect until the Closing Date. Such insurance policies are
sufficient, in all material respects in the aggregate, with the operation of
Rangers business for the industry in which it operates. Ranger is not in
default with respect to its obligations under any such insurance policies
and, to Rangers knowledge, there is no threatened termination of, or
threatened premium increase with respect to, any of such policies, other than
in connection with Rangers annual renewal process.

3.16 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Section 3.16_ of the Ranger Disclosure Letter lists all current Ranger
Plans (other than immaterial Non-U.S. Plans that are otherwise Ranger Plans).
Each Ranger Plan that is intended to meet the requirements to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
or is covered by a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
that remains current to the effect that the form of such Ranger Plan is so
qualified, and Ranger is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of such Ranger Plan.
The Ranger Plans comply in form

 



33  and in operation in all material respects with the requirements of the Code,
ERISA and other applicable Law; and Ranger has not become subject to any
material liability by reason of (i) a failure to provide any notice, (ii) a
failure to make any contribution to a Ranger Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code within the time prescribed for the
contribution under ERISA, or (iii) a breach of fiduciary duty or prohibited
transaction under ERISA or any other applicable Law, in each case with respect
to a Ranger Plan.

(b) With respect to each current material Ranger Plan, Ranger has made
available true and complete copies of the following (as applicable) prior to
the date hereof: (i) the plan document, including all amendments thereto or,
with respect to any unwritten plan, a summary of all material terms thereof;
(ii) the summary plan description along with all summaries of material
modifications thereto; (iii) all related trust instruments or other funding-
related documents; (iv) a copy of the most recent financial statements for
the plan; (v) a copy of all material correspondence with any Governmental Body
relating to a Ranger Plan received or sent within the last two years and (vi)
the most recent determination or opinion letter.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Ranger Material Adverse Effect, with respect to the Ranger
Plans, (i) all required contributions to, and premiums payable in respect of,
such Ranger Plan have been made or, to the extent not required to be made on
or before the date hereof, have been properly accrued on Rangers financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) there are no actions, audits,
suits or claims pending or, to Rangers knowledge, threatened, other than
routine claims for benefits.

 

(d) Neither Ranger nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has at any time in the past
six years sponsored or contributed to, or has or has had any liability or
obligation in respect of any Ranger Plan (including any "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)) that is or was
at any relevant time subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.
None of the Ranger Plans obligates Ranger or its Subsidiaries to provide a
current or former employee or other service provider (or any spouse or
dependent thereof) any life insurance or medical or health benefits after his
or her termination of employment with Ranger or any of its Subsidiaries, other
than as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B
of the Code or any other Law and coverage through the end of the month
of termination of employment.

(e) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution
or delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will, either individually or together with the occurrence
of some other event (including a termination of employment or service), (i)
result in any payment (including severance, bonus or other similar payment)
becoming due to any Person, (ii) increase or otherwise enhance any benefits or
compensation otherwise payable under any Ranger Plan, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any
Ranger Plan, (iv) require Ranger or its Subsidiaries to set aside any assets
to fund any benefits under a Ranger Plan or result in the forgiveness in whole
or in part of any outstanding loans made by Ranger to any Person, (v) limit
the ability to amend or terminate any Ranger Plan or related trust or (vi)
result in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Code Section 280G or in the imposition of an excise Tax under Code Section
4999 or Section 409A (or, in either case, any corresponding

 



34  provision of state, local or foreign Tax law). Ranger has no obligation to
pay any gross-up in respect of any Tax under Code Section 4999 or Section 409A
(or, in either case, any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law).

(f) With respect to each Ranger Plan, and except as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, that is a Non-U.S. Plan, the fair market value of the assets of each
funded Non-U.S. Plan, the liability of each insurer for any non-U.S. Plan
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S.
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the benefits determined on an ongoing basis (actual or contingent)
with respect to all current or former participants under such Non-U.S. Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuation most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Plan, and none of the
contemplated transactions will cause such assets, insurance obligations or
book reserves to be less than such benefit obligations. Each such Non-U.S.
Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in
all material respects in good standing with each applicable Governmental Body.
No Ranger Plan that is a Non-U.S. Plan is a defined benefit pension plan.

3.17 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Ranger and each of its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
exemptions, consents, certificates, authorizations, registrations and other
approvals from Governmental Bodies required to operate their respective
businesses as they are being conducted as of the date hereof (collectively,
the " _Permits_ "), and all of such Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to obtain or have any such Permit would,
individually or in the aggregate, not reasonably be expected to have a Ranger
Material Adverse Effect, and no proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
Ranger, threatened to revoke, suspend, cancel, terminate or adversely modify
any such Permit. Neither Ranger nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material
violation of, or in default under, any Law, in each case applicable to Ranger
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and properties.

commission, rebate, promotional allowance or gift of funds or property or any
other economic benefit to or from any employee, official or agent of any

was illegal under any Law (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

or permitted the release of any Hazardous Substance at any real property,
including the Ranger Real Property, so as to give rise to Liability for
investigation costs, cleanup costs, response costs, corrective action
costs, personal injury, property damage, natural resources damages or
attorney fees under CERCLA or any other Environmental Laws; and

(e) to Rangers knowledge, there are no and have never been any Hazardous
Substances present on, at, in or under any real property currently or formerly

to employees of Ranger, and Ranger has not been subject to an application by a
labor union, works council or other employee representative body to be
declared a common or related employer under labor relations legislation.

manufacture, testing, sale, marketing and distribution of Products by or on
behalf of Ranger is being, and has been since December 31, 2011, conducted in
material compliance with all applicable Healthcare Laws, including, without
limitation, requirements relating to clinical and non-clinical research,
product approval or clearance, premarketing notification, labeling,
advertising and promotion, record-keeping, adverse event reporting, reporting
of corrections and removals, and current good manufacturing practices for
medical device products. Ranger and, to Rangers knowledge, any contract
manufacturers assisting in the manufacture of the Products or Product
components are, and, since December 31, 2011, have been, in compliance with
FDAs device registration and listing requirements to the extent required by
applicable Healthcare Laws insofar as they pertain to the manufacture of
Products or Product components for Ranger, except as has not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Ranger
Material Adverse Effect. Ranger has not received written notification of any
pending or threatened claim, suit, proceeding, hearing, enforcement, audit,
investigation, arbitration or other action from any Governmental Body,
including, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector
General, or any comparable state or federal Governmental Body alleging
potential or actual non-compliance by, or Liability of, Ranger under any
Healthcare Law.

 

(b) Ranger holds such Permits of Governmental Bodies required for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted, including, without limitation, those
Permits necessary to permit the design, development, pre-clinical and clinical
testing, manufacture, labeling, sale, shipment, distribution and promotion of
its Products in jurisdictions where it currently conducts such
activities with respect to each Product (collectively, the " _Ranger_

 



37   __ _Licenses_ "), except to the extent where the failure to hold such
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Ranger Material Adverse Effect. Ranger has fulfilled and performed all
of its obligations with respect to each Ranger License and is in material
compliance with all terms and conditions of each Ranger License, and, to
Rangers knowledge, no event has occurred which allows, or after notice or
lapse of time would allow, revocation, suspension or termination thereof or
would result in any other impairment of the rights of the holder of any Ranger
License, except to the extent where the failure to be in material compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Ranger Material Adverse Effect. Ranger has not received any written
information or notification from the FDA or any other Governmental Body with
jurisdiction over the testing, marketing, sale, use, handling and control,
safety, efficacy, reliability, distribution or manufacturing of medical
devices which would reasonably be expected to lead to the denial of any
application for marketing approval or clearance currently pending before the
FDA or any other Governmental Body.

(c) All material filings, reports, documents, claims, submissions and notices
required to be filed, maintained or furnished to the FDA, state or other
Governmental Bodies have been so filed, maintained or furnished and were
complete and correct in all material respects on the date filed (or
were corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing), including adverse
event reports, medical device reports and reports of corrections and removals
with regard to the Products. All applications, notifications, submissions,
information, claims, reports, filings and other data and conclusions derived
therefrom utilized as the basis for, or submitted in connection with, any and
all requests for a Ranger License from the FDA or other Governmental Body
relating to Ranger or its businesses or the Products, when submitted to the
FDA or any other Governmental Body, whether oral, written or electronically
delivered, were true, accurate and complete in all material respects as of the
date of submission. Any necessary or required updates, changes, corrections
or modifications to such applications, notifications, submissions,
information, claims, reports, filings and other data have been submitted to
the FDA or other Governmental Body and as so updated, changed, corrected or
modified remain true, accurate and complete in all material respects and do
not materially misstate any of the statements or information included therein
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

 

(d) Ranger has not received any written notice or other communication from the
FDA or any other Governmental Body contesting the pre-market clearance or
approval of, the uses of or the labeling and promotion of any of the Products.
No manufacturing site which assists in the manufacture of the Products or
Product components (whether Ranger-owned or operated or that of a
contract manufacturer for any Products or Product components) has been
subject to a Governmental Body (including the FDA) shutdown or import or
export detention, refusal or prohibition. Neither Ranger nor, to Rangers
knowledge, any manufacturing site which assists in the manufacture of any
material Products or material Product components (whether Ranger-owned or
operated or that of a contract manufacturer for the Products or Product
components) has received, since December 31, 2011, any FDA Form 483 or other
Governmental Body notice of inspectional observations or adverse findings,
"warning letters," "untitled letters" or similar correspondence or notice from
the FDA or other Governmental Body alleging or asserting noncompliance with
any applicable Healthcare Laws or Ranger Licenses or alleging a lack of safety
or effectiveness from the FDA or any other Governmental Body, and, to Rangers
knowledge, there is no such action or proceeding pending or threatened.

 



38 (e) The FDA has not mandated that Ranger recall any of its Products. There are
no recalls of any of Rangers Products contemplated by Ranger or pending.
Since December 31, 2011, there have been no recalls (either voluntary or
involuntary), field notifications, field corrections, market withdrawals or
replacements, warnings, "dear doctor" letters, investigator notices, safety
alerts or other notices of action relating to an alleged lack of safety,
efficacy or regulatory compliance of any Product or Product component, or
seizures ordered or adverse regulatory actions taken (or, to Rangers
knowledge, threatened) by the FDA or any Governmental Body with respect to any
of the Products or Product components or any facilities where Products or
Product components are developed, designed, tested, manufactured, assembled,
processed, packaged or stored.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(f)_ of the Ranger Disclosure Letter,
there are no clinical trials that are being conducted as of the date hereof
by or on behalf of, or sponsored by, Ranger.

(g) Ranger is not the subject of any pending or, to the knowledge of Ranger,
threatened investigation regarding Ranger or the Products by the FDA pursuant
to the FDA Fraud Policy. Neither Ranger nor, to the knowledge of Ranger, any
officer, employee, agent or distributor of Ranger has made an untrue
statement of material fact to the FDA or any other Governmental Body, failed
to disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any other
Governmental Body or committed an act, made a statement or failed to make a
statement that, at the time such disclosure was made, would reasonably be
expected to provide a basis for the FDA or any other Governmental Body to
invoke the FDA Fraud Policy or any similar policy. Neither Ranger nor, to the
knowledge of Ranger, any officer, employee, agent or distributor of Ranger
has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which such
Person could be excluded from participating in the federal health care
programs under Section 1128 of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended,
or any similar Law. No claims, actions, proceedings or investigation that
would reasonably be expected to result in a debarment or exclusion are pending
or, to the knowledge of Ranger, threatened, against Ranger or, to the
knowledge of Ranger, any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

3.21 _Brokerage_. There are no claims for, nor shall any Person be entitled
to, any brokerage commissions, finders fees or similar compensation in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based on any arrangement
or agreement made by or on behalf of Ranger. Ranger has been given access to
a true and correct copy of all Contracts entitling any person to any brokerage
commissions, finders fees or similar compensation in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based on any arrangement or agreement made
by or on behalf of Ranger, together with all amendments, waivers or other
changes thereto.

3.22 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or
on behalf of Ranger for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed
with the SEC and becomes effective under the Securities Act or (b) the Joint

Ranger Shareholders, or at the time of the Ranger Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue 

 



39  statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein, necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or necessary
in order to correct any statement of a material fact in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Ranger
Shareholders Meeting which has become false or misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ranger makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by or to
be supplied by Trooper that is included or incorporated by reference in the

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TROOPER, HOLDCO, AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in (a) the Trooper SEC Documents furnished or filed prior
to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures relating to forward-looking
statements to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature) or (b) the confidential disclosure letter delivered by
Trooper to Ranger prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(the " _Trooper Disclosure Letter_ "), Trooper, Holdco and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to Ranger as follows:

4.01  _Organization and Corporate Power_. Trooper is a Dutch public company
with limited liability duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of
the Netherlands, with full corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder. Each of the Subsidiaries of

under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each
of Trooper and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and
authority and all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to hold such authorizations, licenses and
permits would not have a Trooper Material Adverse Effect. Each of Trooper and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or authorized to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction (to the extent such concept exists in
such jurisdiction) in which its ownership of property or the conduct of
business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where the failure to
be so qualified, authorized or in good standing would not have a Trooper
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the articles of
association of Trooper, as in effect as of the date hereof, have been
heretofore made available to Ranger.

 

4.02 _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each other agreement, document, or
instrument or certificate contemplated hereby by Trooper, Holdco and Merger
Sub and, subject to obtaining the Trooper Shareholder Approval, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Trooper,
Holdco and Merger Sub, and, subject to obtaining the Trooper Shareholder
Approval, the resolution to issue new Trooper Shares to former Ranger
Shareholders and the implementation of the Articles of Association, no other
proceedings on Troopers, Holdcos or Merger Subs part are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement. Assuming
that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of Ranger, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Trooper, Holdco and
Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization or moratorium Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies.

 



41 4.03 _Capital Stock_.

Trooper; (iv) stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or
similar rights with respect to Trooper or (v) bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of Trooper having the right to vote on any matters on

conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would

Person is required to be obtained by Trooper in connection with its execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for those consents, approvals and

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Trooper Material Adverse
Effect.

jurisdiction where Trooper and any of its Subsidiaries do not file Tax
Returns that such Person is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. There are no material liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet
due and payable) upon any of the assets of Trooper or any of
its Subsidiaries. Trooper and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,

a member of an affiliated group filing a combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was

Contract_ " and, collectively, the " _Trooper Material Contracts_ "), and,
(ii) to Troopers knowledge, as of the date hereof, the other party to each of
the Trooper Material Contracts is not in default thereunder. Each Trooper

and enforceable against Trooper and, to Troopers knowledge, each other party

given any written notice, or to the knowledge of Trooper, any notice (whether
or not written) of termination or cancellation of any Trooper Material

hereby or otherwise).

4.13 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) All of the patents, domain names, registered and material unregistered
trademarks and service marks, registered and material unregistered copyrights
and applications for any of the foregoing, that are currently owned by Trooper
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Trooper Intellectual Property_ ")
are set forth in _Section 4.13_ of the Trooper Disclosure Letter. (i) One or
more of Trooper and its Subsidiaries owns and possesses all right, title and
interest in and to each item of the Trooper Intellectual Property free and
clear of all liens other than Permitted Liens; (ii) to the knowledge of

otherwise violating, or has previously within the past four (4) years
infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, any Trooper
Intellectual Property and (iii) no Person has provided written notice of a
claim or action or, to the knowledge of Trooper, threatened a claim or action,
challenging the ownership, validity or scope of any Trooper Intellectual
Property, and no item of Trooper Intellectual Property is the subject of any
outstanding order, injunction, judgment, decree or ruling enacted, adopted,
promulgated or applied by a Governmental Body or arbitrator of which Trooper
has received written notice.

 

(b) To Troopers knowledge, Trooper and its Subsidiaries, their Products and
the business of Trooper and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, does not
infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property owned by another Person and has not infringed, misappropriated,
diluted or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property owned by another
Person within the past four (4) years. Trooper and its Subsidiaries have not,
within the past four (4) years, received any charge, complaint, claim, demand,
notice or other communication alleging any infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or other violation (including any claim that Trooper or a Subsidiary
must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property of another Person
in order to avoid infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation)
of the Intellectual Property of another Person, and there is no pending
action, claim, suit alleging any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution
or violation.

 

(c) Trooper and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all Technology
necessary for the manufacture, use and sale of Products, as currently
marketed for sale and for

 



50  the conduct of the business of Trooper and such Subsidiary, respectively, as
currently conducted; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will not be
interpreted as a representation regarding the infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or other violation of Intellectual Property owned by another Person,
which topic is dealt with exclusively in _Section 4.13(b)_ above.

 

(d) Trooper and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable efforts to
protect and preserve their rights in all Trooper Intellectual Property. To
the knowledge of Trooper, all employees, contractors and consultants who have
created Intellectual Property used in the conduct of the business of Trooper
or a Subsidiary as currently conducted have assigned to one or more of Trooper
or its Subsidiaries all of their rights therein, to the full extent permitted
by Law and to the extent such rights would not automatically vest with Trooper
or one of its Subsidiaries by operation of Law.

 

4.14 _Litigation_. There are (a) no Actions pending or, (b) to Troopers
knowledge, no Actions threatened against Trooper or any of its Subsidiaries,
at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state, provincial, municipal
or other governmental or regulatory department, commission, board, bureau,
agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, and Trooper and
its Subsidiaries are not subject to or in violation of any outstanding
judgment, order or decree of any court or Governmental Body, in each case that
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Trooper Material Adverse
Effect. This  _Section 4.14_ shall not apply to Taxes, with respect to which
exclusively the representations and warranties in _Section 4.11_ shall apply.

 

4.15 _Insurance_. _Section 4.15_ of the Trooper Disclosure Letter lists each
material insurance policy maintained by Trooper or, to Troopers knowledge,
under which Trooper is a named insured or otherwise the principal beneficiary
of coverage, including the policy number and the period, type and amount of
coverage. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect and shall
continue in effect until the Closing Date. Such insurance policies are
sufficient, in all material respects in the aggregate, with the operation of
Troopers business for the industry in which it operates. Trooper is not
in default with respect to its obligations under any such insurance policies
and, to Troopers knowledge, there is no threatened termination of, or
threatened premium increase with respect to, any of such policies other than
in connection with Troopers annual renewal process.

4.16 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Section 4.16_ of the Trooper Disclosure Letter lists all current Trooper
Plans (other than immaterial Non-U.S. Plans that are otherwise Trooper
Plans). Each Trooper Plan that is intended to meet the requirements to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter or is covered by a favorable opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service that remains current to the effect that the form of
such Trooper Plan is so qualified, and Trooper is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the
qualification of such Trooper Plan. The Trooper Plans comply in form and in
operation in all material respects with the requirements of the Code, ERISA
and other applicable Law, and Trooper has not become subject to any material
liability by reason of (i) a failure to provide any notice, (ii) a failure to
make any contribution to a Trooper Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code within the time prescribed for the contribution under ERISA
or (iii) a breach of fiduciary duty or prohibited transaction under ERISA or
any other applicable Law, in each case with respect to a Trooper Plan.

 



51 (b) With respect to each current material Trooper Plan, Trooper has made
available true and complete copies of the following (as applicable) prior to
the date hereof: (i) the plan document, including all amendments thereto or,
with respect to any unwritten plan, a summary of all material terms thereof;
(ii) the summary plan description along with all summaries of material
modifications thereto; (iii) all related trust instruments or other funding-
related documents; (iv) a copy of the most recent financial statements for the
plan; (v) a copy of all material correspondence with any Governmental Body
relating to a Trooper Plan received or sent within the last two years and (vi)
the most recent determination or opinion letter.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Trooper Material Adverse Effect, with respect to the Trooper
Plans, (i) all required contributions to, and premiums payable in respect of,
such Trooper Plan have been made or, to the extent not required to be made on
or before the date hereof, have been properly accrued on Troopers financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) there are no actions, audits,
suits or claims pending or, to Troopers knowledge, threatened, other than
routine claims for benefits.

 

(d) Neither Trooper nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has at any time in the
past six years sponsored or contributed to, or has or has had any liability
or obligation in respect of any Trooper Plan (including any "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)) that is or
was at any relevant time subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. None of the Trooper Plans obligates Trooper or its Subsidiaries to
provide a current or former employee or other service provider (or any spouse
or dependent thereof) any life insurance or medical or health benefits after
his or her termination of employment with Trooper or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section
4980B of the Code or any other Law and coverage through the end of the month
of termination of employment.

(e) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution
or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will, either individually or together with the occurrence
of some other event (including a termination of employment or service), (i)
result in any payment (including severance, bonus or other similar payment)
becoming due to any Person, (ii) increase or otherwise enhance any benefits or
compensation otherwise payable under any Trooper Plan, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any
Trooper Plan, (iv) require Trooper or its Subsidiaries to set aside any assets
to fund any benefits under a Trooper Plan or result in the forgiveness in
whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by Trooper to any Person, (v)
limit the ability to amend or terminate any Trooper Plan or related trust or
(vi) result in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Code Section 280G or in the imposition of an excise Tax under Code
Section 4999 or Section 409A (or any corresponding provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law). Trooper has no obligation to pay any gross-up in respect
of any Tax under Code Section 4999 or Section 409A (or, in either case, any
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law).

 



52 (f) With respect to each Trooper Plan that is a Non-U.S. Plan, and, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Non-U.S. Plan, the liability of each insurer for any non-U.S. Plan funded
through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the benefits determined on an ongoing basis (actual or contingent) with
respect to all current or former participants under such Non-U.S. Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuation most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Plan, and none of the
contemplated transactions will cause such assets, insurance obligations or
book reserves to be less than such benefit obligations. Each such Non-U.S.
Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in
all material respects in good standing with each applicable Governmental Body.
No Trooper Plan that is a Non-U.S. Plan is a defined benefit pension plan.

4.17 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Trooper and each of its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
exemptions, consents, certificates, authorizations, registrations and other
approvals from Governmental Bodies required to operate their respective
businesses as it is being conducted as of the date hereof (collectively, the "
_Permits_ "), and all of such Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to obtain or have any such Permit would,
individually or in the aggregate, not reasonably be expected to have a Trooper
Material Adverse Effect, and no proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
Trooper, threatened to revoke, suspend, cancel, terminate or adversely modify
any such Permit. Neither Trooper nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material
violation of, or in default under, any Law, in each case applicable to Trooper
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and properties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 4.17_ shall not apply to Taxes,
employee benefit plans, environmental matters, labor and employment matters or
regulatory matters, which are the subjects exclusively of the representations
and warranties in _Section 4.11_, _Section 4.16_, _Section 4.18_, _Section
4.19_ and _Section 4.20_, respectively.

 

(b) None of Trooper, any of Troopers Subsidiaries, any of their respective
officers or employees or, to the knowledge of Trooper, any of its suppliers,
distributors, licensees or agents, or any other Person acting on behalf of
Trooper or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, has (i) made or
received any payments in violation of any Law (including the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), including any contribution, payment,
commission, rebate, promotional allowance or gift of funds or property or any
other economic benefit to or from any employee, official or agent of any
Governmental Body where either the contribution, payment, commission, rebate,
promotional allowance, gift or other economic benefit, or the purpose thereof,
was illegal under any Law (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)
(any such payment, a " _Prohibited Payment_ "); (ii) provided or received any
product or services in violation of any Law (including the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act) or (iii) been subject to any investigation by any
Governmental Body with regard to any Prohibited Payment.

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Trooper Material Adverse Effect:

(b) Trooper holds, and is and has been in compliance with, all authorizations,
licenses and permits required under Environmental Laws to operate its
business at the Trooper Real Property as presently conducted;

(d) No Hazardous Substance has ever been released, generated, treated,
contained, handled, used, manufactured, processed, buried, disposed of,
deposited or stored by Trooper or on, under or about any of the real property
occupied or used by Trooper. Trooper has not disposed of or released or
allowed or permitted the release of any Hazardous Substance at any real
property, including the Trooper Real Property, so as to give rise to Liability
for investigation costs, cleanup costs, response costs, corrective action
costs, personal injury, property damage, natural resources damages or
attorney fees under CERCLA or any other Environmental Laws; and

(e) To Troopers knowledge, there are no and have never been any Hazardous
Substances present on, at, in or under any real property currently or formerly
owned, leased or used by Trooper for which Trooper has, or may have,
Liability.

 

4.19 _Employment and Labor Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Trooper Material
Adverse Effect, (a) Trooper is not a party to or bound by any collective
bargaining agreement or other agreement with a labor union, works council or
other employee representative body (other than any statutorily mandated
agreement in non-U.S. jurisdictions), and there are no such agreements which
pertain to employees of Trooper in existence or in negotiation; (b) no
employees of Trooper are represented by a labor union, works council or other
employee representative body (other than any statutorily mandated
representation in non-U.S. jurisdictions); (c) Trooper has not experienced any

collective bargaining dispute within the past two (2) years; (d) Trooper will
not incur any notice, consultation or consent obligations with respect to any
labor union, works council or other employee representative body in connection
with the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and, (e) to Troopers knowledge, (i) there are no Actions
or any material disputes pending or threatened (A) between Trooper and any of
its employees or independent contractors or (B) by or before any Governmental
Body affecting Trooper concerning employment matters, and (ii) there is no
current campaign being conducted to solicit cards from or otherwise organize
employees of Trooper or to authorize a labor union, works council or other
employee representative body to request that the National Labor Relations
Board (or any other Governmental Body) certify or otherwise recognize such a
body with respect to employees of Trooper, and Trooper has not been subject
to an application by a labor union, works council or other employee
representative body to be declared a common or related employer under labor
relations legislation. Trooper is in compliance in all material 

 



54  respects with all Laws relating to the employment of labor, including all
such Laws relating to wages, hours, human rights, discrimination, pay equity,
employment equity, workers compensation, safety and health, worker
classification (including employee-independent contractor classification and
the proper classification of employees as exempt employees and non-exempt
employees), the _WARN_ and any similar foreign, state, provincial or local
"mass layoff" or "plant closing" Law. There has been no "mass layoff" or
"plant closing" (as defined by WARN or any similar foreign, state, provincial
or local Laws) with respect to Trooper within the six (6) months prior to the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, to Troopers knowledge, no current
executive, key employee or group of employees has given notice of termination
of employment or otherwise disclosed plans to Trooper or any of its
Subsidiaries to terminate employment with Trooper or any of its Subsidiaries
within the next twelve (12) months.

 

4.20 _FDA and Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Except as has not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Trooper Material Adverse Effect, Trooper
is, and since December 31, 2011, has been, in compliance with all Healthcare
Laws applicable to Trooper and its Products. Except as has not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Trooper Material Adverse Effect, the design, development, investigation,
manufacture, testing, sale, marketing and distribution of Products by or on
behalf of Trooper is being, and has been since December 31, 2011, conducted in
material compliance with all applicable Healthcare Laws, including, without
limitation, requirements relating to clinical and non-clinical research,
product approval or clearance, premarketing notification, labeling,
advertising and promotion, record-keeping, adverse event reporting, reporting
of corrections and removals, and current good manufacturing practices for
medical device products. Trooper and, to Troopers knowledge, any contract
manufacturers assisting in the manufacture of the Products or
Product components are, and, since December 31, 2011, have been, in
compliance with FDAs device registration and listing requirements to the
extent required by applicable Healthcare Laws insofar as they pertain to the
manufacture of Products or Product components for Trooper, except as has not
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Trooper Material Adverse Effect. Trooper has not received written
notification of any pending or threatened claim, suit, proceeding, hearing,
enforcement, audit, investigation, arbitration or other action from any
Governmental Body, including, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office
of Inspector General or any comparable state or federal Governmental Body
alleging potential or actual non-compliance by, or Liability of, Trooper under
any Healthcare Law.

 

(b) Trooper holds such Permits of Governmental Bodies required for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted, including, without limitation, those
Permits necessary to permit the design, development, pre-clinical and clinical
testing, manufacture, labeling, sale, shipment, distribution and promotion of
its Products in jurisdictions where it currently conducts such
activities with respect to each Product (collectively, the " _Trooper
Licenses_ "), except to the extent where the failure to hold such Permits
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Trooper Material Adverse Effect. Trooper has fulfilled and performed all of
its obligations with respect to each Trooper License and is in material
compliance with all terms and conditions of each Trooper License, and, to
Troopers 

 



55  knowledge, no event has occurred which allows, or after notice or lapse of
time would allow, revocation, suspension or termination thereof or would
result in any other impairment of the rights of the holder of any Trooper
License, except to the extent where the failure to be in material compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Trooper Material Adverse Effect. Trooper has not received any written
information or notification from the FDA or any other Governmental Body with
jurisdiction over the testing, marketing, sale, use, handling and control,
safety, efficacy, reliability, distribution or manufacturing of medical
devices which would reasonably be expected to lead to the denial of any
application for marketing approval or clearance currently pending before the
FDA or any other Governmental Body.

 

(c) All material filings, reports, documents, claims, submissions and notices
required to be filed, maintained or furnished to the FDA, state or other
Governmental Bodies have been so filed, maintained or furnished and were
complete and correct in all material respects on the date filed (or were
corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing), including adverse event
reports, medical device reports and reports of corrections and removals with
regard to the Products. All applications, notifications, submissions,
information, claims, reports, filings and other data and conclusions derived
therefrom utilized as the basis for or submitted in connection with any and
all requests for a Trooper License from the FDA or other Governmental Body
relating to Trooper or its businesses or the Products, when submitted to the
FDA or any other Governmental Body, whether oral, written or electronically
delivered, were true, accurate and complete in all material respects as of the
date of submission. Any necessary or required updates, changes, corrections or
modifications to such applications, notifications, submissions,
information, claims, reports, filings and other data have been submitted to
the FDA or other Governmental Body and as so updated, changed, corrected or
modified remain true, accurate and complete in all material respects, and do
not materially misstate any of the statements or information included therein
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

 

(d) Trooper has not received any written notice or other communication from
the FDA or any other Governmental Body contesting the pre-market clearance or
approval of, the uses of or the labeling and promotion of any of the Products.
No manufacturing site which assists in the manufacture of the Products or
Product components (whether Trooper-owned or operated or that of a
contract manufacturer for the Products or Product components) has been
subject to a Governmental Body (including the FDA) shutdown or import or
export detention, refusal or prohibition. Neither Trooper nor, to Troopers
knowledge, any manufacturing site which assists in the manufacture of any
material Products or material Product components (whether Trooper-owned or
operated, or that of a contract manufacturer for the Products or Product
components) has received, since December 31, 2011, any FDA Form 483 or other
Governmental Body notice of inspectional observations or adverse findings,
"warning letters," "untitled letters" or similar correspondence or notice from
the FDA or other Governmental Body alleging or asserting noncompliance with
any applicable Healthcare Laws or Trooper Licenses or alleging a lack of
safety or effectiveness from the FDA or any other Governmental Body, and, to
Troopers knowledge, there is no such action or proceeding pending or
threatened.

(e) The FDA has not mandated that Trooper recall any of its Products. There
are no recalls of any of Troopers Products contemplated by Trooper or
pending. Since

 



56  December 31, 2011, there have been no recalls (either voluntary or
involuntary), field notifications, field corrections, market withdrawals or
replacements, warnings, "dear doctor" letters, investigator notices, safety
alerts or other notices of action relating to an alleged lack of safety,
efficacy or regulatory compliance of any Product or Product component, or
seizures ordered or adverse regulatory actions taken (or, to Troopers
knowledge, threatened) by the FDA or any Governmental Body with respect to any
of the Products or Product components or any facilities where Products or
Product components are developed, designed, tested, manufactured,
assembled, processed, packaged or stored.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.20(f)_ of the Trooper Disclosure
Letter, there are no clinical trials that are being conducted as of the date
hereof by or on behalf of, or sponsored by, Trooper.

(g) Trooper is not the subject of any pending or, to the knowledge of
Trooper, threatened investigation regarding Trooper or the Products by the FDA
pursuant to the FDA Fraud Policy. Neither Trooper nor to the knowledge of
Trooper, any officer, employee, agent or distributor of Trooper has made an
untrue statement of material fact to the FDA or any other Governmental Body,
failed to disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any
other Governmental Body or committed an act, made a statement or failed to
make a statement that, at the time such disclosure was made, would reasonably
be expected to provide a basis for the FDA or any other Governmental Body to
invoke the FDA Fraud Policy or any similar policy. Neither Trooper nor, to
the knowledge of Trooper, any officer, employee, agent or distributor of
Trooper, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which
such Person could be excluded from participating in the federal health care
programs under Section 1128 of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended,
or any similar Law. No claims, actions, proceedings or investigation that
would reasonably be expected to result in a debarment or exclusion are pending
or, to the knowledge of Trooper, threatened, against Trooper or, to the
knowledge of Trooper, any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

4.21  _Brokerage_. Other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, no Person shall be entitled to any brokerage commissions,
finders fees or similar compensation in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based on any arrangement or agreement made by or on
behalf of Trooper. Ranger has been given access to a true and correct copy of
all Contracts entitling any person to any brokerage commissions, finders fees
or similar compensation in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby based on any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of Trooper,
together with all amendments, waivers or other changes thereto.

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_

 

6.01 _Investigation_.

(a) Each of Ranger and Trooper shall afford to the other party and to the
Representatives of such other party reasonable access during normal business
hours, during the Pre-Closing Period, to its and its Subsidiaries personnel
and properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any report,
schedule or other documents filed or received by it pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Law and with such additional financing, operating
and other data and information regarding Ranger and its Subsidiaries, as
Trooper may reasonably request in connection with activities related to the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Activities_ "), or regarding Trooper and its Subsidiaries, as Ranger
may reasonably request in connection with the Activities, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Ranger nor Trooper nor their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably
disrupt the operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a
violation of any agreement to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party ( _provided_ that Trooper or Ranger, as the case may be, has
used commercially reasonable efforts to find an alternative way to provide
the access or information contemplated by this _Section 6.01_), would cause a
risk of a loss of privilege to such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would
constitute a violation of any applicable Law or would otherwise disclose
competitively sensitive material.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
deemed to be Evaluation Material, as such term is used in, and shall be

following the execution of this Agreement, (A) Trooper and Ranger shall
jointly prepare a joint proxy statement (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") in
preliminary form, which shall contain each of the Trooper Recommendation and
Ranger Recommendation (unless, in either case, a Trooper Adverse
Recommendation Change or a Ranger Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, has occurred), and (B) Trooper shall prepare and file with the
SEC (i) a registration statement on Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement shall be included and (ii) a prospectus relating to the Trooper
Shares to be offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger (such
registration statement together with the amendments and supplements thereto,
the " _Registration Statement_ "). Trooper shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and Ranger shall reasonably cooperate with Trooper in such efforts,
to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. Each of Trooper and
Ranger shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to mail the
Joint Proxy Statement to its shareholders as promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

required to be taken under any applicable

issuance of Trooper Shares pursuant to this Agreement, and each party shall
furnish all information concerning Ranger, Trooper and the holders of capital
stock of Ranger and Trooper, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested by
another party in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or material correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Registration Statement shall be made by Trooper, or with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement shall be made by Ranger, Trooper or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Trooper shall advise Ranger,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Trooper Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. Each of Trooper and Ranger shall advise the other,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Ranger or Trooper, or
any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Ranger or Trooper which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to either Trooper Shareholders or
Ranger Shareholders, as applicable.

this Agreement, including the Merger (the " _Ranger Shareholders  Meeting_").
Subject to _Section 6.04(b)_ and _6.04(c)_ , Ranger will, through its
directors, recommend that Ranger Shareholders adopt this Agreement and will

and Trooper Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold

Meeting_"). Subject to _Section 6.04(e)_ and _6.04(f)_ , Trooper will,
through 

 



67  the Trooper Board, recommend that the Trooper Shareholders approve the
proposals to approve this Agreement and to issue shares in accordance with its
provisions and will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the
Trooper Shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
the Trooper Shareholders required by the rules of the NASDAQ or applicable
Law to obtain such approvals.

(c) Ranger and Trooper shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to hold
the Ranger Shareholders Meeting and the Trooper Shareholders Meeting on the
same date and as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

its and their respective Representatives to, promptly upon the execution of
this Agreement cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation with or involving any Person (other than
Trooper and its Affiliates) conducted heretofore by Ranger or any Subsidiary
thereof or any of its or their respective Representatives, with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, Ranger will immediately
discontinue access by any Person (other than Trooper and its Affiliates) to

hereof, Ranger shall request the return or destruction of all confidential,
non-public information provided to third parties that have entered into
confidentiality agreements with Ranger or any Subsidiary thereof since
October 1, 2012, relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to obtaining Ranger Shareholder
Approval, Ranger and the Ranger Board may take any actions described in
clause (ii) of this _Section 6.04(a)_ with respect to a third party if (x)
Ranger receives a written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Ranger from
such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, sought,
solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of this _Section
6.04_) and (y) such proposal constitutes, or the Ranger Board determines in
good faith that such proposal is reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal with respect to Ranger; _provided_ , that Ranger may deliver non-
public information to such third party only pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to Ranger with respect 

 



68  to confidentiality than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
(including with any standstill agreement or similar provisions) (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and sends a copy of such Agreement
to Trooper promptly following its execution. Nothing contained in this
_Section 6.04_ shall prohibit Ranger or the Ranger Board from taking and
disclosing to Ranger Shareholders a position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Ranger pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, if
the Ranger Board has reasonably determined in good faith that the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the Ranger Shareholders; _provided_ , that this sentence shall not permit the
Ranger Board to make a Ranger Adverse Recommendation Change, except to the
extent permitted by  _Section 6.04(b)_ or _Section 6.04(c)_.

(b) Neither the Ranger Board nor any committee thereof shall directly
or indirectly (i) withhold, withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Trooper, Holdco or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Trooper, Holdco or Merger
Sub), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Ranger Board or any such committee of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Ranger or (iii) fail to reaffirm or re-
publish the Ranger Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of being
requested by Trooper to do so (any action described in this sentence being
referred to as a " _Ranger Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, a change of Ranger Recommendation to "neutral" is a Ranger
Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining Ranger Shareholder Approval, and subject to Rangers
compliance at all times with the provisions of this _Section 6.04_ and
_Section 6.03_, in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to Ranger
that has not been withdrawn and did not result from a breach of _Section
6.04(a)_, the Ranger Board may make a Ranger Adverse Recommendation Change;
_provided_ , _however_ , that unless the Ranger Shareholders Meeting is
scheduled to occur within the next ten (10) Business Days, Ranger shall not
be entitled to exercise its right to make a Ranger Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to Ranger (x) until
five (5) Business Days after Ranger provides written notice to Trooper
advising Trooper that the Ranger Board has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and
including copies of all documents pertaining to such Superior Proposal; (y)
if during such five (5) Business Day period, Trooper irrevocably proposes any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement), unless Ranger Board determines in good faith, after good faith
negotiations between Ranger and Trooper (if such negotiations are requested by
Trooper) during such five (5) Business Day period (after and taking into
account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of such
alternative transaction proposal and expected timing of consummation and the
relative risks of non-consummation of the alternative transaction proposal and
the Superior Proposal) that such alternative transaction proposal is not at
least as favorable to Ranger and its shareholders as the Superior Proposal and
(z) unless the Ranger Board determines that the failure to make a Ranger
Adverse Recommendation Change would be a breach of its fiduciary obligations.

(c) Notwithstanding the first sentence of _Section 6.04(b)_, at any time
prior to obtaining Ranger Shareholder Approval, in connection with any
Intervening Event, the Ranger Board may make a Ranger Adverse Recommendation
Change, after the Ranger Board

 



69  (i) determines in good faith that the failure to make such Ranger Adverse
Recommendation Change would be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of Ranger, (ii) determines in good faith that the reasons for
making such Ranger Adverse Recommendation Change are independent of and
unrelated to any pending Acquisition Proposal with respect to Ranger and (iii)
provides written notice to Trooper (a " _Ranger Notice of Change_ ") advising
Trooper that the Ranger Board is contemplating making a Ranger Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the material facts and information
constituting the basis for such contemplated determination;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, unless the Ranger Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to
occur within the next five (5) Business Days, (x) the Ranger Board may not
make such a Ranger Adverse Recommendation Change until the fifth Business Day
after receipt by Trooper of a Ranger Notice of Change and (y) during such five
(5) Business Day period, at the request of Trooper, Ranger shall negotiate in
good faith with respect to any changes or modifications to this Agreement
which would allow the Ranger Board not to make such Ranger Adverse
Recommendation Change, consistent with its fiduciary duties.

 

(d) Trooper agrees that, except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and Trooper shall, and shall instruct its
Subsidiaries to, instruct its and their respective Representatives not to
directly or indirectly (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage
or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) or
take any other action that is reasonably expected to promote, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Trooper; (ii) participate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating
to Trooper or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties,
books or records of Trooper or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has
made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Trooper or (iii) enter into any
agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Trooper (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant
to this _Section 6.04_). Trooper shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
instruct its and their respective Representatives to, promptly upon the
execution of this Agreement cause to be terminated any solicitation,
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with or involving any Person (other
than Ranger and its Affiliates) conducted heretofore by Trooper or any
Subsidiary thereof or any of its or their respective Representatives, with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, Trooper shall
immediately discontinue access by any Person (other than Ranger and its
Affiliates) to any data room (virtual or otherwise) established by Trooper or
its Representatives for such purpose. Within ten (10) Business Days from the
date hereof, Trooper shall request the return or destruction of all
confidential, non-public information provided to third parties that have
entered into confidentiality agreements with Trooper or any
Subsidiary thereof since October 1, 2012, relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
obtaining the Trooper Shareholder Approval, Trooper and the Trooper Board may
take any actions described in clause (ii) of this _Section 6.04(d)_ with
respect to a third party if (x) Trooper receives a written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Trooper from such third party (and such Acquisition
Proposal was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly encouraged or
facilitated in violation of this _Section 6.04_) and (y) such proposal
constitutes, or the Trooper Board determines in good faith that such proposal
is reasonably be expected to lead to, a 

 



70  Superior Proposal with respect to Trooper; _provided_ , that Trooper may
deliver non-public information to such third party only pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (but in relation to Trooper rather than
Ranger). Nothing contained in this _Section 6.04_ shall prohibit Trooper or
the Trooper Board from taking and disclosing to the Trooper Shareholders a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Trooper
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any similar disclosure, if the Trooper Board has reasonably
determined in good faith that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to be a breach of its fiduciary duties; _provided_ , that this sentence shall
not permit the Trooper Board to make a Trooper Adverse Recommendation Change,
except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.04(e)_ or _Section 6.04(f)_. 

(e) Neither the Trooper Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (1) withhold, withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Ranger) or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Ranger), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Trooper Board or any such committee of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including the issuance of
Trooper Shares in the Merger; (ii) propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Trooper or (iii) fail to
reaffirm or re-publish the Trooper Recommendation within five (5) Business
Days of being requested by Ranger to do so (any action described in this
sentence being referred to as a " _Trooper Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
For the avoidance of doubt, a change of Trooper Recommendation to "neutral"
is a Trooper Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to obtaining the Trooper Shareholder Approval, and subject to
Troopers compliance at all times with the provisions of this _Section 6.04_
and _Section 6.03_, in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to
Trooper that has not been withdrawn and did not result from a breach of
_Section 6.04(d)_, the Trooper Board may make a Trooper Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless the Trooper
Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to occur with the next ten (10) Business
Days, Trooper shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Trooper
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect
to Trooper (x) until five (5) Business Days after Trooper provides written
notice to Ranger advising Ranger that the Trooper Board has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group making such Superior
Proposal and including copies of all documents pertaining to such Superior
Proposal; (y) if during such five (5) Business Day period, Ranger irrevocably
proposes any alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms
of this Agreement), unless the Trooper Board determines in good faith, after
good faith negotiations between Trooper and Ranger (if such negotiations are
requested by Ranger) during such five (5) Business Day period (after and
taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions
of such alternative transaction proposal and expected timing of consummation
and the relative risks of non-consummation of the alternative transaction
proposal and the Superior Proposal) that such alternative transaction proposal
is not at least as favorable to Trooper and its shareholders as the Superior
Proposal and (z) unless the Trooper Board determines that the failure to make
a Trooper Adverse Recommendation Change would be a breach of its fiduciary
obligations.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the first sentence of _Section 6.04(e)_, at any time
prior to obtaining the Trooper Shareholder Approval, in connection with any
Intervening Event, the Trooper Board may make a Trooper Adverse Recommendation
Change after the Trooper Board

 



71  (i) determines in good faith that the failure to make such Trooper Adverse
Recommendation Change would be a breach of its fiduciary duties, (ii)
determines in good faith that the reasons for making such Trooper Adverse
Recommendation Change are independent and unrelated to any pending Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Ranger and (iii) provides written notice to Ranger (a
" _Trooper Notice of Change_ ") advising Ranger that the Trooper Board is
contemplating making a Trooper Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying
the material facts and information constituting the basis for such
contemplated determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless the Trooper
Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to occur within the next five (5) Business
Days, (x) the Trooper Board may not make such a Trooper Adverse Recommendation
Change until the fifth Business Day after receipt by Ranger of the Trooper
Notice of Change and (y) during such five (5) Business Day period, at the
request of Ranger, Trooper shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any
changes or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the
Trooper Board not to make such Trooper Adverse Recommendation Change,
consistent with its fiduciary duties.

(g) The parties agree that in addition to the obligations of Ranger and
Trooper set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this _Section 6.04_, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, Ranger or Trooper, as
applicable, shall advise Trooper or Ranger, respectively, in writing of any
request for information or any Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party
received from any Person, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party, and the terms
and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or
negotiations, and Ranger or Trooper, as applicable, shall promptly provide to
Trooper or Ranger, respectively, copies of any written materials received
by Ranger or Trooper, as applicable, in connection with any of the foregoing
and the identity of the Person or group making any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking
place. Each of Ranger and Trooper agrees that it shall simultaneously provide
to the other any non-public information concerning itself or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal which was not previously provided to the other. Ranger and Trooper
shall keep Trooper and Ranger, respectively, fully informed of the status of
any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the parties and price
involved and any changes to any material terms and conditions thereof). Each
of Ranger and Trooper agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party or fail to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, any such standstill or similar agreement to which it is a party.

6.05 _Regulatory Approvals; Additional Agreements_.

 

(a) Within twenty (20) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Ranger and
Trooper each shall file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice Notification and Report
Forms relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Within
twenty (20) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Ranger and Trooper
each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file all other documents
required to be filed with any Governmental Body pursuant to the merger
notification or control Laws of applicable foreign jurisdictions with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



72 (b) Trooper and Ranger each shall promptly (i) supply the other with any
information required in order to effectuate the filings described in this
_Section 6.05_, (ii) supply additional information reasonably required by a
Governmental Body and, (iii) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Body, keep each other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
communications received from any Governmental Body. Neither Trooper nor
Ranger shall independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Body in connection with such
filings without using commercially reasonable efforts to give (to the extent
feasible and appropriate) the other prior notice of the meeting or
conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Body, a reasonable
opportunity to attend or participate. The parties shall reasonably consult and
cooperate with one another and permit the other party or its counsel to
review in advance any proposed written communication by such party to any
Governmental Body in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or relating to
antitrust or merger control Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of Ranger and Trooper shall (i) give the other party prompt notice of
the commencement or written threat of commencement of any legal proceeding by
or before any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other party informed as to the status of any
such legal proceeding or threat and (iii) reasonably cooperate with each
other and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Subject to the conditions and upon the terms of this Agreement, each of
Trooper and Ranger shall use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to, and
in accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken
promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to carry out the intent and purposes of
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
conditions and upon the terms of this Agreement, each party to this Agreement
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cooperate with the other
party, execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements
and instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by
the other party to evidence or reflect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the execution and delivery of all documents,
certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary for all filings
hereunder); (ii) to give all notices required to be made and given by such
party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) to obtain each approval, consent, ratification, permission and waiver
of authorization required to be obtained from a Governmental Body or a party
to any material Contract; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall (A) Ranger or Trooper
or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay any fee, penalty
or other consideration to any third party for any approval, consent,
ratification, permission or waiver of authorization

 



73  required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts or (B) the
receipt of any such approval, consent, ratification, permission or waiver of
authorization required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts
be a condition to any partys obligations hereunder.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
neither Trooper nor Ranger, by itself or on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, shall, without the prior written consent of the other, divest
or agree to divest any rights to the extent such divestiture, individually or
together with other divestitures, involves assets that generated U.S. revenue
in excess of $15 million during the twelve (12) months ended September 30,
2014 (a " _Restraint_ "), and (ii) Trooper and Ranger, on behalf of
themselves or on behalf of any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, agree to
divest or commit to divest rights to the extent such divestiture, individually
or together with other divestitures, relates to assets that generated U.S.
revenue less than $15 million during the twelve (12) months ended September
30, 2014; _provided_ , _however_ , Ranger shall control the terms of, and
assets included in, any such divestiture;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
Ranger shall use commercially reasonable efforts to contest any divestiture
proposed by a Governmental Body.

 

6.06 _Termination of Ranger ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, Ranger shall
take all actions necessary or desirable to (a) provide that no offering
period shall commence under the Ranger ESPP following the date hereof, (b)
provide that the offering period in effect on the date hereof under the Ranger
ESPP shall terminate on December 31, 2014, and (c) terminate the Ranger ESPP
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any Ranger Shares acquired
after the date hereof under the Ranger ESPP shall be treated as outstanding
Ranger Shares for purposes of _Section 2.08(a)(ii)_.

 

6.07 _Employee and Labor Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to the compensation and benefits to be provided after the
Effective Time in respect of individuals who are employees of Ranger or its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Ranger Employees_ ") and to
individuals who are employees of Trooper or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (the " _Trooper Employees_ " and, together with Ranger
Employees, the " _Employees_ ") who are not represented by a union or labor
organization with respect to the terms and conditions of their employment nor
employed pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement,
Ranger and Trooper have agreed that, consistent with the current practices of
Ranger and Trooper, the Surviving Corporation and Trooper shall seek, after
the Effective Time, to attract and retain superior quality executive,
managerial, technical and administrative personnel in every market in which
they conduct activities and will generally implement compensation and benefit
plans and policies necessary or appropriate to achieve this objective. It is
the specific intention that, in each of the markets in which they operate,
the compensation and benefit programs of the Surviving Corporation and Trooper
(i) will be competitive with those provided generally in their industry, both
with respect to the type and variety of programs as well as the level of
benefits afforded, and (ii) will treat similarly-situated Ranger Employees and
Trooper Employees on a substantially comparable basis, taking into account all
relevant factors, including duties, geographic location,
tenure, qualifications and abilities.

 



74 (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Trooper and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Employees after the Effective Time
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Ranger Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with Ranger and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time
for purposes of vesting, benefits eligibility and level of benefits, and each
Trooper Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
Trooper and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time for such purposes, to
the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Ranger Plan or Trooper Plan, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service crediting shall not be
required (i) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or
(ii) to the extent Ranger Employees and Trooper Employees are equally affected
without regard to whether employment before the Effective Time was with Ranger
and its Subsidiaries or Trooper and its Subsidiaries (for example, in the
event a New Plan is adopted for Ranger Employees and Trooper Employees under
which no participants receive credit for service before the effective date of
the New Plan). In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b), Trooper shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) each Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
a comparable Ranger Plan or Trooper Plan in which such Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), and, (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Employee, pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan are waived for
such Employee and his or her covered dependents, and any eligible expenses
incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins are taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Trooper and Ranger shall take all actions necessary or desirable to cause
(i) each Trooper Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time to become fully vested and exercisable at the Effective Time
and to remain exercisable for the remainder of its term and (ii) each Trooper
RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to become
fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions at the Effective Time.
Trooper shall provide Ranger with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to
comment upon, all resolutions and other documents as may be required to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 6.07(c)_.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section 6.07_ shall not be construed to prevent
the termination of employment of any Employee or the amendment or termination
of any particular Ranger Plan or Trooper Plan, to the extent permitted by its
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to, or does, constitute the establishment or adoption of, or
amendment to, any Ranger Plan or Trooper Plan, and no person participating in
any such plan shall have any claim or cause of action, under ERISA or
otherwise, in respect of the provisions of this Agreement as it relates to any
such plan or otherwise.

 



75 6.08 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Trooper and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
present and former director, officer and employee of Ranger, each present and
former director, member of the board of directors, officer and employee of any
of Rangers Subsidiaries and any fiduciary under any Ranger Plan (in each
case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the
" _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of Ranger or a
member of the board of directors, officer, employee or fiduciary of any of its
Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Ranger Plan, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with respect to any acts
or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent that Ranger
would have been permitted under applicable Law and the
applicable Organizational Documents (and, to the extent not contrary to
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents, any indemnification agreement)
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person, and Trooper
or the Surviving Corporation shall also promptly advance expenses as incurred
in advance of any final disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent that Ranger or its
applicable Subsidiary would have been permitted under applicable Law or its
Organizational Documents (and, to the extent not contrary to applicable Law or
its Organizational Documents, any indemnification agreement) in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law or the applicable Organizational Documents (as in
effect on the date hereof), to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether a directors, officers, employees or fiduciarys conduct
complied with the standards set forth under applicable Law and the applicable
Organizational Documents (or the applicable organizational documents of a
Subsidiary or Ranger Plan) shall be made by independent counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party. In the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (i) neither Trooper nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (and in which indemnification could be sought by
Indemnified Parties hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing, and (ii) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of such matter. The parties agree
that this _Section 6.08(a)_ does not purport to limit any rights that any
Indemnified Party may have under any employment agreement, indemnification
agreement, or Ranger Plan in effect on the date of this Agreement and
disclosed to either party prior to the execution hereof, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
materially adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individual.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Trooper shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of

 



76  expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers
or employees, as the case may be, of Ranger or its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective Organizational Documents or in any agreement to which Ranger
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which rights shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by Law. No
such provision in any Organizational Document or other agreement of the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Ranger shall be amended, modified
or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder to any such individual with respect to acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, all directors, officers and employees and all
fiduciaries currently indemnified under a Ranger Plan who become directors,
officers, employees or fiduciaries under a Trooper Plan shall be entitled to
the indemnity, advancement and exculpation rights and protections afforded to
directors, officers and employees or fiduciaries under the applicable Trooper
Plan. From and after the Effective Time, Trooper shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this _Section 6.08_ without limit as to time.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, in its sole discretion, either (i)
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time for the Persons who, as of the date of this
Agreement, are covered by Rangers directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") DandO Insurance with recognized insurance companies and with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in Rangers existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or,
if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Corporation (or its successor)
shall purchase the best available DandO Insurance from a recognized insurance
company for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and with
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in Rangers existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; or (ii) obtain and fully pay
for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with recognized insurance companies for the
Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by
Rangers existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as Rangers existing DandO Insurance
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated by this Agreement), with respect to Rangers DandO
Insurance.

 

(d) If Trooper or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Trooper or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.08_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Organizational Documents of Ranger or the comparable documents of any of
Rangers Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws in effect on
the date of this Agreement and, in the case of such documents and 

 



77  Contracts, disclosed to Trooper prior to the execution hereof, and Trooper
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under
all indemnification agreements entered into by Ranger or any of its

case including all documented fees and expenses of law firms, commercial

_Defaulting Party_ "), and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
(the " _Non-Defaulting Party_ ") commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Defaulting Party for the payment set forth in this _Section
8.03_, the Defaulting Party shall pay to the Non-Defaulting Party its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,

this Agreement could have been terminated under a different provision or could
have been terminated at an earlier or later time.
