Re: Nextel Holdings S.a r.l.

Dear Edward,

 

We refer to the Shareholders Agreement (the " _Shareholders Agreement_ ") in
relation to Nextel Holdings S.a r.l. (the " _Nextel Holdings_ "), dated June
5, 2017, among the Company, Ice Group Brazil Holdings BV (formerly known as
AINMT Brazil Holdings B.V.), NII International Telecom (" _NII Telecom_ "),
NII Brazil Holdings S.a r.l. (the " _Company_ ") and NII Holdings, Inc. ("
_NII Parent_ ").

Also, we refer to the Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "),
dated March 18, 2019, among America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V. (" _Purchaser_ "),
NII International Holdings S.a r.l. (" _NIIH_ "), AI Brazil Holdings
B.V. (formerly known as Ice Group Brazil Holdings BV, hereinafter " _AI
Brazil_ " and, collectively with its Affiliates, " _Access_ ," " _you_ " and "
_your_ ") and NII Parent. NII Parent, NIIH and AI Brazil are sometimes
referred to herein, collectively, as the " _Parties_ ," and each as a "
_Party_ ". Capitalized terms used but not defined in this letter have the
meaning given to them in the Shareholders Agreement or Purchase Agreement, as
applicable.

The Parties wish to document certain understandings in respect of the transfer
by (i) NIIH of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the
Company and (ii) AI Brazil of the AI Brazil Shares indirectly to Purchaser
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the application of the Shareholders
Agreement to such transfer.

   

In consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants contained
in this letter (this " _Letter Agreement_ ") and the Purchase Agreement, the
Parties hereby agree as follows:



   1. |

NII Parent represents and warrants to Access that it has provided to Access
all material information related to NII Parents sale of its interest in
Nextel Holdings pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the estimated return to
NII Parents stockholders relating to such sale and the anticipated winding up
and dissolution of NII Parent. NII Parent will provide to Access true and
correct copies of all material written information provided to any
stockholders of NII Parent in connection with soliciting or obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval. Further, NII Parent confirms that, except
for the Purchase Agreement, there are no agreements between NII Parent, NIIH
and any of the Entities, on the one hand, and the Purchaser or its Affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreement, on the
other hand, and that neither NII Parent, nor any of its Affiliates, will
enter into any such agreements between signing and closing under the Purchase
Agreement without the consent of Access (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).  

---|--- 



   2. |

NII Parent shall promptly (and in any event, within 48 hours) advise Access
orally and in writing (which may be by email) of the receipt by NII Parent or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any
request to engage in discussions or negotiations with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information that would reasonably be
expected to relate to an Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such
notice, provide to Access the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the third party making any
such Acquisition Proposal) and of any changes thereto. NII Parent shall
promptly advise Access orally and in writing (which may be by email) of the
commencement of any discussions with any third party or its Representatives
regarding any Acquisition Proposal by such third party. NII Parent shall keep
Access informed (orally and in writing) in all material respects on a timely
basis of the status and details (including, within 48 hours after the
occurrence of any amendment, modification, material development or
negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request, including promptly
furnishing to Access copies of any written Acquisition Proposal, any other
written materials that describe any such Acquisition Proposal, any material
correspondence relating thereto, and draft documentation with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal. 

---|--- 



   3. |

In the event that the Parent Board has determined that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, NII Parent shall, not less than seven (7)
Business Days prior to accepting such Superior Proposal, notify Access orally
and in writing (which may be by email) that it believes that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and such written notice (which may
be by email) shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the Person making the proposal) and
contemporaneously furnish to Access a copy of the relevant acquisition
agreement or other relevant transaction documents. In the event that NII
Parent determines to accept the aforementioned Acquisition Proposal, NII
Parent further undertakes to (a) prior to terminating the Purchase
Agreement, reasonably cooperate and consult with Access with respect to such
Superior Proposal, including by providing Access a reasonable opportunity to
participate in discussions with respect to the acquisition of the AI Brazil
Shares with the Person making the Superior Proposal so that Access may ensure
that such Person will acquire the AI Brazil Shares (directly or indirectly) on
terms acceptable to Access, and (b) assume all liability for any action
brought by Purchaser arising from or relating to (i) the termination of 

---|--- 
 



2

         |  the Purchase Agreement by NII Parent or by Purchaser as a
result of a breach by NII Parent or the Company, or (ii) NII Parents failure
to pay the Company Break-Up Fee in accordance with _Section 3.4_ of the
Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Parent
terminates the Purchase Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a
Superior Proposal, (A) NII Parent will pay the Company Break-Up Fee in
accordance with the terms of Section 3.4 of the Purchase Agreement, (B) to the
extent NII Parent is not reimbursed (directly or indirectly) for the amount
of the Company Break-Up Fee, then (i) the first $25,000,000 of the purchase
price under such Superior Proposal shall be paid to NII Parent as
reimbursement for NII Parents payment of the Company Break-Up Fee, and (ii)
Access shall not have any right to any reimbursement or payment (directly or
indirectly) of any portion of the Company Break-Up Fee by a Person making such
Superior Proposal. 
---|--- 



   4. |

If NIIH or NII Parent terminates the Purchase Agreement in order to accept a
Superior Proposal, prior to accepting such Superior Proposal, NII Parent, NII
Telecom and the Company and each of their respective Affiliates will comply
with the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, including with the provisions of
Section 2.5 or 2.6 thereof; provided, however, that upon receipt of a Sale
Notice, Access will have seven (7) Business Days to exercise its option to
purchase the Offered Shares. 

---|--- 



   5. |

Notwithstanding Paragraph 4 and the rights of Access under the Shareholders
Agreement, in the event that NII Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, (a) NII Parent hereby undertakes that, if NIIH or its Affiliates
exercise the drag along rights pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Shareholders
Agreement in connection with any such Superior Proposal, (i) Access will only
be obligated to indemnify the purchaser under such Superior Proposal for
matters relating to fundamental representations applicable to Accesss
interests in Nextel Holdings in substantially the same form as set out in
Article 5 of the Purchase Agreement or any breach by Access of its covenants
under the definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, (ii) Access will not
be obligated to participate in or otherwise contribute to any indemnification
escrow, holdback, reserve or other contingent obligation that may be part of
any Superior Proposal, (iii) the covenants and obligations applicable to
Access in any such Superior Proposal will be on substantially the same terms
contemplated under the Purchase Agreement and (iv) the consideration to be
received by Access for the sale of the AI Brazil Shares shall meet the minimum
threshold set forth in Section 2.8 of the Shareholders Agreement, and (v)
Access shall not be required to contribute (directly or indirectly) to any
costs and/or expenses of NII Parent or its Affiliates in respect of either the
transaction pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and/or a Superior Proposal,
and (b) Access shall have the right to elect to exercise the tag along rights
pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Shareholders Agreement in connection with any
such Superior Proposal, irrespective of the form of such transaction, and if
Access elects to exercise such rights, (i) Access will only be obligated to
indemnify the purchaser under such Superior Proposal for matters relating to
fundamental representations applicable to Accesss interests in Nextel
Holdings in substantially the same form as set out in Article 5 of the
Purchase Agreement or any breach by Access of its covenants under the
definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, (ii) Access will not
be obligated to participate in or otherwise contribute to any indemnification
escrow, holdback, reserve or other contingent obligation that may be part of
any Superior Proposal, (iii) the covenants and obligations applicable to
Access in any such Superior Proposal will be on substantially the same terms
contemplated under the Purchase Agreement and (iv) Access shall not be
required to contribute (directly or indirectly) to any costs and/or expenses
of NII Parent or its Affiliates in respect of either the transaction pursuant
to the Purchase 

---|--- 
 



3

         |  Agreement and/or a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding anything
in the Shareholders Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of giving effect
to this Paragraph 5, each reference to "Retained NII Group" in Section 2.7 of
the Shareholders Agreement (and the definitions used therein), shall be deemed
to include NII Parent and each of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries. 
---|--- 
 



   6. |

NII Parent will not refer to Access or its Affiliates in the Proxy Statement
required under the Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent of
Access, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless
such disclosure with respect to Access or its Affiliates is otherwise required
by applicable Law, in which case, NII Parent will provide Access a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure. 

---|--- 



   7. |

NII Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Access and its Affiliates
and, in each case, their respective officers, directors and employees (the "
_Access Indemnitees_ ") from, against and in respect of any and all Damages
that the Access Indemnitees actually suffer resulting from an action or
proceeding brought or threatened in writing by a stockholder or bondholder of
NII Parent or any third party (other than Purchaser (any indemnification for
which shall be covered pursuant to paragraph 3 above) or any Affiliate of
Access) making a claim specifically in relation to the transactions
contemplated under the Purchase Agreement, this Letter Agreement or any
Superior Proposal. The Parties acknowledge and agree that NII Parents
indemnification obligation hereunder shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect if no claim or threat is brought by an NII Parent stockholder
or bondholder or a third party prior to the date that is 120 days immediately
following the closing date of the Purchase Agreement or Superior Proposal, as
applicable.  

---|--- 



   8. |

NII Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AI Brazil from and
against any and all Damages that AI Brazil actually suffers resulting from,
arising out of or incurred in connection with: 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

any and all Unpaid Transaction Expenses; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

a reduction in the portion of the Purchase Price payable to AI Brazil pursuant
to Article 2 of the Purchase Agreement as a result of, or claims by Purchaser
under the Purchase Agreement arising out of or related to: (i) any Accrued Tax
Contingencies or any contingent Tax liabilities reflected in Section 6.6 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Attachment D to Section 6.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; (ii) any Taxes imposed on NII Parent or any of
its Affiliates other than the Entities; (iii) the portion of Pre-Closing Taxes
in excess of the AI Brazil Percentage of such Pre-Closing Taxes that are
directly related to the operations of the Entities in the Ordinary Course and
are properly included as current liabilities in the calculation of Net
Working Capital in accordance with the Accounting Principles; or (iv) any
Taxes included in the calculation of Net Working Capital that were incurred
outside of the Ordinary Course or that were improperly included in
the calculation of Net Working Capital pursuant to the Accounting Principles; 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

any Liabilities or reduction in Purchase Price associated with any
Intercompany Notes Modification or Requested Notes Modification; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

any amounts payable under the Retention Plan, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are consummated. 

---|---|--- 
 



4

       9. |

NII Parent represents and warrants to Access that no Transaction Expenses have
been paid by Nextel Holdings or any of the Entities. From the date of the
Purchase Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of the
Purchase Agreement, NII Parent will not, and NII Parent will cause the
Entities not to, amend, change, waive or otherwise modify the Intercompany
Notes or agree to a Requested Notes Modification without the prior written
consent of Access (which may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Accesss
sole discretion, for any reason or for no reason, and without liability).  

---|--- 



   10. |

At least five (5) Business Days prior to NII Parent delivering the Estimated
Closing Statement or Payout Schedule to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.2(c)
of the Purchase Agreement, NII Parent will prepare and deliver to Access for
its review and approval, a draft of the Estimated Closing Statement and Payout
Schedule showing the elements thereof specified in the Purchase Agreement,
including the Estimated AI Brazil Amount. NII Parent and Access will work
together in good faith to agree the contents of the Estimated Closing
Statement and Payout Schedule and NII Parent shall not submit the Estimated
Closing Statement or Payout Schedule to Purchaser or agree any changes to the
form or content thereof, without the prior written consent of Access (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Parties
agree that the terms herein shall apply mutatis mutandis in respect of any
Superior Proposal. 

---|--- 

At least five (5) Business Days prior to delivering the 2020 Transaction
Budget to Purchaser, NII Parent will prepare and deliver to Access for its
review and approval, a draft of the 2020 Transaction Budget, including the
amount of proposed capital expenditures to be included therein. NII Parent
and Access will work together in good faith to agree the contents of the 2020
Transaction Budget and NII Parent shall not submit the 2020 Transaction Budget
to Purchaser or agree any changes to the form or content thereof, without the
prior written consent of Access (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).



   11. |

NII Parent will provide information to, and reasonably consult and cooperate
with, Access in respect of any of the undertakings or actions of NII Parent
in relation to the calculation and determination of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement, including by facilitating
such access, during regular business hours, to the books and records of the
Seller and the Entities and the employees and other service providers
(including accountants and other advisors) to the Entities as Access may
reasonably request; provided that neither Parent nor Seller will be
required to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of Parent or Seller, as applicable, would (a) waive
the protection of an attorney-client privilege or (b) would violate any
confidentiality obligations to which Parent or Seller is bound; provided,
further, that Parent or Seller, as applicable, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to permit such inspection or provide such information in a
manner that would not result in the waiver of such privilege or violate such
confidentiality obligations, including, in the case of clause (b), by
obtaining the consent of such third party if so requested by Access. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, NII Parent shall promptly (and in
any event, within 48 hours) advise Access orally and in writing (which may be
by email) of the receipt by NII Parent or any of its Affiliates or
representatives of the Closing Statement or any communication from Purchaser
in respect of the calculation of the Final Purchase Price, which notice shall
include a copy of the Closing Statement or such other communication (if in
writing). NII Parent and Access will work together in good faith to agree the
contents of any Closing Statement Dispute Notice and NII Parent shall not
agree to the Closing Statement the Final Purchase Price, or any element
thereof, or submit any Closing Statement Dispute Notice to Purchaser, without
the prior written  

---|--- 
 



5

         |  consent of Access (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or conditioned). If NII Parent delivers a Closing Statement Dispute Notice,
then NII Parent and Access will work together in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Items with Purchaser during the Resolution Period. NII Parent shall
keep Access fully informed of all proposals, negotiations and communications
in respect of the attempt to resolve any Disputed Items or the submission of
any Unresolved Items to the Independent Accountant (including by providing
Access with copies of all related support and backup materials) and shall not
agree to any compromise, settlement or resolution of any such Disputed Item or
any payment in respect thereof, without the prior written consent of Access
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 
---|--- 



   12. |

NII Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to notify Access prior to
exercising any of its termination rights under Section 3.4 of the Purchase
Agreement and shall, to the extent practicable, consult with Access prior to
exercising such rights. In addition, NII Parent shall provide to Access, as
promptly as practicable, copies of any notices delivered by NII Parent (or
received by NII Parent) pursuant to Sections 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6 of the Purchase
Agreement. 

---|--- 



   13. |

To the extent NII Parent is provided the opportunity to review and comment on
any submission or communication required in connection with the process of
obtaining the Regulatory Approval or Antitrust Approval, NII shall provide
Access as much time as reasonably practicable to review and comment on, and
will take into account and reflect any reasonable comments from Access with
respect to, any such submissions or communications. 

---|--- 



   14. |

NII Parent undertakes to Access that it will procure that the Company and its
Subsidiaries will conduct business in the ordinary course (in accordance with
the business plan, past practice and Section 8.2 of the Purchase Agreement)
(the " _Ordinary Course_ ") during the period between signing and closing of
the Purchase Agreement. Further NII Parent undertakes not to operate the
business of the Entities, or permit the business of any of the Entities to be
operated, in a manner that is outside of the Ordinary Course or that would
intentionally result in a negative impact on the purchase price adjustment
under the Purchase Agreement. 

---|--- 



   15. |

The Parties acknowledge that between signing and closing of the Purchase
Agreement or any Superior Proposal, Nextel Holdings shall require equity
funding. The Parties hereby agree to procure that Nextel Holdings shall
undertake such equity capital raising at a valuation equal to that established
by the price mechanism under the Purchase Agreement or any Superior Proposal.
In addition, any equity capital raising will be undertaken pursuant to the
terms and conditions set out in the Shareholders Agreement. 

---|--- 



   16. |

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Paragraph 16, without
prejudice to the rights and obligations of the relevant parties under the
Investment Agreement (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement) and the
undertaking agreement entered into on October 15, 2018, by among NII Parent
and AI Brazil (the " _Undertaking Letter_ ") in respect of the proceeds of an
escrow established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, dated January 26, 2015,
among NIU Holdings LLC (" _NIU_ "), Citibank, N.A. and ATandT Mobility Holdings
B.V. (as permitted assignee) (the " _Mexico Escrow_ "), the Parties hereby
agree in connection with the transactions contemplated under the Purchase
Agreement and subject to Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence that: 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Until Closing of the Purchase Agreement or Superior Proposal, 

---|---|--- 
 



6

         | (i) |

to the extent payment is made from the Mexico Escrow to NIU (the " _Released
Amount_ "), NII Parent will procure that NIU transfers the Released Amount
into a separate bank account (the " _Escrow Bank Account_ ") designated to
hold only the Released Amount and shall not use such monies for any reason
other than those set out herein or pursuant to the Undertaking Letter; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Parties otherwise agree that the terms of the Undertaking Letter are
hereby suspended until Closing (of the Purchase Agreement or Superior
Proposal) and upon Closing of the Purchase Agreement (or Superior Proposal)
shall terminate. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Upon Closing of the Purchase Agreement or a Superior Proposal, as applicable,
and thereafter, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a Released
Amount, NII Parent will cause NIU to pay to Access the first $10,000,000 of
the Released Amount (the " _Initial Release_ ") from the applicable escrow
account at Citibank N.A. and an amount equal to 6% of all additional proceeds
released from the Mexico Escrow after the Initial Release (the " _Escrow
Arrangement_ "). 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If the Purchase Agreement is terminated, the foregoing Escrow Arrangement
shall no longer apply, and the terms and conditions of the Undertaking Letter
shall be reinstated and be in full force and effect. 

---|---|--- 



   17. |

The Parties hereby further agree that, whether or not expressly referenced
herein, the terms of this Letter Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis in
respect of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal (including any
proposal which in substance is an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal
but is made following acceptance and in respect of a Superior Proposal)
except in the case of the AI Brazil consent right in paragraph 9, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned in respect of any other
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal. 

---|--- 
 

Clauses 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.8 and 13.13 of the Purchase
Agreement shall apply to and are hereby incorporated into the terms of this
Letter Agreement, _mutatis mutandis._ The Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the execution of the Purchase Agreement by the parties thereto will
in no way be deemed or constitute a breach by any Party of the Shareholders
Agreement, provided, that the Parties agree to exercise their respective
rights in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement.

If the above reflects our understanding and agreement with respect to the
foregoing matters correctly, please so confirm by signing the enclosed copy of
this Letter Agreement.
