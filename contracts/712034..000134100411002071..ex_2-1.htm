exchange therefor.

  

  

(iii) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately

distributions and other amounts payable in accordance with Section 3.2(c).

  

  

(iv) The Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution of

outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock. The Agent shall, pursuant to

the Persons who received Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution, in respect
of the outstanding shares of MWV Common Stock held by holders of record of MWV
Common Stock on the Record Date, all of the shares of Company Common Stock
into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock that were distributed in the
Distribution have been converted pursuant to the Merger. Each Person entitled
to receive Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled to
receive in respect of the shares of Spinco Common Stock distributed to such
Person a certificate or book-entry authorization representing the number of
whole shares of Company Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Company Common Stock, as contemplated by Section 3.3) (and any dividends or
distributions and other amounts pursuant to Section 3.2(c)). The Agent shall
not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to
the Company Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that
it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect thereto for the account of Persons entitled thereto.

  

  

(c) Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock that are not able to be
distributed by the Agent promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a
legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such previously
undistributed shares of Company Common Stock, there shall be paid to the
record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, without interest (i) at
the time of the distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.3 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such shares and a
payment date subsequent to the distribution of such shares payable with
respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall
deposit in the Distribution Fund all such dividends and distributions.

  

  

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Spinco Common Stock. All shares of Company
Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Spinco Common Stock (including any
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.3) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Spinco Common Stock.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(e) Termination of Distribution Fund. Any portion of the Distribution Fund
made available to the Agent that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders of Spinco on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any former stockholders of
Spinco who have not received shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
this ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment of
their claim for Company Common Stock and any dividends, distributions or cash
in lieu of fractional shares with respect to Company Common Stock (subject to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law).

  

  

(f) No Liability. Neither MWV, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Merger
Sub, the Agent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Spinco
Common Stock or any holder of shares of MWV Common Stock for shares of Company
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with
respect to Spinco Common Stock) or cash properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

transfer books of Spinco shall be closed and no transfer shall be made of any
shares of capital stock of Spinco that were outstanding as of the Effective
Time.

and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Spinco Common Stock such amounts as they determine
in good faith are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

  

  

Section 3.3 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Company Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Company Common Stock
that a holder of shares of Spinco Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated. The Agent will cause
the whole shares obtained thereby to be sold, in the open market or otherwise
as reasonably directed by MWV, and in no case later than three (3) Business
Days after the Effective Time. The Agent will make available the net proceeds
thereof, after deducting any required withholding Taxes and brokerage charges,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MWV

  

  

  

Except as otherwise disclosed or identified in (i) the MWV SEC Documents filed
on or prior to the date hereof (excluding any risk factor disclosure and
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer
included in such MWV SEC Documents that are predictive, forward-looking or
primarily cautionary in nature) or (ii) subject to Section 11.4(b), the
corresponding section of the Disclosure Letter delivered by MWV to the Company
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "MWV Disclosure
Letter"), MWV hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

  

  

Section 5.1 Organization; Qualification. MWV is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
MWV and the MWV Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate their properties and assets that are intended to be
Conveyed to the Spinco Group pursuant to the Separation Agreement. Each of the
CandOP Entities is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the CandOP Business owns, leases or operates properties,
or where the nature of the CandOP Business operated by it makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Spinco.

  

  

Section 5.2 Corporate Authority; No Violation.

  

  

(a) MWV has the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. Assuming the accuracy of the Company's
representations and warranties in Section 7.20, the execution, delivery and
performance by MWV of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on the part of MWV, except for such further action of the MWV Board
required to establish the Record Date and the Distribution Date, and the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

effectiveness of the declaration of the Distribution by the MWV Board (which
is subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of the conditions set forth in the Separation Agreement). The
execution, delivery and performance of any other Transaction Agreement to
which it is a party or as of the Effective Time will be a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby have been, or will be as
of the Effective Time, duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on
the part of MWV, except for such further action of the MWV Board required to
establish the Record Date and the Distribution Date, and the effectiveness of
the declaration of the Distribution by the MWV Board (which is subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in the Separation Agreement). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by MWV and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, Spinco and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding agreement of MWV, enforceable against MWV in
accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be

benefit of any Spinco Employee and "Spinco Employee" means any individual who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is employed primarily in the CandOP
Business, including any individual absent due to short-term disability,
vacation, holiday or approved leave of absence, including military leave and
leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, but excluding any individual
absent due to long-term disability and excluding those individuals listed on
Section 6.11(a)(ii) of the MWV Disclosure Letter. MWV has heretofore delivered
or made available to the Company true and complete copies of each Spinco
Benefit Plan and any amendments thereto (if the plan is not a written plan, a
description thereof), any related trust or other funding vehicle, any reports
or summaries required under ERISA or the Code for the most recent reporting
period and the most recent determination letter received from the IRS (if any)
with respect to each such plan intended to qualify under Section 401 of the
Code.

  

  

(b) No material liability under Title IV (including Sections 4069 and 4212(c)
of ERISA) or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by MWV or any of the MWV
Subsidiaries (with respect to the CandOP Business only), Spinco, any of the
Spinco Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them (with respect to any
ERISA Affiliate of MWV or any of the MWV Subsidiaries, with respect to the
CandOP Business only that has not been satisfied in full), and no condition
exists that would reasonably be expected to result in MWV or any MWV
Subsidiary (with respect to the CandOP Business only), Spinco, any of the Spinco
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them (with respect to any ERISA
Affiliate of MWV or any of the MWV Subsidiaries, with respect to the CandOP
Business only) incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums
due the PBGC as of the Distribution Date. With respect to each MWV Benefit
Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, (i) no reportable event within the
meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the thirty (30)-day notice
requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the occurrence
of any such reportable event; and (ii) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings
to terminate any MWV Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of MWV, no condition
exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which
would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of,
or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such MWV Benefit Plan. The
present value of accrued benefits under each MWV Benefit Plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA, determined based upon the actuarial assumptions used for
funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's
actuary with respect to such plan, did not exceed, as of its latest valuation
date, the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such
accrued benefits.

  

  

(c) No MWV Benefit Plan is or will be at the Effective Time a "multiemployer
pension plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan")

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a
"Multiple Employer Plan").

  

  

(d) Each Spinco Benefit Plan in effect as of the date hereof has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. All contributions required to be
made with respect to any Spinco Benefit Plan for any period through the date
hereof have now been, or on the Distribution Date will have been, timely made,
except for outstanding contributions in the ordinary course. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of MWV, threatened claims by, on behalf of or
against any of the Spinco Benefit Plans in effect as of the date hereof or any
assets thereof, other than routine benefit claim matters, that, if adversely
determined, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco, and no material matter is
pending (other than routine qualification determination filings, copies of
which have been furnished to the Company or will be promptly furnished to the
Company when made) before the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, the
PBGC or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any Spinco Benefit
Plan.

  

  

(e) No Spinco Benefit Plan is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code. Each MWV Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the
trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code, each trust maintained under any MWV Benefit Plan intended to satisfy
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such
requirements and, in either such case, no event has occurred or condition is
known to exist that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on such tax-qualified status for any such MWV Benefit Plan or any such
trust. Each material Spinco Benefit Plan subject to the Laws of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States that is intended to qualify for
special tax treatment meets all material requirements for such treatment.

  

  

(f) No Spinco Benefit Plan provides, or on the Distribution Date will provide,
medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not
insured) for employees or former employees of Spinco or any Spinco Subsidiary
for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under
any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

  

  

(g) Except as contemplated by this Agreement and each other Transaction
Agreement, no Spinco Benefit Plan exists, or on the Distribution Date will
exist, that could result in the payment to any Spinco Employee, of any money
or other property or rights or accelerate or provide any other rights or
benefits to any such Spinco Employee as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including the
Distribution), whether or not (i) such payment, acceleration or provision
would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code) or (ii) some other subsequent action or event would be required to
cause such payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Agreements (including the Distribution) will not trigger any funding (through
a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or give rise to any
other obligation under, any Spinco Benefit Plan, trigger the forgiveness of
indebtedness owed by any Spinco Employee to the Spinco Group or result in any
violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) under, or limit Spinco's or a Spinco Subsidiaries' ability to amend,
modify or terminate, any Spinco Benefit Plan, in each case, whether or not as
a result of some other subsequent action or event.

  

  

Section 6.12 Labor Matters. None of the CandOP Entities is a party to, or bound
by, any collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with a labor union,
labor organization or works council, and no Spinco Employees are otherwise
represented by a labor union, labor organization or works council. None of the
CandOP Entities has any obligation to inform or consult with any Spinco
Employees or their representatives in respect of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements (including the Distribution). Except for such
matters which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco, (a) (i)
there are no strikes or lockouts with respect to Spinco Employees, and (ii)
there is not, and to the Knowledge of Spinco or MWV, since January 1, 2009
there has not been, any union organizing effort pending or threatened against
any of the CandOP Entities; (b) there is no unfair labor practice, charge,
complaint, labor dispute (other than routine individual grievances) or labor
arbitration proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Spinco or MWV,
threatened against any of the CandOP Entities; (c) there is no slowdown, or work
stoppage in effect or, to the Knowledge of Spinco or MWV, threatened with
respect to Spinco Employees; and (d) the CandOP Entities are in compliance with
all applicable Laws respecting (i) employment and employment practices, (ii)
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, (iii) collective
bargaining and labor relations practices, (iv) layoffs, (v) immigration, and
(vi) the payment of taxes and other withholdings. As of the date hereof, none
of the CandOP Entities has any liabilities under the WARN Act as a result of any
action taken by Spinco and that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

  

  

Section 6.13 Intellectual Property Matters. Section 6.13(a) of the MWV
Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list as of the date hereof
of (i) all material patented or registered Intellectual Property Rights (and
pending applications therefor) that are intended to be Conveyed to the Spinco
Group pursuant to the Separation Agreement, and (ii) all other patented or
registered Intellectual Property Rights (and pending applications therefor)
used or held for use in connection with the CandOP Business that is material to
the CandOP Business but, in each case, excluding any Intellectual Property
Rights to which the Spinco Group will have access as a result of any license.
The CandOP Entities own and possess, free and clear of any Liens except
Permitted Encumbrances, or will prior to the Effective Time have the right to
use pursuant to a license, all right, title and interest in and to, or have,
adequate licenses or other valid and enforceable rights to use, all
Intellectual Property Rights used or held for use in connection with the CandOP
Business as currently conducted (including in connection with services
provided by MWV, Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries to third
parties) (the "Spinco IP Rights"), except where (x) the failure to own or
possess such items would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco or (y) the Conveyance of
the Spinco Assets requires a third-party Consent or Governmental Approval
which is not obtained, in which case the provisions of Section 1.7 of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Separation Agreement will govern with respect to such Spinco Assets. To the
Knowledge of MWV, there is no assertion or claim challenging the validity,
enforceability, ownership or use of any of the Spinco IP Rights that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. The conduct of the CandOP Business as currently
conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict with any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Spinco. To the Knowledge of MWV, there are no infringements or
misappropriations of, or other conflicts with, any Spinco IP Rights that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. Assuming any requisite third-party Consents or
Governmental Approvals necessary to Convey the Spinco Assets set forth in
Section 6.13(b) of the MWV Disclosure Letter are obtained, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not impair the right, title or interest
of MWV, Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries in and to the Spinco IP
Rights, and all of the Spinco IP Rights shall be owned or available for use by
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time on terms and
conditions identical, in all material respects, to those under which MWV,
Spinco and their respective Subsidiaries owned or used the Spinco IP Rights as
of the Effective Time, except where such impairment or failure to be owned or
available for use would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. Except as set forth in
Section 6.13(b) of the MWV Disclosure Letter or pursuant to Section 5.5 of the
Separation Agreement, immediately following the Effective Time, MWV and its
Affiliates shall not own any material Spinco IP Rights. Section 6.13(c) of the
MWV Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of licenses (the "Specified Licenses")
pursuant to which any CandOP Entities makes annual royalty payments of $250,000
or more. None of the CandOP Entities is in breach of or default under the terms
of any Specified License where such breach or default has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. To the Knowledge of MWV, no other party to any
Specified License is in breach of or in default under the terms of any
Specified Licenses where such breach or default has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Spinco. Each Specified License is a valid and binding obligation of
the CandOP Entity which is a party thereto, and is in full force and effect,
except insofar as (i) such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of
equitable remedies, (ii) the failure to be a valid and binding obligation or
to be enforceable would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco (iii) such Specified
License has previously expired in accordance with its terms, or (iv) such
Specified License has been terminated in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

Section 6.14 Material Contracts.

  

  

(a) Section 6.14 of the MWV Disclosure Letter sets forth, and MWV has made
available to the Company true and complete copies of, all Spinco Material
Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Spinco Material Contracts" means any of the following
Contracts (other than this Agreement, each other Transaction Agreement and the
documents relating to the Spinco Securities and other than any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

MWV Benefit Plans), whether entered into prior to or after the date hereof,
that are intended to be Conveyed to the Spinco Group pursuant to the
Separation Agreement:

  

  

(i) any non-competition agreements or other Contracts that materially limits
or will materially limit any member of the Spinco Group from competing or
engaging in any business or geographic area;

  

  

(ii) any Contract with respect to any partnerships or joint ventures involving
the sharing of profits or losses that is material to the CandOP Business, taken
as a whole;

  

  

(iii) any indenture, credit agreement or loan agreement pursuant to which any

money in excess of $1 million, other than between or among members of the
Spinco Group;

  

  

(iv) any Contract for the sale or acquisition (including by way of merger,
purchase of equity or other business combination) of any operating business
with respect to which any member of the Spinco Group still has remaining
material obligations, including any indemnification obligations;

  

  

(v) any Contract that provides for annual payments in excess of $5 million by
or to any member of the MWV Group or the Spinco Group; and

  

  

(vi) any Contract that contains a "change of control" provision, the
termination or breach of which or the failure to obtain consent in respect of,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

  

  

(b) None of the CandOP Entities is in breach of or default under the terms of
any Spinco Material Contract where such breach or default has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. To the Knowledge of MWV, no other party to any
Spinco Material Contract is in breach of or in default under the terms of any
Spinco Material Contract where such breach or default has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. Each Spinco Material Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of the CandOP Entity which is a party thereto, and is in full force
and effect, except insofar as (i) such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing the
availability of equitable remedies, (ii) the failure to be a valid and binding
obligation or to be

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

enforceable would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco (iii) such Spinco Material
Contract has previously expired in accordance with its terms, or (iv) such
Spinco Material Contract has been terminated in the ordinary course of
business.

  

  

Section 6.15 Brokers or Finders. Other than Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Greenhill
and Co., Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by MWV, no agent,
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other similar Person is or
will be entitled, by reason of any agreement, act or statement by Spinco or
any Spinco Subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees, to any financial
advisory, broker's, finder's or similar fee or commission, to reimbursement of
expenses or to indemnification or contribution in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or each other Transaction
Agreement, in each case, for which the Company, Merger Sub, Spinco or any
Spinco Subsidiary could become liable or obligated.

  

  

Section 6.16 Board and Stockholder Approval. Each of the MWV Board and the
Spinco Board, at a meeting duly called, has by unanimous vote of all directors
present approved this Agreement and declared it advisable. As of the date
hereof, the sole stockholder of Spinco is MWV. As promptly as practicable
after execution of this Agreement, MWV will approve and adopt (the "Spinco
Stockholder Approval"), as Spinco's sole stockholder, this Agreement and other
Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
which require the consent of Spinco's stockholders under the DGCL, the NYSE
rules, Spinco's certificate of incorporation or Spinco's bylaws. The approval
of MWV's stockholders is not required to effect the transactions contemplated
by the Separation Agreement, this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements. Upon obtaining the Spinco Stockholder Approval, the approval of
Spinco's stockholders after the Distribution Date will not be required to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger,
unless this Agreement is amended on or after the Distribution Date.

  

  

Section 6.17 Sufficiency of Assets.

  

  

(a) After giving effect to the Spinco Reorganization and the other
transactions described in or contemplated by the Separation Agreement and
after giving effect to the transfers of the assets (the "Hong Kong Assets")
contemplated by Section 8.28, the Spinco Group (or in the case of the
transfers contemplated by Section 8.28, the Company or the designated Company
Subsidiary) will have, in all material respects, good and valid title, or, in
the case of the Leased Real Property, valid leasehold interests in, all of the
Spinco Assets or Hong Kong Assets, as applicable, except (i) where the failure
to have such good and valid title, or valid leasehold interest, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco, (ii) where the Conveyance of the Spinco Assets
requires a third-party Consent or Governmental Approval which is not obtained,
in which case the provisions of Section 1.7 of the Separation Agreement will
govern, and (iii) where the failure to have such good and valid title, or
valid leasehold interest, results from any of the Permitted Encumbrances, with
respect to the Owned Real Property, Spinco Leasehold Improvements and Leased
Real Property.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Spinco Assets and the Hong Kong Assets,
assuming any requisite third-party Consents or Governmental Approvals
necessary to Convey such Spinco Assets and Hong Kong Assets are obtained,
taken together with the services available from MWV under the Transition
Services Agreement, will be sufficient for the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including Spinco) to continue to operate the CandOP Business in all material
respects as it is currently conducted.

  

  

Section 6.18 Spinco Real Property.

  

  

(a) Section 6.18(a) of the MWV Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date
hereof the address and description of all Spinco Owned Real Property, the loss
of which would be material and adverse to the CandOP Business as a whole. With
respect to such Spinco Owned Real Property: (i) except for Permitted
Encumbrances, none of the CandOP Entities has leased or otherwise granted to any
Person the right to use or occupy such Spinco Owned Real Property or any
material portion thereof; and (ii) other than the right of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement, there are no outstanding options, rights of first
offer or rights of first refusal to purchase such Spinco Owned Real Property
or any material portion thereof or interest therein.

  

  

(b) Section 6.18(b) of the MWV Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date
hereof the addresses of all Spinco Leased Real Properties, the loss of which
would be material and adverse to the CandOP Business as a whole, and a true and
complete list of all Spinco Leases (including all material amendments,
extensions, renewals, guaranties and other agreements with respect thereto)
for each such Spinco Leased Real Property. MWV or Spinco has made available to
the Company a true and complete copy of each such Spinco Lease document as of
the date hereof, and in the case of any such Lease that is an oral Lease, a
written summary of the material terms of such Lease. Except as set forth on
Section 6.18(b) of the MWV Disclosure Letter, with respect to each such Spinco
Lease, since January 1, 2009, MWV's, Spinco's or their respective
Subsidiaries' possession and quiet enjoyment of the Spinco Leased Real
Property under such Spinco Lease has not been disturbed in any material
respect that is ongoing or is reasonable likely to recur, and, to MWV's
Knowledge, there are no material disputes with respect to such Spinco Lease.
With respect to each such Spinco Lease, (i) none of the members of the MWV
Group or the Spinco Group has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any

Letter; (ii) none of the members of the MWV Group or Spinco Group has
collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest in such Spinco
Lease or any material interest therein; and (iii) there are no Liens on the
estate or interest created by such Spinco Lease other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

  

  

Section 6.19 Spinco Operations. As of the date hereof, Spinco is a direct,
wholly owned Subsidiary of MWV that, subject to the terms of the Separation
Agreement, following the Spinco Reorganization will own, directly or
indirectly, the Spinco Assets, and will have assumed, directly or indirectly,
the Spinco Liabilities, all as provided in the Separation Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Section 6.20 Company Common Stock. Neither MWV nor Spinco owns (directly or
indirectly, beneficially or of record) nor is a party to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company (other
than as contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

Section 6.21 Products Liability. To the Knowledge of MWV, there are no
actions, suits, arbitrations or proceedings relating to products liability
pending or threatened against or affecting the CandOP Entities or any of their
respective properties to the extent such properties are intended to be
Conveyed to the Spinco Group pursuant to the Separation Agreement or otherwise
affecting the CandOP Business at Law or in equity, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. None of the CandOP Entities currently manufactures,
nor have any of them manufactured since January 1, 2008, any products
containing asbestos, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

  

  

Section 6.22 Human Health and Safety. The CandOP Entities are, and since January
1, 2010, have been, in compliance with all applicable Laws relating to the
protection of human health and safety (including workplace health and safety),

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

  

  

Section 6.23 Contemplated MWV Financing. Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a
true and fully executed copy of the MWV Commitment Letter, pursuant to which
the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein to MWV (the "MWV
Financing"). The MWV Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, and as of the date of this Agreement the
commitments contained in the MWV Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or
Contracts to which MWV or any of its Subsidiaries is a party related to the
funding of MWV Financing that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the availability of the MWV Financing. As of the date hereof, the MWV
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and
binding enforceable obligation of MWV, and, to the Knowledge of MWV, each of
the parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the MWV Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the MWV Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof,
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in ARTICLE VII, no event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of MWV or, to the Knowledge of MWV,
any other party thereto under the MWV Commitment Letter.

  

  

Section 6.24 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties of MWV and Spinco expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, neither MWV nor Spinco nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries nor any other Person acting on behalf of MWV or Spinco
or any of their respective Subsidiaries makes any representation or warranty,
express or implied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and Merger Sub each acknowledge that no representations or warranties
are made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates or budgets with
respect to the CandOP

Business that may have been made available to the Company, Merger Sub or any
of their Representatives.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

  

  

Except as otherwise disclosed or identified in (i) the Company SEC Documents
filed on or prior to the date hereof (excluding any risk factor disclosure and
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer
included in such Company SEC Documents that are predictive, forward-looking or
primarily cautionary in nature) or (ii) subject to Section 11.4(b), the
corresponding section of the Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to MWV
and Spinco immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Letter"), the Company and Merger Sub, jointly and severally,
represent and warrant to MWV and Spinco as follows:

  

  

Section 7.1 Organization; Qualification.

  

  

(a) The Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted, except in the case of the Company's Significant
Subsidiaries, for such failure to be so duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and
each of its Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified and licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership
or leasing of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The copies of the Company Charter, Company Bylaws and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or analogous governing documents) of any Company
Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary of the Company previously made
available to MWV and Spinco are complete and correct copies of such documents
as in full force and effect on the date hereof.

  

  

(b) Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of Delaware. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Merger Sub which were previously furnished or made available to MWV
are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(c) Section 7.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the
Significant Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation or organization.

  

  

Section 7.2 Capital Stock and Other Matters.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares

outstanding, (ii) 8,122,064 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plans; (iii) 183,703 shares of Company
Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury or by its Subsidiaries;
and (iv) no shares of preferred stock of the Company were issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

  

  

(b) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries having the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which

Section 7.4 Company Reports and Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed all reports and other documents with the SEC
required to be filed or furnished by the Company since January 1, 2009 (such
documents, together with any current reports filed during such period by the
Company with the SEC on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, the "Company SEC
Documents"). As of their respective dates (and if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing),
the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects, and each other
form, report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement
filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time (the "Additional Company SEC Documents") will
comply in all material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and, subject to the last sentence of
Section 7.8, none of such Company SEC Documents when filed contained, or will
contain, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the Company
SEC Documents and the Additional Company SEC Documents fairly present in all
material respects, or will fairly present in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in cash
flows, changes in stockholders' equity or other information included therein
for the periods or as of the respective dates then ended, in each case except
as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited interim
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments. Each of the financial
statements (including the related notes) of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents and such other financial statements have been or will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, except as otherwise
noted therein.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, the Company has timely filed all
reports, registration statements and other filings required to be filed with
the SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Since the Interim Balance
Sheet Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not incurred any
liabilities or obligations that are of a nature that would be required to be
disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP as
applied in preparing the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, other than liabilities or
obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

  

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company required pursuant to Sections
302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act").

  

  

Section 7.5 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has conducted its business in the
ordinary course, consistent with past practice, and there has not been any
event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. From the Interim Balance
Sheet Date to the date hereof, none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action, which action
or failure, as the case may be, would constitute a material breach of Section
8.1 if taken without the consent of MWV and Spinco after the date hereof.
Merger Sub has not conducted any activities other than in connection with the
organization of Merger Sub, the negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 7.6 Investigations; Litigation.

  

  

(a) Other than in connection with the Required Approvals, there is no
investigation or review pending (or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened) by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case which would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) There are no actions, suits, arbitrations or proceedings pending (or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened) against or affecting the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties at Law
or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of or
before any Governmental Authority, in each case which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.6, no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this Section 7.6 in
respect of products liability claims, which is the subject of the
representations and warranties made in Section 7.21.

  

  

Section 7.7 Compliance with Laws; Permits.

  

  

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2010
have been, in compliance with all, and have received no notice of any
violation (as yet unremedied) of any, Laws, applicable to the Company, such
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except
where such non-compliance or violation has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.7,
no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this Section 7.7
in respect of environmental, tax, employee benefits or labor Laws matters,
which are the subject of the representations and warranties made in Section
7.9, Section 7.10, Section 7.11 and Section 7.12, respectively.

  

  

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure
to have any of the Company Permits has not had, or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where
the failure to be in full force and effect has not had, or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

  

Section 7.8 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement. None of the
information regarding the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided by the Company
specifically for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Spinco Registration
Statement will, in the case of the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of the mailing of the
definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto,
and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or, in the case of the
Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration Statement, at the time such
registration statement becomes effective, at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (in the case of the Registration Statement and the Spinco
Registration Statement), at the Distribution Date and at the Effective Time,
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to
information provided by MWV or Spinco specifically for inclusion in, or
incorporation by reference into, the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

assessments, environmental compliance audits, and other documents produced in
the last five (5) years relating to environmental matters, and relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their current or former
properties or facilities to the extent such documents are in the possession,
custody or control of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
including such documents relating to the environmental conditions on, under or

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

properties or assets currently or formerly owned, leased, operated or used by
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor in interest
thereto.

  

  

This Section 7.9 contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company or Merger Sub with respect to environmental matters,
including matters relating to Environmental Laws and Hazardous Materials.

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Section 7.11 Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Section 7.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each material
Company Benefit Plan (except Company Benefit Plans not in the United States
and Canada). For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Benefit Plan" means each
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), and all other
employee benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, stock option (or
other equity-based), severance, employment, change in control, welfare
(including post-retirement medical and life insurance) and fringe benefit
plans, programs, agreements and arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA
and whether written or oral, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or
required to be contributed to by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party or in which any Person who is currently, has been or, prior to the
Effective Time, is expected to become an employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (a "Company Employee") is a participant, in each case
that relate to the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate
of any of them has any commitment or formal plan, whether legally binding or
not, to create any additional employee benefit plan or modify or change any
existing Company Benefit Plan that would affect any Company Employee. The
Company has heretofore delivered or made available to MWV and Spinco true and
complete copies of each Company Benefit Plan and any amendments thereto (if
the plan is not a written plan, a description thereof), any related trust or
other funding vehicle, any reports or summaries required under ERISA or the
Code for the most recent reporting period and the most recent determination
letter received from the IRS (if any) with respect to each such plan intended
to qualify under Section 401 of the Code.

  

  

(b) No material liability under Title IV (including Sections 4069 and 4212(c)
of ERISA) or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected
to result in the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate of any of them incurring any such liability, other than liability
for premiums due the PBGC (which premiums have been paid when due). With
respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, (i)
no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which
the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in the occurrence of any such reportable event; and (ii) the PBGC has
not instituted proceedings to terminate any Company Benefit Plan and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Company Benefit Plan. The present value of accrued
benefits under each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA,
determined based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in
the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect
to such plan, did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then
current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(c) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan, (ii) none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate of any of them has, at any time during the last six years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan and (iii) none of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them has made or suffered a
"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are
respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, which has not been
satisfied in full.

  

  

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including
ERISA and the Code. All contributions required to be made with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan have been timely made, except for outstanding
contributions in the ordinary course. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any of
the Company Benefit Plans or any assets thereof, other than routine benefit
claim matters, that, if adversely determined would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and no material matter is pending (other than routine qualification
determination filings, copies of which have been furnished to MWV and Spinco
or will be promptly furnished to MWV and Spinco when made) with respect to any
of the Company Benefit Plans before the IRS, the United States Department of
Labor, the PBGC or any other Governmental Authority.

  

  

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts maintained
thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, each
trust maintained under any Company Benefit Plan intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such requirements
and, in either such case, no event has occurred or condition is known to exist
that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on such
tax-qualified status for any such Company Benefit Plan or any such trust. Each
material Company Benefit Plan subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside
of the United States that is intended to qualify for special tax treatment
meets all material requirements for such treatment.

  

  

(f) No Company Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death
or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for periods extending beyond their
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii)
benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or
his beneficiary). The Company has the right, and will have the right after the
Effective Time to terminate any Company Benefit Plan or to amend any such
Company Benefit Plan to reduce future benefits (including any Company Benefit
Plan that provides post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits),
without incurring or otherwise being responsible for any material liability
with respect thereto.

  

  

(g) No Company Benefit Plan in any jurisdiction, and no contractual
arrangements between the Company and any third party, exists that could result
in the payment

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

to any current, former or future director, officer, stockholder or employee of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or of any entity the assets or
capital stock of which have been acquired by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, of any money or other property or rights or accelerate or provide
any other rights or benefits to any such individual as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
whether or not (a) such payment, acceleration or provision would constitute a
"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) or (b)
some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such payment,
acceleration or provision to be triggered. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements will not trigger any
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or
give rise to any other obligation under, any Company Benefit Plan in any
jurisdiction, trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by any current,
former or future director, officer, stockholder or employee of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
result in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or limit the Company's or any Company
Subsidiary's ability to amend, modify or terminate, any Company Benefit Plan
in any jurisdiction, in each case, whether or not as a result of some other
subsequent action or event.

  

  

Section 7.12 Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries that is organized under the laws of the United States or Canada
is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other
agreement with a labor union, labor organization or works council, and no
Company Employees whose employment is based in the United States or Canada are
otherwise represented by a labor union, labor organization or works council.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to inform or
consult with any Company Employees or their representatives in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Except for such
matters which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
(a) (i) there are no strikes or lockouts with respect to Company Employees,
and (ii) there is not, and to the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1,
2009 there has not been, any union organizing effort pending or threatened
against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; (b) there is no unfair
labor practice, charges or complaint, labor dispute (other than routine
individual grievances) or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries; (c) there is no slowdown, or work stoppage in effect or, to the
Knowledge of Company, threatened with respect to Company Employees; and (d)
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Laws respecting (i) employment and employment practices, (ii) terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, (iii) collective bargaining and
labor relations practices, (iv) layoffs, (v) immigration, and (vi) the payment
of taxes and other withholdings. As of the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries have any liabilities under the WARN Act as
a result of any action taken by the Company and that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

  

  

Section 7.13 Intellectual Property Matters. Section 7.13(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list as of the date hereof
of (i) all material patented or registered Intellectual Property Rights (and
pending applications therefor) owned by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and (ii) all other patented or registered

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Intellectual Property Rights (and pending applications therefor) used or held
for use by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that are material to
the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
but, in each case, excluding any Intellectual Property Rights to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries will have access as a result of any
license. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own and possess free and
clear of any Liens except Permitted Encumbrances, or will prior to the
Effective Time have the right to use pursuant to a license, all right, title
and interest in and to, or have adequate licenses or other valid and
enforceable rights to use, all Intellectual Property Rights used or held for
use in connection with the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole as currently conducted and as proposed to be
conducted immediately after the Effective Time (including in connection with
services provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to third
parties) (the "Company IP Rights"), except where the failure to own or possess
such items would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no assertion or claim challenging the validity,
enforceability, ownership or use of any of the Company IP Rights that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The conduct of the business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole as currently conducted and as
proposed to be conducted immediately after the Effective Time does not
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict in any way with any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no infringements or
misappropriations of, or other conflicts with, any Company IP Rights that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not impair the right, title or interest of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in and to the Company IP Rights, and all of the Company IP
Rights shall be owned or available for use by the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time on terms and conditions identical in all
material respects to those under which the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries owned or used the Company IP Rights as of the Effective Time,
except where such impairment or failure to be owned or available for use would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Section 7.13(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of licenses (the "Company Specified
Licenses") pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary makes
annual royalty payments of $250,000 or more. None of the Company or Company
Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under the terms of any Company
Specified License where such breach or default has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Company
Specified License is in breach of or in default under the terms of any Company
Specified License where such breach or default has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Each Company Specified License is a valid and binding
obligation of the Company or Company Subsidiary which is a party thereto, and
is in full force and effect, except insofar as (i) such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies, (ii) the failure to be a valid and
binding obligation or to be enforceable would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Effect on the Company (iii) the Company Specified License has previously
expired in accordance with its terms, or (iv) the Company Specified License
has been terminated in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

Section 7.14 Material Contracts.

  

  

(a) The Company has made available to MWV true and complete copies of all
Company Material Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement that
relate to the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the
United States and Canada. Section 7.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of all such Company Material Contracts. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material Contracts" means any of
the following Contracts (other than this Agreement, each other Transaction
Agreement and the documents relating to the Company Financing and other than
any Company Benefit Plan), whether entered into prior to or after the date
hereof, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party:

  

  

(i) any non-competition agreements or other Contracts that materially limits
or will materially limit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from competing
or engaging in any business or geographic area;

  

  

(ii) any Contract with respect to any partnerships or joint ventures involving
the sharing of profits or losses that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

  

  

(iii) any indenture, credit agreement or loan agreement pursuant to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or will incur any indebtedness for
borrowed money in excess of $1 million, other than between or among any of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries;

  

  

(iv) any Contract for the sale or acquisition (including by way of merger,
purchase of equity or other business combination) of any operating business
with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries still has
remaining material obligations, including any indemnification obligations;

  

  

(v) any Contract that provides for annual payments in excess of $5 million by
or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

  

  

(vi) any Contract that contains a "change of control" provision, the
termination or breach of which or the failure to obtain the consent in respect
of, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach of or default
under the terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach or default
has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no other party to any Company Material Contract is in breach of or in
default under the terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach or
default has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each Company Material
Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary which is a party thereto and is in full force and effect, except
insofar as (i) such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies, (ii) the failure to be a valid and binding obligation or to be
enforceable would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (iii) the Company
Material Contract has previously expired in accordance with its terms, or (iv)
the Company Material Contract has been terminated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.

hereof the address and description of all Company Owned Real Property, the
loss of which would be material and adverse to the business of the Company as
a whole. With respect to such Company Owned Real Property: (i) except for
Permitted Encumbrances, the Company or Company Subsidiaries have not leased or
otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy such Company Owned
Real Property or any material portion thereof; and (ii) other than the right
of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, there are no outstanding options,
rights of first offer or rights of first refusal to purchase such Company
Owned Real Property or any material portion thereof or interest therein.

  

  

(b) Section 7.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date

would be material and adverse to the business of the Company as a whole, and a
true and complete list of all Company Leases for such properties (including
all material amendments, extensions, renewals, guaranties and other agreements
with respect thereto) for each such Company Leased Real Property. The Company
has made available to MWV a true and complete copy of each such Company Lease
document as of the date hereof, and in the case of any such Lease that is an
oral Lease, a written summary of the material terms of such Lease. Except as
set forth on Section 7.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, with respect to
each such Lease, since January 1, 2009, the Company's or Company Subsidiaries'
possession and quiet enjoyment of the Company Leased Property under such
Company Lease has not been disturbed in any material respect that is ongoing
or is reasonably likely to recur, and, to the Company's Knowledge, there are
no material disputes with respect to such Company Lease. With respect to each
such Lease: (i) none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has subleased,
licensed or otherwise granted any Person the right to use or occupy such
Company Leased Real Property or any material portion thereof; (ii) none of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries has collaterally

of the Spinco Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Company and (ii) and William Blair and Company,
L.L.C., to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the consideration to be

in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
each other Transaction Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.18 Certain Board Findings. The Company Board, at a meeting duly

Company present or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (sometimes referred to herein as the "Company Stockholder Approval").

indirectly, beneficially or of record) nor is it a party to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of Spinco (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement) or MWV. Assuming the accuracy of Section
6.20, the limitations on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL are inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the
Company Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or

Statement or the Spinco Registration Statement containing an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitting to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or that otherwise
should be described in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Spinco Registration
Statement, MWV, Spinco and the Company shall promptly notify each other of the
occurrence of such event and then promptly prepare, file and clear with the
SEC and mail, or cause to be mailed, to the Company's stockholders each such
amendment or supplement.

  

  

(h) MWV and Spinco agree to promptly provide the Company with the information
concerning MWV and Spinco and their respective Affiliates required to be

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 25Business Days after the
date hereof, (ii) appropriate filings, if any are required, with foreign
regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable competition, merger
control,

antitrust, investment or similar applicable Laws ("Foreign Competition Laws")
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and (iii) all other necessary filings with other Governmental
Authorities relating to the Merger, and, in each case, to supply as promptly
as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to such applicable Laws or by such authorities and to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of the Required
Approvals under such other applicable Laws or from such authorities as soon as
practicable. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
the Company and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and MWV and Spinco, on the other
hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in this Section 8.7(a)
to obtain all Required Approvals, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform
the other party of (and, if in writing, share a copy) any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division

permit the other party to review in advance any communication to be given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or material
telephone call with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Authority

(b) Without limiting this Section 8.7, each of the parties agrees to take, or
to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including proposing,
negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such
assets or businesses of Spinco (or the Spinco Subsidiaries) or the Company (or
the Company Subsidiaries), as applicable, or otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit Spinco's or the Spinco Subsidiaries' or the Company's
or the Company Subsidiaries', as applicable, freedom of action with respect
to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets
of Spinco (or the Spinco Subsidiaries) or the Company (or the Company
Subsidiaries), in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing the Closing; provided that the effectiveness of any
such sale, divestiture, license or disposition or action or commitment shall
be contingent on consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the obligations of this Section 8.7(b) shall not apply to each of the parties
if compliance with this Section 8.7(b) would result in, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company after giving
effect to the Merger.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, MWV
and Spinco shall submit to the IRS a request (the "Ruling Request") for (A)
the IRS D Reorganization Ruling and the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling and (B) any
other ruling in connection with the Spinco Reorganization, the Distribution or

submitted to the IRS relating thereto (each, an "IRS Submission") shall be
prepared by MWV. MWV shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on each material IRS Submission prior to the filing of
such IRS Submission with the IRS and MWV shall, in good faith, consider any
comments provided by the Company on each such material IRS Submission;
provided that MWV may redact from any IRS Submission any information
("Redactable Information") that (x) MWV, in its good faith judgment, considers
to be confidential and not germane to the Company's or Spinco's obligations
under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements, and (y) is
not a part of any other publicly available information, including any non-
confidential filing. No IRS Submission shall be filed with the IRS unless,
prior to such filing, the Company shall have agreed (which agreement will not
be withheld unreasonably, conditioned or delayed) as to the contents of such
IRS Submission, to the extent that such contents include statements or
representations relating to facts that are or will be under the control of the
Company or any of its Affiliates (including Spinco or the Spinco Subsidiaries

(ii) MWV shall provide the Company with copies of each IRS Submission as filed
with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof; provided that MWV may

reasonable best efforts to notify the Company and the Company's
representatives reasonably in advance of any substantive communications with
the IRS regarding any material issue arising with respect to the Ruling
Request, including meetings or conferences with IRS personnel, whether
telephonically, in person or otherwise and to give the Company (or the
Company's representatives) a reasonable opportunity to participate. Solely for
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.8(a)(ii) shall provide
grounds for Spinco or the Company to alter any obligation or limitation
imposed upon it under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Distribution Tax Opinion. Each of MWV, Spinco and the Company agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Distribution Tax Opinion. The
Distribution Tax Opinion shall be based upon the IRS D Reorganization Ruling
and the IRS Debt Exchange Ruling and customary representations and covenants,
including those contained in certificates of MWV, Spinco, the Company and
others, reasonably satisfactory in form and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

substance to MWV Tax Counsel (such representations and covenants, the
"Distribution Tax Representations"). Each of MWV, Spinco and the Company shall
deliver to MWV Tax Counsel for purposes of the Distribution Tax Opinion
customary Distribution Tax Representations, reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to MWV Tax Counsel.

  

  

(c) Merger Tax Opinions. MWV and Spinco, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall cooperate with each other in obtaining, and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, a written opinion of MWV
Tax Counsel, in the case of MWV and Spinco, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP, in the case of the Company ("Company Tax Counsel"), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to MWV and the Company, respectively (each
such opinion, a "Merger Tax Opinion"), dated as of the Effective Time, to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the Company, MWV and Spinco
shall deliver to Company Tax Counsel and MWV Tax Counsel for purposes of the
Merger Tax Opinions customary representations and covenants, including those
contained in certificates of the Company, MWV, Spinco and others, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Company Tax Counsel and MWV Tax Counsel.

the Registration Statement and the Spinco Registration Statement shall become

respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other authorized
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout
the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date,
to its and its Subsidiaries' officers, employees, accountants, consultants,
representatives, plants, properties, Contracts, commitments, books, records
(including Tax Returns) and any report, schedule or other document filed or
received by it pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities
laws, and shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause its respective
representatives to furnish promptly to the other such additional financial and
operating data and other information, including environmental information, as
to its and its Subsidiaries' respective businesses and properties as the
others or their respective duly authorized representatives, as the case may
be, may reasonably request; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall
require any Person to permit any inspection or disclose any information to
another Person that would cause a violation of any Contract, would cause a
risk of a loss of privilege to the first Person, that is competitively
sensitive information or to permit another Person to perform any onsite
procedure with respect to any of the first Person's or its Subsidiaries'
properties (provided that the Person that would otherwise be required to
disclose information to the other shall take any and all reasonable action
necessary to permit such disclosure without such loss of privilege or
violation of agreement or Law). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties shall be obligated to grant any
access or make any disclosure in violation of applicable Laws or regulations
or if it would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such party's
business or grant any access to, or make any disclosure of, any customer
Contracts. The parties hereby agree that the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to all information and material furnished by any party
or its representatives thereunder and hereunder. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.11 Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries, the "Representatives") not to, (i) initiate or solicit or
knowingly facilitate or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries with
respect to, or the making of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) except as
permitted below in Section 8.11(b), engage in negotiations or discussions
with, furnish access to its properties, books and records or provide any
information or data to any Person relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) except as permitted below in Section 8.11(d), approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section
8.11(b)), (v) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
"standstill" or similar obligation of any Person other than MWV, (vi) take any
action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

statute or regulation (including any transaction under, or a third party
becoming an "interested shareholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL)
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Company Acquisition
Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly
take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore
granted, to any Person other than MWV or any of MWV's Affiliates, under any
such provisions), (vii) take any action to make the consummation of any
Company Acquisition Proposal exempt under the terms of the Rights Agreement,
or (viii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company
shall immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Person that has made or indicated an intention to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal (except MWV, Spinco and their respective
Representatives).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event that the
Company receives a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of Section 8.11(a), the Company and the Company Board may
participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof,
making any counterproposal) with, or furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, any information to (provided that all such
information has previously been provided or made available to MWV or is
provided or made available to MWV substantially concurrently with the time it
is so furnished), any Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its counsel and financial
advisor, that such Person is reasonably likely to submit to the Company a
Company Acquisition Proposal that is a Company Superior Proposal. In addition,
nothing herein shall restrict the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations with regard to any Company Acquisition Proposal under applicable
Law; provided, however, that any action that would constitute a Change in
Recommendation may only be made in compliance with Section 8.11(d). For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written offer made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, by
merger, consolidation or other business combination or other similar
acquisition transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, at least a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, with respect to which the Company Board (after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors) has determined in its good
faith judgment that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such
written offer (x) would be more favorable to the Company's stockholders than
the Merger, after taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal (including the financial aspects of such proposal, the form of
consideration, the likelihood, ability to finance, conditionality and timing
of consummation of such proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and any other aspects of the transaction described in such
proposal, including the identity of the Person or "group" (as defined in or
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such proposal) and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by MWV to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise), (y)
would not be subject to any due diligence condition and (z) would be
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal; and an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means any customary
confidentiality agreement that contains

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

provisions that are no less restrictive to such Person, and no less favorable
to the Company, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
after receipt) notify MWV of the receipt by the Company of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of the Person(s)
making such Company Acquisition Proposal and copies of any written materials
evidencing such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company will keep MWV
reasonably informed of the status and material terms and conditions of any
such Company Acquisition Proposal. Without limitation to the foregoing, the
Company will provide to MWV on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) of any material modifications to the terms of
any Company Acquisition Proposal (including promptly furnishing copies of any
written materials evidencing such material modifications) and will promptly
notify MWV of any determination by the Company Board that a Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal. The Company
shall not, and shall cause the Company's Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, in each
case, that prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations under
this Section 8.11.

  

  

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.11(d), the Company Board
shall not (i) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (ii) withhold, withdraw, amend, change, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to MWV, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend, change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to MWV, the Company
Recommendation or (iii) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend to the
stockholders of the Company any Company Acquisition Proposal, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend to the stockholders of the Company any
Company Acquisition Proposal ((i) and (ii) above being referred to as a
"Change in Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and only if the
Company has not violated the terms of Section 8.11(a) in any material respect,
the Company Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, subject to Section 8.11(e), effect a Change in Recommendation, (A)
if an event, fact, development or occurrence that affects the business,
assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company that
is unknown to the Company Board as of immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement becomes known to the Company Board (an "Intervening Event") or
(B) if the Company Board has received a bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal that it determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, and in each case of (A) or (B), the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would present a
reasonable likelihood of constituting a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may not make a Change in Recommendation unless (i) it notifies MWV in
writing of its intention to take such action at least four (4) Business Days
prior to taking

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

such action, (x) identifying the Person(s) making such Company Superior
Proposal and providing copies of any written materials evidencing such Company
Superior Proposal or (y) describing in reasonable detail the Intervening
Event, as the case may be, (ii) if requested by MWV, the Company and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with MWV during such
notice period to enable MWV to propose changes to the terms of this Agreement
intended to cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, or, in the case of a proposed Change in
Recommendation as a result of an Intervening Event, that obviate the need for
such a Change in Recommendation, (iii) the Company Board shall have considered
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by MWV and
determined that the Company Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect, or that
such changes would not obviate the need for a Change in Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event, and (iv) in the event of any change to any
of the financial terms (including the form or amount of consideration) or any
material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to MWV an additional notice and copies of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement and other material documents; provided that the
notice period and the period during which the Company and its Representatives
are required to negotiate in good faith with MWV regarding any changes to any
of the financial terms or any material terms of such Company Superior Proposal
pursuant to this Section 8.11(e) shall expire three (3) Business Days after
the Company provides written notice of such changes to MWV.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 8.11 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with applicable Law, it being understood, however, that
(x) nothing in this Section 8.11(f) shall be deemed to permit the Company
Board to make a Change in Recommendation except to the extent permitted by
Section 8.11(d) and (y) any disclosure under this Section 8.11(f) (other than
issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed a Change in Recommendation to the extent the Company Board does not
publicly state that it has not changed its recommendation with respect to the
Merger within one (1) Business Day following any request by MWV.

  

  

Section 8.12 Spinco Financing.

  

  

(a) The Company shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Spinco Commitment
Letter and the Related Letters without the prior written consent of MWV (and,
to the extent Section 8.3 is applicable, such consent is subject to MWV's
obligations in Section 8.3), if such amendments, modifications or waivers
would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Spinco
Financing below the Below Basis Amount, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Spinco Financing that would reasonably be
expected to (A) expand in any material respect the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding at Closing, (B) prevent

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, or (C) materially adversely
impact the ability of the Company to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Spinco Commitment Letter (provided that for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company may replace or amend the Spinco Commitment Letter and the
Related Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities, if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or impair the availability of the financing under the
Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related Letters or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements). The Company and Merger Sub shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Spinco Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by
the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related Letters, including using
reasonable best efforts to (1) maintain in effect the Spinco Commitment Letter
and the Related Letters, (2) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account
the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions and covenants
applicable to the Company in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related
Letters and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (3) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto (the "Debt Financing Agreements")
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Spinco Commitment Letter and
the Related Letters (or terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
no less favorable to the Company and Spinco (in the reasonable discretion of
the Company) than the terms and conditions in the Spinco Commitment Letter and
the Related Letters), (4) in the event that all conditions in the Spinco
Commitment Letter and the Related Letters have been satisfied, consummate the
Spinco Financing at or prior to Closing, (5) enforce its rights under the
Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related Letters and (6) in the event that all
conditions in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related Letters have been
satisfied, cause the lenders providing the Spinco Financing to fund the Spinco
Financing. The Company shall (x) furnish to MWV complete, correct and executed
copies of the Debt Financing Agreements, (y) give MWV prompt notice of any
material breach by any party of any of the Spinco Commitment Letter or any of
the Related Letters or the Debt Financing Agreements of which the Company
becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) upon MWV's request, otherwise
keep MWV reasonably informed of the status of the Company's efforts to arrange
the Spinco Financing (or any replacement thereof). If any portion of the
Spinco Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related Letters (including the flex
provisions) or from sources contemplated in the Spinco Commitment Letter and
the Related Letters, the Company and Spinco shall use their reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from alternative debt
sources for the same purposes as the purposes of the Spinco Financing in an
amount not less than the Below Basis Amount upon terms and conditions not less
favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company and Spinco (in the discretion of
the Company) than those in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Related
Letters as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
including using reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto.

  

  

(b) MWV shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the MWV Commitment Letter without the
prior written consent of the Company (and, to the extent Section 8.3 is
applicable, such consent is subject to the Company's obligations in Section
8.3), if such amendments,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

modifications or waivers would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the MWV Financing below the Above Basis Amount, (ii)
impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the MWV Financing that
would reasonably be expected to (A) expand in any material respect the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding at Closing, (B) prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, (C) materially adversely
impact the ability of MWV to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the MWV Commitment Letter or (D) affect in any manner the terms of the Spinco
Distribution Debt. MWV, Spinco and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the MWV Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the MWV Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (1) maintain in effect the MWV Commitment Letter, (2) satisfy on a
timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period)
all conditions and covenants applicable to MWV, Spinco and the Company in the
MWV Commitment Letter and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder,
(3) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto (the "MWV Debt
Financing Agreements") on the terms and conditions contemplated by the MWV
Commitment Letter (or terms and conditions no less favorable to MWV, Spinco
and the Company (in the reasonable discretion of MWV and the Company,
respectively) than the terms and conditions in the MWV Commitment Letter), (4)
in the case of MWV, enforce its rights under the Spinco Commitment Letters,
and (5) in the event that all conditions in the MWV Commitment Letter and the
definitive documentation with respect thereto have been satisfied, cause the
lenders providing the MWV Financing to fund the MWV Debt and, on the Closing
Date, accept Spinco Distribution Debt in full satisfaction thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, i) MWV shall have the sole responsibility and
sole discretion with respect to the negotiation of the definitive
documentation with respect to the MWV Debt in accordance with the MWV
Commitment Letter and ii) the Company shall have the sole responsibility and
sole discretion with respect to the negotiation of the definitive
documentation with respect to the Spinco Distribution Debt in accordance with
the MWV Commitment Letter (it being understood that the Spinco Distribution
Debt may have an interest rate up to the Total Cap if required by the lenders
under the MWV Commitment Letter). The Company and MWV shall (x) furnish to the
other complete, correct and executed copies of the applicable MWV Debt
Financing Agreements negotiated by them, (y) give the other prompt notice of
any material breach by any party of the MWV Commitment Letter or any of the
MWV Debt Financing Agreements of which either shall become aware or any
termination thereof and (z) upon request, otherwise keep the other reasonably
informed of the status of their respective efforts to arrange the MWV
Financing (or any replacement thereof), including both the MWV Debt and the
Spinco Distribution Debt. If any portion of the MWV Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the MWV Commitment
Letter (including the flex provisions) or from sources contemplated in the MWV
Commitment Letter, the Company and MWV shall use their reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources
for the same purposes as the purposes of the MWV Financing in an amount not
less than the Above Basis Amount upon terms and conditions not less favorable,
taken as a whole, to the Company and MWV (each in their respective discretion)
than those in the MWV Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, including using reasonable best efforts to enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the first
period of twenty (20) consecutive Business Days throughout which (I) the
Company shall have received from Spinco all of the Required Financial
Information and during which period such information shall remain compliant in
all material respects at all times with the applicable provisions of
Regulation S-X and S-K under the Securities Act and (II) the conditions set
forth in Section 9.1 shall be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing Date) and nothing
has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 9.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature can
only be satisfied at the Closing Date and other than the condition in Section
9.2(f)) to fail to be satisfied, assuming that the Closing Date were to be
scheduled for any time during such twenty (20) consecutive Business Day
period; provided that such period will not include any date from and including
November 21, 2011 through and including November 28, 2011 and from and
including December 19, 2011 through and including January 3, 2012; provided,
further, that the Marketing Period will not be deemed to have commenced if
prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, (x) Spinco's auditors shall
have withdrawn their audit opinion contained in the Required Financial
Information in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence
unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect
thereto by Spinco's auditors or another independent public accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to the Company, (y) the financial statements included in
the Required Financial Information that is available to the Company on the
first day of the Marketing Period would not be sufficiently current on any day
during such period to satisfy the requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X
to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the receipt by the
Company of updated Required Financial Information that would be required under
Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such
financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of
such new twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period or (z) MWV or Spinco
issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any historical
financial statements of Spinco or that any such restatement is under
consideration or may be a possibility in which case the Marketing Period shall
not be deemed to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed
and the relevant SEC Report or SEC Reports have been amended or MWV has
announced that it has concluded that no restatement shall be required in
accordance with GAAP; provided, further, that the Marketing Period shall end
on any earlier date that is the date on which the Spinco Financing is funded.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing, each of MWV and Spinco shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
respective Representatives to, provide to the Company, at the Company's sole
expense, all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by the Company that
is necessary in connection with the Spinco Financing and the Spinco
Distribution Debt, including (i) furnishing the Company and its financing
sources the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Spinco and its
Subsidiaries and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows as of the end of any quarterly period that ends between
the execution of this Agreement and the forty-fifth day (45th) day prior to
the Closing Date, and all Spinco information, financial statements and
financial data of a type and form customarily included in private placements
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act for financings similar to the
Spinco Distribution Debt and subject

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

to exceptions customary for such financings and including audited financial
statements for each of the three most recent fiscal years ending more than
ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date (the information required to be
delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as, the "Required
Financial Information"), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings
(including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead
arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Spinco
Financing and the Spinco Distribution Debt and senior management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of Spinco),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Spinco Financing and the
Spinco Distribution Debt, (iii) assisting with the preparation of customary
materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda,
offering documents, private placement memoranda and similar documents required
in connection with the Spinco Financing and the Spinco Distribution Debt
(including requesting any consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to the Spinco Distribution Debt and the delivery of one
or more customary representation letters), (iv) causing the taking of
corporate actions by Spinco and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to
permit the completion of the Spinco Financing and the issuance of the Spinco
Distribution Debt to MWV to be applied in satisfaction of the MWV Debt, (v)
facilitating the execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents
related to the Spinco Financing and the Spinco Distribution Debt on the terms
contemplated by the Spinco Commitment Letter, the Related Letters and the MWV
Commitment Letter, (vi) cooperating with consultants or others engaged to
undertake field examinations and appraisals, including furnishing information
to such persons in respect of accounts receivable, inventory and other
applicable assets, (vii) providing to the financing sources all documentation
and other information reasonably requested by such sources that such sources
reasonably determine is required by regulatory authorities with respect to
Spinco under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, and (viii) cooperating in
procuring, prior to the date that is twenty (20) consecutive calendar days
prior to the Closing Date, corporate and facilities ratings for the Spinco
Financing and the Spinco Distribution Debt; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of Spinco or its Subsidiaries.
None of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action
that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost or
expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Spinco Financing or any of the foregoing,
prior to the Effective Time, unless such action is contingent upon the
Closing. If the Closing does not occur, the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless MWV, Spinco, their respective Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any action, claim, arbitration, litigation
or suit brought by a third party related to the arrangement of the Spinco
Financing, the MWV Debt and the Spinco Distribution Debt (including any action
taken in accordance with this Section 8.12(d)) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than historical information relating to Spinco or
its Subsidiaries or other information furnished by or on behalf of Spinco or
its Subsidiaries). Spinco hereby consents to the reasonable use of Spinco's
and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Spinco Financing and the
Spinco Distribution Debt, provided that such logos are used in a manner that
is

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

not intended to harm or disparage Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) The Company shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket, third party fees
and expenses related to the Spinco Financing and the MWV Financing (including
all fees under the Related Letters and the Fee Letter referred to in the MWV
Commitment Letter and all indemnity claims under any of them), and all
underwriting, sale, distribution, placement or other fees, and indemnity
claims, in connection with the distribution of Spinco Distribution Debt or
Spinco Securities, whether prior to or subsequent to Closing, including by
issuing, on or prior to the time that the distribution of Spinco Distribution
Debt takes place, additional Spinco Distribution Debt to MWV or the MWV
Lenders, as applicable.

  

  

(f) The parties hereto (i) acknowledge that the MWV Commitment Letter
contemplates, and MWV desires to enter into, arrangements providing for the
exchange by MWV of Spinco Distribution Debt distributed to MWV as part of the
Special Dividend pursuant to the Separation Agreement in full satisfaction of
debt obligations of MWV borrowed pursuant to the MWV Commitment Letter (the
"MWV Debt") (such exchange, the "Debt Exchange"), which MWV Debt shall provide
net proceeds equal to the Above Basis Amount. Spinco shall issue Spinco
Distribution Debt to MWV at the Closing Date with an interest rate up to the
Total Cap if necessary to effectuate the Debt Exchange. Each of the parties
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Exchange to be
consummated with the holders of the MWV Debt (the "MWV Lenders"). Without
limitation of the foregoing (and in furtherance, not in limitation, of the
covenants set forth in Section 8.12(b) above):

  

  

(i) Subject to the second sentence of this Section 8.12(f), the Company shall
negotiate the terms and conditions of the Spinco Distribution Debt with the
MWV Lenders and shall keep MWV reasonably informed of all material
developments. The Company shall, in consultation with MWV, determine the final
form of the Spinco Distribution Debt and related agreements (including
registration rights arrangements and indenture). MWV shall, in consultation
with the Company, determine the arrangements relating to the Debt Exchange
with underwriters, arrangers and other third parties relating to the Debt
Exchange; provided that MWV shall keep the Company reasonably informed
regarding such arrangements. Spinco shall issue the Spinco Securities to MWV
on the terms negotiated by the Company on the Closing Date, and the Company
shall accept and execute applicable documentation, if any, relating to the
issuance of the Spinco Securities by Spinco and the transfer of the Spinco
Distribution Debt by MWV in satisfaction of the MWV Debt.

  

  

(ii) Each of MWV, Spinco and the Company shall cooperate in connection with
the preparation of all documents and the making of all filings required in
connection with the issuance of the Spinco Distribution Debt and the Debt
Exchange and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other

publicly withdrawn at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting) and (C) within twelve (12) months after the
termination of this Agreement, any Company Acquisition shall have been
consummated or any definitive agreement with respect to any Company
Acquisition shall have been entered into (the earlier of entry into such
agreement or the consummation thereof, the "Company Termination Fee Date"),
then, in either such case, the Company shall pay MWV a fee in the amount of
$15 million (the "Company Termination Fee") (less any amounts paid by the
Company to MWV pursuant to Section 10.3(a)(iii)) within two (2) Business Days
of the Company Termination Fee Date; provided that for purposes of determining
whether a Company Acquisition Proposal exists under this Section 10.3(a)(i),
solely for purposes of this Section 10.3, the term "Company Acquisition" shall
have the meaning ascribed thereto in ARTICLE I, except that all references in
such definition to 25% shall be changed to 50.1%;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

97  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(ii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by MWV pursuant to Section
10.1(g), the Company shall promptly, and in any event not more than two (2)
Business Days following such termination, pay MWV the Company Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds;

  

  

(iii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or
MWV pursuant to Section 10.1(f), the Company shall pay MWV all out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by MWV, Spinco and their respective Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "MWV
Expenses"); provided that the Company shall not be required to pay more than
an aggregate of $5 million in MWV Expenses pursuant to this Section
10.3(a)(iii). The Company shall promptly, and in any event not more than two
(2) Business Days following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(f), pay MWV the MWV Expenses by wire transfer of same day funds.
The payment of the expense reimbursement pursuant to this Section 10.3(a)(iii)
shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.3(a)(i) or Section 10.3(a)(ii).

  

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by MWV or the Company
pursuant to Section 10.1(b) and at the time of such termination, (i) the
conditions set forth in Section 9.2(e) shall not have been satisfied and (ii)
all other conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE IX have been satisfied
or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by the party having the
right to waive such conditions on or prior to the date of such termination
(and, in the case of those conditions that, by their nature, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, such conditions would be satisfied if the
Closing Date were to occur), then MWV shall pay the Company a fee in the
amount of $7.5 million (the "MWV Termination Fee") not more than two (2)
Business Days following such termination by wire transfer of same day funds.

  

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or MWV
pursuant to Section 10.1(b) and at the time of such termination, (i) the
conditions set forth in Section 9.2(f) shall not have been satisfied and (ii)
all other conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE IX have been satisfied
or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by the party having the
right to waive such conditions on or prior to the date of such termination
(and, in the case of those conditions that, by their nature, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, such conditions would be satisfied if the
Closing Date were to occur), then MWV shall pay to the Company a fee in the
amount of $20 million (the "Reverse Breakup Fee"), which fee shall be payable
to the Company not more than two (2) Business Days following such termination.

  

  

(d) Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall have no
further liability to MWV or Spinco or their respective stockholders with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
the obligation to pay any amounts payable pursuant to Section 10.3(e) and the
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee set forth in Section 10.3(a)(i)
or Section 10.3(a)(ii) if the circumstances provided for in such

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

98  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Section shall apply). Upon payment of the MWV Termination Fee or the Reverse
Breakup Fee, MWV shall have no further liability to the Company or Merger Sub
or their respective stockholders with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than the obligation to pay any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 10.3(e)). Notwithstanding the preceding, nothing
herein shall release any party from liability for fraud or willful breach or
as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay more than one
Company Termination Fee nor MWV be required to pay more than one MWV
Termination Fee or more than one Reverse Breakup Fee, nor shall MWV be
required to pay both the MWV Termination Fee and the Reverse Breakup Fee.

  

  

(e) In the event that the Company or MWV shall fail to pay when due any
Company Termination Fee (in the case of the Company) or the MWV Termination
Fee or the Reverse Breakup Fee (in the case of MWV) required to be paid by it
pursuant to this Section 10.3, such Company Termination Fee (in the case of
the Company) or MWV Termination Fee or Reverse Breakup Fee (in the case of
MWV) shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such Company
Termination Fee (in the case of the Company) or MWV Termination Fee or Reverse
Breakup Fee (in the case of MWV) became past due, at a rate equal to the sum
of (x) the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in
The Wall Street Journal plus (y) 5%, calculated on a daily basis until the
date of actual payment. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay the
Company Termination Fee when due or if MWV shall fail to pay the MWV
Termination Fee or Reverse Breakup Fee when due, the Company or MWV, as
applicable shall also pay to the other party all of the other party's costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), as applicable, in
connection with efforts to collect such amounts.

  

  

Section 10.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by MWV, Spinco, the
Company and Merger Sub at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made that by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation
system requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by MWV, Spinco, the Company and Merger Sub.

  

  

Section 10.5 Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, MWV, Spinco,
the Company and Merger Sub may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
any of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of any of the other parties contained herein;
provided, however, that no failure or delay by MWV, Spinco, the Company or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of MWV, Spinco, the Company or Merger Sub to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

Indemnification. The covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be
performed following the Closing pursuant to the Separation Agreement or this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time in accordance with their terms and
all other covenants and agreements herein and therein shall terminate and
shall not survive the Closing. None of the representations or warranties in
this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or any other covenant or agreement set forth herein shall survive
the Effective Time. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution

provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and
material furnished by any party or its representatives thereunder or
hereunder.

  

  

Section 11.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses (as defined below)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except (i) Expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Spinco

Agreement, "Expenses" means all out-of-pocket expenses (including applicable
filing and registration fees and all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and
its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and

Section 11.4 Interpretation.

  

  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

indicated. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of
reference only and are not intended to be a substantive part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereby,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have
the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes, including all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns. References to a date or time shall be deemed
to be such date or time in New York City, unless otherwise specified.
References to dollar amounts are to U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified.
Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. For
avoidance of doubt, "consistent with past practice" when used with respect to
Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries means the past practice of MWV with respect
to the CandOP Business. Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement, or any other Transaction Agreement, any
provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or consent of, or
exercise of any right of, a party, such party may give or withhold such
agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its sole and
absolute discretion.

  

  

(b) Any matter disclosed in any particular Section or Subsection of the MWV
Disclosure Letter, the MWV Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other Section or Subsection of
this Agreement, with respect to which such matter is relevant so long as the
applicability of such matter to such Section or Subsection is reasonably
apparent on its face.

  

  

Section 11.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared
judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have
the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it
being the intent and agreement of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall
be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to
render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such
modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that
is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

102  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

Section 11.6 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of all of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  

  

Section 11.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than MWV,
Spinco and the Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns)
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement, and no Person (other than as so specified)
shall be deemed a third party beneficiary under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each financing source under the
Spinco Commitment Letter and Related Letters shall be an express third party
beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon Section 11.10, Section 11.12
and Section 11.14 hereof, and each such financing source and its successors
and assigns may enforce such provisions.

  

  

Section 11.8 Limited Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or
representative of any of the parties hereto, in its capacity as such, shall
have any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties of such party under this Agreement or in respect
of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and, to the
fullest extent legally permissible, each of the parties hereto, for itself and
its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to
seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such Person otherwise
might have pursuant to applicable Law.

  

  

Section 11.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the other
Transaction Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and the
Disclosure Letters and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto)
constitutes the entire agreement of all the parties hereto and supersedes all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. All exhibits attached to this Agreement and the Disclosure Letters are
expressly made a part of, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

  

  

Section 11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and
any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of a party, the other party will
re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting party. No
party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

103  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means as
a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

  

  

Section 11.12 Jurisdiction; Consent to Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) Exclusive Jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any
claim, dispute or controversy (of any and every kind or type, whether based on
contract, tort, statute, regulation or otherwise, and whether based on state,
federal, foreign or any other law), arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the documents
referred to in this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby, and including disputes relating to the existence, validity, breach or
termination of this Agreement (any such claim being a "Covered Claim") may be
brought and determined in any federal or state court located in the State of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits in respect
of Covered Claims for itself and in respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it may be served with such legal process at the address and in the
manner set forth in Section 11.3. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding in respect of Covered
Claims (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve
process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. The
parties hereby further agree that New York state or United States Federal
courts sitting in the borough of Manhattan, City of New York shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over any action brought against any financing source
under the Spinco Commitment Letter and Related Letters in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii)

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

104  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS (b).

  

  

Section 11.13 Specific Performance. In the event of any actual or threatened
default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, the party who is, or is to be,
thereby aggrieved will have the right to specific performance and injunctive
or other equitable relief in respect of its rights under this Agreement or
such Transaction Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies at law or in equity. The parties agree that the remedies at law for
any breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate
compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements
for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived by each of
the parties to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.14 Certain Lender Agreements. MWV agrees, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives (collectively, the "MWV
Related Parties"), that the financing sources under the Spinco Commitment
Letter and Related Letters and their Affiliates, stockholders and
Representatives and each of their successors and assigns (i) shall be subject
to no liability or claims by the MWV Related Parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Spinco Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except with respect to the enforcement of the MWV
Commitment Letter) or in connection with the Spinco Financing, or the
performance of services by such financing sources or their Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to the foregoing and (ii) are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section (which may not be changed as to any financing
source without its prior written consent).
