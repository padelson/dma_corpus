based on any matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any court of the Province of Ontario, and each of the Parties
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that any such Proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under all applicable Laws. Process in any
Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on
such Party as provided in Section&nbsp;9.1 shall be deemed effective service. </FONT></P>

on its behalf, service of process in such jurisdiction in any legal action or Proceedings with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and such service shall be deemed
complete upon delivery thereof to the Process Agent; provided that in the case of any such service upon the Process Agent, the Party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to the
Parent in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;9.1. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all such action as may be necessary to continue said appointment in full force and effect or to
appoint another agent so that each of the Parent and the Purchaser shall at all times have an agent for service of process for the above purposes in the Province of Ontario. In the event of the
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Process Agent to any other entity by consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise, such other entity shall be substituted
hereunder for the Process Agent with the same effect as if named herein in place of Norton Rose Canada&nbsp;LLP. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner
permitted by applicable Law. </FONT></P>
