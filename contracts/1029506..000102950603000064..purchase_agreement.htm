Representative (on behalf of all the Sellers) within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date. The Seller Representative shall review the Net Asset Schedule

shall be entitled to review the Companys working papers, trial balances and
similar materials relating to the Companys preparation of its balance sheet
as of the Closing Date. The Net Asset Schedule shall be deemed final upon the
earliest of (i) the date on which the Seller Representative and the Buyer
agree that the Net Asset Schedule is final, (ii) if the Seller Representative
has not earlier notified the Buyer, in writing, of a dispute in amounts shown
on the Net Asset Schedule, the twentieth (20th) day after delivery of the Net
Asset Schedule by the Buyer to the Seller Representative, and (iii) the date
on which any disputes relating to the Net Asset Schedule are resolved, as
described in this Section 2.3 . The Net Assets, determined by reference to the
final Net Asset Schedule, is referred to herein as the "Closing Date Net

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any disputes
regarding amounts shown in the Net Asset Schedule shall be resolved as set
forth in this Section 2.3(d)(ii) .

 



 

(A) In the event that the Seller Representative disputes an amount shown on
the Net Asset Schedule initially delivered by the Buyer to the Seller
Representative in accordance with Section 2.3(d)(i) , the Seller
Representative shall provide timely written notice of each disputed item
(each, a "Disputed Item") to the Buyer (the "Dispute Notice," and, the date of
its delivery, the "Dispute Notice Date") specifying the amount in dispute
(including the Seller Representatives calculation of the Net Assets) and
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute. Within twenty
(20) business days following the Dispute Notice Date, the Disputed Items shall
be submitted to Deloitte and Touche (the "Arbiter") (it being understood that
Deloitte and Touche was chosen because of representations made that none of the
Buyer, the Company, the Sellers or their respective Affiliates have a material
relationship with Deloitte and Touche, and if any such Parties prior to the
calculation of the Closing Date Net Assets develops a material relationship
with Deloitte and Touche, the Party having such relationship shall promptly
notify the other Parties of such relationship and the Seller Representative
and the Buyer will select another national accounting firm with which none of
such Parties has a material relationship to serve as the Arbiter). Each of the
Seller Representative and Buyer shall then submit evidence in support of its
position on each Disputed Item.

 



 

(B) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge
that the Purchase Price adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.3 is
intended to reflect the difference between Net Assets as shown on the Net
Asset Schedule and the Targeted Amount, and the Parties further acknowledge
that such difference can only be measured if the calculation of Net Assets is
performed in the same way, using the same methods, as of all relevant dates.
The scope of the Disputed Items to be resolved by the Arbiter is limited,
therefore, to whether the Net Asset Schedule was prepared in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Upon final resolution of all Disputed Items, the
Arbiter shall issue a report showing a calculation of the Closing Date Net
Assets.

 



 

(C) The Arbiter shall make its determination of the Disputed Items, and such
determination shall be binding and conclusive on the Parties. The Parties
shall cooperate fully in assisting the Arbiter in calculating the Disputed
Items and shall take such actions as are necessary to expedite and to cause
the Arbiter to expedite such calculation. The Arbiter shall act as an expert
and not as an arbitrator.

 



 

(D) The Buyer shall bear a percentage of the fees and expenses of the Arbiter
that equals (i) the difference between the Buyers calculation of Net Assets
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(i) and the Arbiters calculation of
Closing Date Net Assets divided by (ii) the total difference between the
Buyers calculation of Net Assets delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(i) and
the Sellers calculation of Net Assets delivered pursuant to Section
2.3(d)(ii)(A) .

 



 

(E) The Sellers shall bear a percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Arbiter that equals (i) the difference between Sellers calculation of Net
Assets delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(ii)(A) and the Arbiters
calculation of Net Assets divided by (ii) the total difference between the
Sellers calculation of Net Assets delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(ii)(A)
and the Buyers calculation of Net Assets delivered pursuant to Section
2.3(d)(i) . The Sellers obligation to pay such amount shall be satisfied
solely from the Escrow Funds. The obligation of any Seller to pay such amount
shall be several and limited to such Seller\'s Pro Rata Portion of such
amount.

 



 

2.4 Options . Each holder of Options agrees (a) to exercise his or her
Options at the Closing, (b) to deliver to the Company (not less than two (2)
business days prior to the Closing Date) an executed notice of such exercise,
and (c) to deliver (not less than two (2) business days prior to the Closing
Date) a written direction to the Buyer to deduct from the portion of the
Estimated Cash Payment otherwise payable to such Seller hereunder an amount
equal to the applicable exercise price (plus the amount of any required
Federal, state or local withholding Taxes payable by the Company with respect
to such exercise) and to pay such amount to the Company.

 



 

2.5 Redemption of Preferred Stock .

 



 

(a) As a condition to the Closing and in accordance with Section 2.1 , the
Sellers shall cause the Company to redeem (the "Redemption") all of the
Companys issued and outstanding shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred
Stock, $0.01 par value (the "Preferred Stock"). All of the foregoing issued
and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are collectively referred to as the
"Preferred Shares", and each a "Preferred Share".

 



 

(b) Upon presentment to the Buyer at Closing of certificates or lost share
affidavits with appropriate indemnities representing the redeemed shares of

contribution to the Company, an amount equal to the sum of (i) $10.00 per

dividends owed with respect to each such Preferred Share as of the Closing
Date, in full payment for the Redemption (the aggregate amount payable by the
Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) being referred to herein as the
"Redemption Amount").

 



 

(c) Each of the Preferred Holders hereby waives any notice of the Redemption
that may be required under the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation
in connection with the Redemption. Each Preferred Holder hereby agrees to

such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries organizational documents.

Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate with the Company in exchanging such
information and assistance as the Company may reasonably request in connection
with all of the foregoing.

Person who is as of the Closing Date an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, before the Closing Date, to the same
extent as such Person was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for
such service under any similar Plans, except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each such Person shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by Buyer for the benefit of its employees (such plans,
collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces the coverage under a comparable Plan in which such Person
participated immediately before the Closing Date (such Plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any such Person, Buyer shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

applicable employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries the amount of their

the aggregate amount set forth on the Companys and its Subsidiaries
financial statements as of the Closing Date and reflected in the calculation
of the Closing Date Net Assets, which such bonus payments will be paid at such
time as bonus payments for the current fiscal year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are payable under the terms of the applicable bonus or incentive
program documents, agreements or plans as in effect on the date hereof;
provided, however, that Buyer shall only be required to cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to make such bonus payments to the extent such bonus payments
are actually earned in accordance with the terms of the applicable bonus or
incentive program documents, agreements or plans as in effect on the date
hereof.

9.1 Incorporation by Reference . If and to the extent any information
required to be furnished in any Schedule or Exhibit is contained in this
Agreement or in any other Schedule or Exhibit (or updated Schedule or
Exhibit), such information shall be deemed to be included in all Schedules or
Exhibits (or updated Schedules or Exhibits) in which the information is
required to be included if, and only to the extent, the description of the
facts regarding the event items or matter disclosed is sufficiently detailed,
accurate and complete so as to make it reasonably apparent that such
disclosure is applicable to such other Schedule or Exhibit. The inclusion of

of the Sellers or Preferred Holders, in and of itself, that such information
is material to or outside the Ordinary Course of the Business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

9.2 Independent Investigation . Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to
its satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification in addition to the representations and
warranties of the Company and the Sellers and the Preferred Holders expressly
and specifically set forth in this Agreement, including the Schedules and
Exhibits (and updated Schedules and Exhibits). SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY AND THE SELLERS AND THE PREFERRED HOLDERS CONSTITUTE
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENT ATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND THE
SELLERS AND THE PREFERRED HOLDERS TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL
FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE
COMPANY) ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY AND THE SELLERS AND THE
PREFERRED HOLDERS.

 



 

9.3 Tax Matters .

 



 

(a) Tax Indemnification . Sellers agree to be responsible for and to
indemnify Buyer and hold it harmless from and against all Taxes (or the non-
payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and the period through the end of the
Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date; provided however, that Sellers shall be liable only to the
extent such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any accrued for (excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) on the Closing Balance Sheet and taken into
account in determining the Purchase Price Adjustment. Buyer agrees to be
responsible for and to indemnify the Sellers and hold them harmless from and
against all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods after the Closing Date. Sellers shall
reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are
the responsibility of Sellers pursuant to this Section 9.3 within 10 business
days of the due date of the taxes payable. Buyer shall reimburse the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) for any Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which are the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to this Section
9.3 (the "Seller Tax Refund") within 10 business days of the date any such
Taxes (the "Company Taxes") are paid by any of the Sellers (such paying
Seller(s) being referred to herein as the "Tax Paying Sellers").

 



 

(b) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns . The Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers and the Preferred Holders) shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns
(including any amended Tax Return which the Seller Representative may file in
its sole discretion) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax
Period") including the short period consolidated return for the Company and
its Subsidiaries ending at the end of the day on the Closing Date. The Seller
Representative shall provide Buyer copies of such Tax Returns at least 30 days
prior to the due date for filing such return, provided, however, that Buyer
shall have no right to dispute or request changes to such Tax Returns. Buyer
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a
timely basis all other Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Neither Buyer, the Company nor any Subsidiary shall file any Tax
Return (amended or otherwise) with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary
for any Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative.

 



 

(c) Transaction Costs . All payments and accruals made by the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, any
payments for the exercise of the options pursuant to Section 2.4 or any other
compensatory payments, management or consulting fees and other items set forth
on Schedule 3 shall be allocable to a day on or before the Closing Date and
not allocable to the portion of the day after the Closing Date pursuant to
Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

 



 

(d) Transfer Taxes . Buyer and Sellers shall share equally any real property
transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax
imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries or one or more Sellers as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The
Sellers and Preferred Holders agree to cooperate with Buyer in the filing of
any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying
any information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete
such returns.

 



 

(e) Cooperation . (i) Sellers, the Preferred Holders, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other and the
Seller Representative all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in
resolving all disputes, litigation, audits or other proceedings with respect
to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer and the Sellers and the
Preferred Holders recognize that the Sellers and the Preferred Holders may
need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting
and tax records and information held by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to
the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, their
affiliates and successors to (1) retain and maintain such records and
information until such time as the Seller Representative agrees in writing
that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary, and (2) allow the
Seller Representative (and agents and representatives of any Seller or
Preferred Holder) to inspect, review and make copies of such records and
information as the Seller Representative or agent and representative of a
Seller or Preferred Holder may deem necessary or appropriate from time to
time. (ii) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the Transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(f) Tax Audits . (i) Each of the Buyer (each a "Recipient") on the one hand,
and the Seller Representative, on the other hand, shall notify the other party
in writing within 10 days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any
pending or threatened audit, notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, examination or other administration or court proceeding, suit,
dispute or other claim which could affect the liability for Taxes of such
other party (a "Tax Claim"). If the Recipient fails to give such prompt notice
to the other party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes
arising in connection with such Tax Claim if and to the extent that such
failure to give notice materially and adversely affects the other partys
right to participate in the Tax Claim; provided, however, that one party will
be obligated to indemnify the other party pursuant to Section 9.3(a) or
otherwise only if the indemnifying party receives written notice thereof prior
to the end of the applicable statute of limitations for the relevant taxable
year or period. (ii) the Seller Representative shall have the sole right to
represent the Company and each of its Subsidiaries interest in any Tax Claim
relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense. Seller Representative agrees that it
will not settle any such proceeding in a manner which materially and adversely
affects the Company or its Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends after
the Closing Date. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Seller Representative
shall be entitled to participate at its expense in any Tax Claim relating in
any part to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period deemed
to end on or before the Closing Date, and with the written consent of the
Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), at the Seller
Representatives sole expense, may assume the control of such entire Tax
Claim. None of the Buyer, any of its affiliates, the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries may settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax Claim for
which the Sellers may have a liability under this Agreement, or which may
result in an increase in Sellers liability under this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent may be
withheld in the sole discretion of the Sellers, unless the Buyer fully
indemnifies the Sellers in writing with respect to such liability in a manner
satisfactory to the Sellers.

 



 

(g) Refunds and Credits. Any refunds or credits of Taxes (to the extent not
accrued for on the Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in determining
the Purchase Price Adjustment) of the Company or any Subsidiary plus any
interest received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, without limitation, refunds or
credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date)
shall be for the account of the Sellers and shall be paid by Buyer to the
Seller Representative within ten (10) days after the Buyer or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries receives such refund or after the relevant Tax Return
is filed in which a credit is applied against Buyers, the Companys, any
Subsidiarys, or any of their successors liability for Taxes.

 



 

(h) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements or
arrangements, written or unwritten, between the Sellers and the Company or
Subsidiaries of the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing.

 



 

(i) Disputes. If the Buyer and Sellers disagree as to the amount of any
payment relating to Taxes or the interpretation or application of any
provision of this Agreement relating to Taxes, the parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve such dispute, and any agreed upon amount shall be paid
to the appropriate party. If such dispute is not resolved within 15 days, the
parties shall submit the matter to the Arbiter. The fees and expenses of the
Arbiter shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyer in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Arbiter, which proportionate
allocation will also be determined by the Arbiter at the time it renders its
determination on the merits of the matters submitted to it. The determination
of the Arbiter shall be final and binding upon the Buyer and the Sellers,
shall be deemed a final determination that is binding on each of the Buyer and
the Sellers, and no party shall seek further recourse to courts, other
tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce such determination. Judgment may
be entered to enforce the Arbiters determination in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is enforced.

 



 

9.4 Additional Documents and Instruments . From time to time, as and when
requested by any Party hereto and at such Party\'s expense, any other Party
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Seller under the terms of the Escrow Agreement the reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable professional fees) incurred by, or reasonably
anticipated by the Sellers Representative to be incurred by, the Seller
Representative in connection with the representation of the Sellers in any
proceeding arising out of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all
matters concerning claims for indemnification under Section 12.2(a) of the
Purchase Agreement) or the transactions or agreements related hereto (the
"Seller Representative Fees") and to pay the Seller Representative Fees to the
Seller Representative, provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Seller Representative shall not have the authority to increase the
liability or obligations of the Holders or to reduce the Purchase Price
without the prior written consent of the Sellers. Each of the Sellers and
Preferred Holders agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Seller
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Seller or Preferred Holder. All decisions
and actions by the Seller Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Sellers and Preferred Holders, and
no Seller or Preferred Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same.

 



 

10.3 Indemnification; Disbursement of Seller Tax Refund . Each Seller and
Preferred Holder hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative against all expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Seller
Representative is made a party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as
the Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Seller
Representative hereby agrees to promptly disburse to each Tax Paying Seller
such Sellers pro rata portion (based on the percentage of Company Taxes paid
by such Seller) of the Seller Tax Refund received by the Seller Representative
pursuant to Section 9.3(a) hereof. Promptly upon resolution of the underlying
claims relating thereto, the Seller Representative hereby agrees to disburse
to each of the Sellers such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Seller
Representative Fees withheld from the Escrow Funds.

 



 

10.4 No Liability . Neither the Seller Representative nor any agent employed
by it shall incur any liability to any Seller or Preferred Holder by virtue of
the failure or refusal of the Seller Representative for any reason to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance
of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting
fraud or bad faith.

(f) An Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys request,
cooperate in the defense of any matter subject to indemnification hereunder.
Each Indemnified Party shall seek to collect any amounts available under
insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for
any Indemnifiable Losses to the same extent that the Indemnified Party would
if such Indemnifiable Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(g) The amount of any Indemnifiable Losses payable under Section 12.2 by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of (i) amounts recovered or recoverable under
applicable insurance policies, from any other third party with indemnification
obligations or from any other Person responsible therefor and (ii) the Tax
benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence
or payment of any such Indemnifiable Losses. If an Indemnified Party receives
any amounts under applicable insurance policies, from any other third party
with indemnification obligations or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Indemnifiable Losses, subsequent to an indemnification
payment by any Indemnifying Party and provided the Indemnified Party has
collected all sums due from the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(h) The Sellers and, to the extent applicable, the Preferred Holders, shall
not be liable under Section 12.2(a) or Section 12.2(b) to the extent (i) Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses relating to any matter that (A) with respect to Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses arising from a warranty breach, is included in the
Closing Date Net Assets or Latest Balance Sheet to the extent set forth as a
specific liability or reserve or (B) the Buyer had otherwise been adequately
compensated for pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.3 or
(ii) consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages.

 



 

(i) Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize the
Indemnifiable Losses to the maximum content reasonably possible upon and after
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably expected to give rise to
any Indemnifiable Losses. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer agrees to
cause the Company to pursue in good faith recovery for the Wrongful Death
Claim under all applicable insurance policies.

 



 

(j) If an Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses and the Indemnified Party could have
recovered all or part of such Indemnifiable Losses from a third party (a
"Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted against the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to
proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment.

 



 

(k) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer waives any
rights and claims it may have against the Holders, whether in law or in
equity, relating to, the Company, the Stock, the Preferred Stock, or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by the Buyer
include, without limitation, claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any environmental, health or safety
statute, law, regulation or rule, claims for breach of contract, breach or
representation or warranty, negligent representation and all other claims for
such breach of duty. Excluding the right to seek specific performance or other
equitable relief, after the Closing, this Article 12 will provide the
exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or
other agreement other than as provided in Sections 2.3(d)(ii) .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer does not waive any claim or right of
recovery against the Sellers and Preferred Holders, and the Sellers and the
Preferred Holders do not waive any claim or right of recovery against the
Buyer, that are in addition to the remedies provided in this Agreement to the
extent a claim or right of recovery is based on the fraud of the Sellers or
Preferred Holders in the first case or based on the fraud of the Buyer in the
second case.

 



 

12.4 Matters Involving Third Parties .

 



 

(a) If any third party shall notify an Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the Indemnifying Party under this Article 12 , then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys
choice, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party, within twenty (20) business
days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim to
the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of
such Third Party Claim and will indemnify the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms and limitations of this Article
12 and (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim in an active and diligent manner.

 



 

(c) So long as the conditions set forth in Section 12.4(b) are and remain
satisfied, then (i) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 12.4(b) , (ii) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party will not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter, or
enter into any settlement which either imposes an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or does not include a provision
whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Party
from all liability with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) The Sellers and the Buyer shall treat any payments that the Buyer and the
Sellers receive pursuant to this Article 12 as an adjustment to and refund of
the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes, unless a final determination
(which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with
respect to the Buyer and the Sellers causes such payment not to be treated as
an adjustment to or refund of the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes.

 



 

12.5 Failure to Give Notice. The failure of an Indemnified Party to timely
give notice of indemnification required under this Article 12 shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations, except
(i) to the extent that such failure adversely affects the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to defend such claim (including Third Party Claims)
asserted by the Indemnified Party, (ii) such notice is given after the
expiration of the applicable survival period contained herein or (iii) the
Indemnifying Party is otherwise prejudiced by such failure.

determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision

arise favoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions
of this Agreement. Any reference to any United States, state, local, or other

Agreement. Reference in this Agreement to any legal term for any law, action,
remedy, method of judicial proceeding, legal document, legal status, court,
official or any other legal concept or thing shall in respect of any
jurisdiction other than the United States be deemed to include that legal
concept or thing in that other jurisdiction which most nearly approximates
that United States legal term (in addition to any other analogous legal
concept or term specified). The Schedules and Exhibits identified in this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Where
any provision in this Agreement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or
