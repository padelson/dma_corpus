 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 16, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among COWEN GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), LOUISIANA MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and LABRANCHE and CO INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H:_

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be converted into the right to receive shares of Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent entering into this Agreement and incurring
the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent is entering into a voting agreement with certain
stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to
which, among other things, each of those stockholders has agreed, subject to
the terms thereof, to vote all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
stockholder in accordance with the terms of the Company Voting Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the Company entering into this Agreement incurring
the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Company is entering into a voting agreement with a
stockholder of Parent (the " _Parent Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to which,
among other things, that stockholder has agreed, subject to the terms thereof,
to vote all shares of Parent Common Stock owned by such stockholder in
accordance with the terms of the Parent Voting Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 



 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
intend that the Merger and the Second Step Merger, taken together, shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Treasury Regulations_ "), and, by
approving resolutions authorizing this Agreement, to adopt this Agreement as a
plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations.

 



      
 

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I.

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and
the Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_
"), shall by virtue of the Merger continue its existence under the Laws of the
State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.1_, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place on a date to be specified by the parties which
shall be no later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable Law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by
their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the
Closing) set forth in Article VIII, unless another time or date is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto (the date of the Closing, the " _Closing
Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Company.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Company after the Effective Time shall be in the form set
forth as Exhibit A hereto, and thereafter may be amended as provided therein
or by Law.

 



 

Section 1.6. _By-Laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company,
and, thereafter, may be amended as provided therein or by Law, in each case
consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 6.3_, except that
references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the
name of the Surviving Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.7. _Directors; Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company
and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each case, until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified or until their death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Company, as applicable.

 



 

Section 1.8. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof:

 



 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 0.998
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock, subject to _Section 2.5_ with respect to fractional shares (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "), other than any shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by, or held in the treasury of, the Company.

 



 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, including the amount of cash, if any, payable
in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.5_ and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled
all in accordance with _Article II_ upon the surrender of such Certificate.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

 



 

(d) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent Common Stock or the
Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable, or otherwise
change the Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock into any other
securities, or make any other such stock dividend or distribution in capital
stock of Parent or the Company in respect of the Parent Common Stock or the
Company Common Stock, respectively, then any number or amount contained herein
which is based upon the price of the Parent Common Stock or the number of
shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or
other distribution or change to provide to Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

 



 

Section 1.9. _Treatment of Options and Other Stock Awards_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate (which shall
include obtaining written consent from each option holder) in accordance with
the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Stock Plans to provide that upon the Effective Time, each outstanding stock
option to purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Company Options_ "),
whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled for no
consideration.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take all such actions as may be required to (i) ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no
rights with respect thereto and (ii) cause the Company Stock Plans to
terminate effective no later than the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 1.10. _Second Step Merger_.

 



 

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to be merged with and into a direct, wholly owned Delaware limited
liability company subsidiary of Parent that is a "disregarded entity" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(b)(1)(i)(A) (the "
_Disregarded Subsidiary_ "), with the Disregarded Subsidiary surviving such
merger (the " _Second Step Merger_ "). No consideration shall be issued in the
Second Step Merger. The Second Step Merger shall be consummated in a manner
consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(b) After the Second Step Merger, references herein to the Surviving Company
shall refer to the Disregarded Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) The Merger and the Second Step Merger, taken together, are intended to be
treated as a "reorganization" for United States federal income tax purposes
under Section 368(a) of the Code in which the Company is to be treated as
merging directly with and into Disregarded Subsidiary with the Company Common
Stock converted in such merger into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

ARTICLE II.

 



 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



 

Section 2.1. _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with The Bank of New York Mellon or such other bank or trust company
as Parent shall determine and who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with _Section
1.8_, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, in
accordance with the terms of _Section 2.2_ of this Agreement, the aggregate
Merger Consideration, including the amount of cash, if any, payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5_. Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.3_. Any Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund._ "

 



 

Section 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event more than three Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Exchange Agent to send to each record holder of a Certificate, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that

 



      
 

 



 

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
Parent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Each holder
of a Certificate, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
(including in respect of any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5_, if any, or dividends or other
distributions to which holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_, if
any), into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the applicable Merger Consideration, a check
in the proper amount of any cash payment, dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_,
may be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee
only if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Distributions and Voting with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
(b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such shares of Parent Common Stock. Any shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.8_ hereof shall not be entitled to vote
on any matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote, the record date of
which vote occurs prior to such surrender.

 



 

Section 2.4. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of _Article I_ and this _Article II_
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_) shall
be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.5. _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or
scrip representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 1.8_ hereof, but in lieu thereof, each holder of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by $4.72.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates as of the day
immediately prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall be
delivered to the Surviving Company or otherwise on the instruction of the
Surviving Company, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Company and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.8_ and any cash payments, dividends or distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_.

 



 

Section 2.7. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration (including in respect of any cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.5_) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.5_), and any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.9. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and
Treasury Regulations, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company, Parent or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.10. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business, New York time,
on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby,
and any cash payments, dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_.

to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. True, complete and correct
copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company

Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement, will conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or give rise to any obligation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to make any payment under, or to the increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person
under, or result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, any provisions of (i) the
Company Charter or the Company By-Laws; (ii) any Contract or Permit to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; (iii) any judgment, order,

violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations,

Disclosure Schedule, no consents or approval of or filings or registrations
with or notice to any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity or any other
Person are necessary in connection with (i) the execution and delivery by the

10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company
Preferred Stock_ "), of which, as of the Company Capitalization Date, no
shares were issued and outstanding. As of the Company Capitalization Date, the
Company held 21,722,433 shares of Company Common Stock in its treasury. As of
the Company Capitalization Date, no shares of Company Common Stock or Company

Company Common Stock reserved for issuance in connection with existing awards
under employee benefit, stock option and dividend reinvestment and stock
purchase plans and 1,934,257 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for

been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof and have not been issued in violation of any applicable Law
or any Contract of the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any
matters on which stockholders of Company may vote (" _Company Voting Debt_ ")
are issued or

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, except pursuant to this
Agreement, and other than as set forth in _Section 3.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have and is not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of, or the
payment of any amount based on, any shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Company Voting Debt or any other equity securities of the
Company or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Company
Voting Debt or other equity securities of the Company. As of the date of this
Agreement, except pursuant to this Agreement, and other than as set forth in
_Section 3.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
equity security of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or could be
required to register shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Company under the Securities Act.

 



 

(b) _Section 3.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to Company Options that were outstanding as of the Company
Capitalization Date and the names of the holders and the weighted average
exercise price for such Company Options. Other than the Company Options that
are outstanding as of the Company Capitalization Date, no other subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of character
calling for the purchase or issuance of, or the payment of any amount based
on, any shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Company
Voting Debt or other equity securities of the Company are outstanding as of
the Company Capitalization Date. Since the Company Capitalization Date through
the date hereof, the Company has not (i) issued or repurchased any shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Company Voting Debt or other
equity securities of the Company or (ii) issued or awarded or committed to
issue or award any options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares,
restricted stock units, deferred equity units, awards based on the value of
the Company capital stock or any other equity-based awards under any of the
Company Stock Plans or Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(c) All grants of Company Options and any other grants of stock options or
other equity interests were validly issued and properly approved by the
Companys Board of Directors (and all required approvals by the stockholders
of the Company have been obtained) in accordance with all applicable Law and
no such grants involved any "backdating" or similar practices with respect to
the effective date of grant. The per share exercise price of each Company
Option was not less than the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on
the applicable grant date (as determined in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(5)(iv)) and each such grant was properly accounted for
in all material respects in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
(including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Companys
filings with the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act and other applicable
securities Laws. No modifications have been made to any Company Options after
the applicable date of grant.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
ownership interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Liens, and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No Subsidiary
of the Company has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary. Except as set forth in _Section 3.4(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have any Subsidiaries and
does not own any capital stock or other equity or voting securities or other
rights convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity or voting
securities, or any other rights, interests or investments, in any other
Person.

 



 

(e) The Company has no rights plan, "poison-pill" or other similar agreement
or arrangement or any anti-takeover provision in the Company Organizational
Documents that is, or at the Effective Time shall be, applicable to the
Company, the Company Common Stock, the Company Preferred Stock, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) As of the date hereof, (i) the Company Consolidated Tangible Book Equity
is greater than or equal to $193,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate value of the
assets reflected on the Unaudited Company Balance Sheet is less than or equal
to four and one-half times the Company Consolidated Tangible Book Equity, in
each case, calculated as of the date hereof.

forms, documents and reports required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act on or after January 1, 2008 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ ").
No such Company SEC Report, at the time filed or furnished (and, in the case
of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their
respective dates, all Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(a) The financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included (or

all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,

or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

 



 

(c) The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide

reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
The disclosures made pursuant to _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_ were made in writing by
management to the Companys auditors and audit committee, a copy of which has
previously been made available to Parent.

 



 

(d) Since December 31, 2009, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices.

Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, pursuant to a letter agreement, a true, complete and
correct copy of which has been previously delivered or made available to
Parent.

 



 

Section 3.8. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2009 through and including the date of this Agreement,

except as set forth on _Section 3.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses
in all material respects in the Ordinary Course of Business and none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after

set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_.

 



 

Section 3.9. _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any,
and there are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, suits or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature by or against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of
its or its Subsidiaries employees with respect to its business, or to which
any of their assets are subject, the outcome of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

 



 

(b) There is no material judgment, settlement agreement, order, injunction,
decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that,
upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries).

 



 

Section 3.10. _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, (i) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has (a) duly and timely
filed (including all applicable extensions) all federal income Tax Returns and
other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date

material respects) and (b) has paid all Taxes due and owing by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return); (ii) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any
extension of time in excess of six months within which to file any Tax Return;
(iii) federal, state and local income Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS or other relevant taxing authority,
or the statute of limitations for assessment with respect to such Tax Returns
has expired, for all years to and including 2004, and any liability with
respect thereto has been satisfied or any liability with respect to
deficiencies asserted as a result of such examination is covered by reserves
that are adequate under GAAP; (iv) to the Companys knowledge, no claim has
ever been made by an

 



      
 

 



 

authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does
not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction; (v) there are no Liens for Taxes

any person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries under Regulation

liabilities for Taxes not yet due and payable, or which are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings, with respect to the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries (X) did not, as of December 31, 2009, exceed by a material
amount the reserve for Tax liabilities set forth on the face of the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and (Y) do not exceed by
a material amount that reserve as adjusted for Tax liabilities incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has a permanent establishment outside of the national jurisdiction in which it
was formed. There are no material disputes pending, or written claims
asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for which the Company does not have reserves that are adequate under GAAP.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries).
Within the past two (2) years, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b). As
of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger and the
Second Step Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Company or its Subsidiaries or under which the Company or any Subsidiary has
any current or potential liability. All such plans, agreements, programs,
policies and arrangements are collectively referred to as the " _Company
Benefit Plans_ ".

 



 

(b) The Company has provided or made available to Parent or its counsel with

of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code has, within the past six (6)
years, been incurred by the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate that has
not been satisfied in full, and, to the Companys knowledge, no condition
exists that presents a material risk of incurring any such liability. No event
has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by reason of its affiliation with any current or former
member of its "controlled group" (within the meaning of Section 414 of the
Code) to any (i) material Tax, penalty, fine, (ii) Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) or (iii) other material liability imposed by ERISA, the Code
or other applicable Laws.

 



 

(d) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, and none of the Company, or any Company ERISA Affiliate has
withdrawn at any time within the preceding six (6) years from any
multiemployer plan, or incurred any withdrawal liability which remains
unsatisfied, and no events have occurred and no circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify

of any prototype plans) from the IRS that it is so qualified and that its
trust is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred with respect to the operation of any such plan which could reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the
imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
actions, claims or lawsuits against or relating to the Company Benefit Plans,

respect to the operation of such plans (other than routine benefits claims).

 



 

(g) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms, and in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws. All contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any
of the Company Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or
in connection therewith have been made by the due date thereof and all
contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date which are

increase the amount of any compensation or benefits due, to any current or
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Company Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such compensation or benefits; (iv) result in a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section

manner relates to its risk management or compliance policies, its internal
controls, its management or its business, other than those of general
application that apply to similarly situated companies or their Subsidiaries
(each item in this sentence, a " _Company Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2007 by
any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing,
initiating, ordering, or requesting any such Company Regulatory Agreement.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to a "statutory
disqualification" as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act or
subject to a disqualification that would be a basis for material limitations
on the activities, functions or operations of, or suspension or revocation of
the registration of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as a broker-dealer,
municipal securities dealer, government securities broker or government
securities dealer under Section 15, Section 15B or Section 15C of the Exchange
Act, or performing similar functions under the Laws of other jurisdictions,
and there is no reasonable basis for, or formal proceeding or written notice
of investigation (or, to the Companys knowledge, any informal proceeding or
investigation) by any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, whether
preliminary or otherwise, that is reasonably likely to result in, any such
limitation, suspension or revocation.

 



 

(d) The Company has previously made available to Parent an accurate and
complete copy of each Form BD or amendment thereto, statement, or other
regulatory report, filed with or furnished to the SEC, FINRA, any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or the rules thereunder or
the rules of FINRA and any Governmental entity or Regulatory Agency, on or
after January 1, 2007 (the " _Company Regulatory Reports_ "). No such Company
Regulatory Report, at the time filed or furnished, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information as of a later date (but prior to the date hereof) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Company Regulatory Reports complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA,
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity or with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) _Section 3.17(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of
all Permits which are required for the operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries currently has all Permits which are required for the
operation of its business as presently conducted and as presently intended to
be conducted, other than those the failure of which to possess, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Companys knowledge, (i) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default or violation, and no event
has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute
a default or a violation, in any material respect of term, condition or
provision of any material Permit to which it is a party, to which its business
is subject or by which its properties or

 



      
 

 



 

assets are bound and (ii) there are no facts or circumstances which would
reasonably be expected to form the basis for any such default or violation.
Each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or each "person
associated" (as defined in Section 3(a)(18) of the Exchange Act) with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, who is required to be registered or
licensed as a registered representative, investment advisor representative,
sales person or an equivalent person with any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency is fully registered or licensed as such and such
registration is in full force and effect, and there is no formal proceeding or
written notice of investigation (or to the Companys knowledge, no informal
proceeding or investigation) by any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency,
whether preliminary or otherwise, that is reasonably likely to require any
additional registration or licensing of such persons.

 



 

(f) The Company is not (taking into account any applicable exemption)
ineligible under Section 9(a) or 9(b) of the Investment Company Act to serve
in a capacity described therein. There is no proceeding or investigation
pending and served on the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, pending
and not so served or threatened by any Governmental Entity, which would result
in the ineligibility of the Company to serve in any such capacities. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act.

 



 

(g) The Company is not (taking into account any applicable exemption)
ineligible under Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act to serve as a "person
associated" with an investment adviser. There is no proceeding or
investigation pending and served on the Company or, to the knowledge of the
Company, pending and not so served or threatened by any Governmental Entity,
which would result in the ineligibility under such Section 203(f) of the
Company to serve as a "person associated" with an investment adviser.

 



 

(h) With respect to the Company and each Subsidiary that acts as a broker or
dealer within the meaning of the Exchange Act, (i) such person is not (taking
into account any applicable exemption) ineligible pursuant to Section 15(b)(4)
of the Exchange Act to act as a broker or dealer, (ii) no "person associated"
(as defined in Section 3(a)(18) of the Exchange Act) with such person is
(taking into account any applicable exemption) ineligible under Section
15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act to serve as a "person associated" with a broker
or dealer and (iii) there is no proceeding or investigation pending and served
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys knowledge,
pending and not so served or threatened by any Governmental Entity, which
would result in (A) the ineligibility under such Section 15(b)(4) of such
person to act as a broker or dealer or (B) the ineligibility under such
Section 15(b)(6) of such "person associated" with such person to serve as a
"person associated" with a broker or dealer.

 



 

(i) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries are (i) a commodity pool operator,
futures commission merchant, commodity trading advisor, introducing broker,
investment adviser, insurance agent, transfer agent, bank or real estate
broker within the meaning of any applicable Law; (ii) required to be
registered, licensed or qualified as a commodity pool operator, futures
commission merchant, commodity trading advisor, introducing broker, investment
adviser, bank, insurance agent, transfer agent or real estate broker under any
applicable Law; or (iii) subject to any liability or disability by reason of
any failure to be so registered, licensed or qualified if required by
applicable Law. Neither the Company nor any of

 



       
 

 



 

its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any proceeding concerning any
failure to obtain any commodity pool operator, futures commission merchant,
commodity trading advisor, introducing broker, investment adviser, insurance
agent, transfer agent, bank or real estate broker registration, license or
qualification.

 



 

(j) All exchange traded, over-the-counter or other swaps, caps, floors,
collars, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar
arrangements or Contracts (collectively, " _Derivatives Contracts_ "), if any,
whether entered into for the Companys own account, or for the account of one
or more of its Subsidiaries or their customers, were entered into (i) in the
Ordinary Course of Business and comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws and the Companys and, as applicable, its Subsidiaries
existing regulatory authorizations and (ii) with counterparties reasonably
believed to be financially responsible at the time; and each of them
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and are
in full force and effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or,
to the Companys knowledge, any other party thereto, is in breach of any of
its material obligations under any such agreement or arrangement.

 



 

(k) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects, to the extent such Laws are applicable to them, with (i) U.S. anti-
money laundering and anti-terrorism financing Laws and the regulations
administered by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets
Control, and has adequate measures in place to comply with those Laws, (ii)
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, (iii) the Trading with the Enemy Act and
(iv) all comparable provisions of non-U.S. Laws.

 



 

(l) To the Companys knowledge, the Company and its Subsidiaries have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with respect to
information barriers between departments.

 



 

Section 3.18. _Risk Management Instruments_.

 



 

(a) All Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the account of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the Ordinary Course
of Business and in accordance, in all material respects, with prudent banking
practice and applicable Laws, rules, regulations and policies of any
Regulatory Authority and in accordance, in all material respects, with the
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
with counterparties believed at the time to be financially responsible and
able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and
to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of such Derivative
Transactions are valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and are in full force and effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys knowledge, all other
parties thereto have duly performed their material obligations under the
Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued and, to the Companys knowledge, there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.

Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed since November 2, 2009 and
prior to the date hereof (but excluding matters disclosed in the sections of
such reports entitled "Risk Factors" or "Information Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements") or on the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1. _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to own

is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger
Sub, respectively. True, complete and correct copies of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent (the " _Parent Charter_ "),
and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of Parent (the " _Parent By-Laws_ "), as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available to the Company.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (i) is duly incorporated or duly formed, as
applicable to each such Subsidiary, and validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has the requisite
corporate power and authority or other power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

 



 

(c) Merger Sub is a newly formed entity that will not have engaged in any
activities prior to the Effective Time, other than those related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.2. _Authorization; No Conflict or Violation_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Required
Parent Vote, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and

 



      
 

 



 

validly approved by the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub.
The Board of Directors of Parent has determined that this Agreement is
advisable and in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders and has
directed that the Parent Stock Issuance be submitted to Parents stockholders
for approval at a duly held meeting of such stockholders and has adopted a
resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for the Required Parent Vote, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly approved by Parent (being the sole stockholder) of Merger Sub, and no
other proceedings on the part of Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Merger Sub and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming, with
respect to this Agreement, due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company) constitutes the valid and binding obligations of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms (except as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception).

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by either Parent or
Merger Sub, nor the consummation by either Parent or Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (without notice or lapse of time or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or give
rise to any obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
payment under, or to the increased, additional, accelerated or guarantees
rights or entitlements of any Person under, or result in the creation of any
Liens upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries
under, any provisions of (i) the Parent Charter or the Parent By-Laws; (ii)
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub or the By-Laws of Merger Sub;
(iii) any Contract or Permit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party; (iv) any judgment, order, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Entity applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets; or (v) any applicable Law, except in the case
of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) for violations, defaults, terminations,

Stock, Parent Voting Debt or any other equity securities of Parent or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares

Disclosure Schedule, there are no contractual obligations of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of Parent or any equity security of Parent or its Subsidiaries
or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or
could be required to register shares of capital stock or other securities of
Parent under the Securities Act.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent has provided the Company with a true, complete and correct list of
the aggregate number of Parent Stock Options granted under any Parent Stock
Plan that were outstanding as of the Parent Capitalization Date and the
weighted average exercise price for the Parent Stock Options. Parent has

Equity Awards that are outstanding as of the Parent Capitalization Date and
except as set forth in _Section 4.4(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no
other subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of character calling for the purchase or issuance of, or the
payment of any amount based on, any shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent
Preferred Stock, Parent Voting Debt or other equity securities of Parent
(other than Parent Class B Common Stock) are outstanding as of the Parent

hereof, Parent has not (i) issued or repurchased any shares of Parent Common
Stock, Parent Class B Common Stock, Parent Preferred Stock, Parent Voting Debt

Parent Common Stock in connection with the exercise or vesting of Parent

(c) All grants of Parent Equity Awards and any other grants of stock options
or other equity interests were validly issued and properly approved by
Parents Board of Directors (and all required approvals by the stockholders of
Parent have been obtained) in accordance with all applicable Law and no such
grants involved any "backdating" or similar practices with respect to the
effective date of grant. The per share exercise price of each Parent Stock
Option was not less than the fair market value of the Parent Common Stock on
the applicable grant date (as determined in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(5)(iv)) and each such grant was properly accounted for
in all material respects in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
(including the related notes) of Parent and disclosed in Parents filings with
the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act and other applicable securities
Laws. No modifications have been made to any Parent Stock Options after the
applicable date of grant.

 



 

(d) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
ownership interests of each Subsidiary of Parent are owned by Parent, directly
or indirectly, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens, and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No
Subsidiary of Parent has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary. Except as set forth in _Section 4.4(d)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent does not have any Subsidiaries and does not
own any capital stock or other equity or voting securities or other rights
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for equity or voting
securities, or any other rights, interests or investments, in any other
Person.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Parent has no rights plan, "poison-pill" or other similar agreement or
arrangement or any anti-takeover provision in the Parent Organizational
Documents that is, or at the Effective Time shall be applicable to Parent,
Parent Common Stock, Parent Class B Common Stock, Parent Preferred Stock, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.5. _Parent SEC Reports_. Parent has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act on or after November 2, 2009 (the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). No
such Parent SEC Report, at the time filed or furnished (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not materially
misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports complied as to form in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. No executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

Section 4.6. _Parent Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are based upon, the
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring
year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied as to
form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the applicable
published rules and regulations of the SEC then in effect with respect

the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 (including any notes thereto)
or (ii) for liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since
December 31, 2009 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or
to become due) that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance that material information relating to Parent, including
its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those entities, and
(ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board
of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls over financial reporting. The disclosures pursuant to
_Section 4.6(c)(ii)_ were made in writing by management to Parents auditors

Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and its Subsidiaries
operations.

 



 

Section 6.2. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.2 (b)_, Parent agrees that,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the twelve
(12) month anniversary thereof, the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of the Surviving Company, Parent or
their respective Affiliates (the " _Affected Employees_ ") will continue to be
provided with (i) base salary or hourly wage rates that, on an individual-by-
individual basis, are no less favorable than those provided to such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are
the same as, or substantially comparable in the aggregate to, either (x) the
employee benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than benefits under
any stock option or other equity-based plans) or (y) the employee benefits
provided by Parent and its Affiliates to similarly situated employees during
such twelve (12) month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
any Affected Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or any of its
Affiliates without "cause" (other than due to death or disability) during the
twelve-month period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, severance benefits to such
Affected Employees, which shall be determined and payable in accordance with
the severance benefits under the policy in effect at the Company immediately
prior to the date hereof as set forth on _Section 6.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause service by the Affected
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities)
to be taken into account for purposes of eligibility to participate,
eligibility to commence benefits, determination

 



      
 

 



 

of benefits, vesting and, solely for purposes of severance and vacation
benefits, benefit accruals (except to the extent such treatment would result
in duplicative accrual of benefits for the same period of service) under the
Parent Benefit Plans in which the Affected Employees participate.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, with respect to the
Affected Employees entitled to participate in the Parent Benefit Plans subject
to United States Law (the " _U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), (i) cause to be waived
any pre-existing condition limitations and any waiting period limitations
under welfare benefit plans, policies or practices of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries participate
to the extent that such Affected Employee participated in the comparable
welfare plan of the Company immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) cause to
be credited any deductibles, co-payment amounts and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries and dependents during the
portion of the plan year prior to participation in the U.S. Benefit Plans
provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, effective not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) not later than the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries any right to
continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific
employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan. Further, this
Section 6.2 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of
the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.2, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.2.

 



 

Section 6.3. _Indemnification Continuation_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 6.3_, (i) "Indemnified Person" shall mean
any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of the Company or who was serving at the request of the
Company as an officer or director of another corporation, joint venture or
other enterprise, and can provide evidence thereof to Parent reasonably
acceptable to Parent and (ii) "Proceeding" shall mean any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether or not such claim, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
jointly and severally shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless against any costs
or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons (A) to the fullest extent
such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement

 



      
 

 



 

of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Company Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date hereof with any Indemnified Persons and (B) without
limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii)
honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Company Organizational Documents immediately prior
to the Effective Time and ensure that the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company Organizational
Documents. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Person pursuant to
this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at
any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such
Indemnified Person as provided herein except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company
shall, maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons (" _D andO Insurance_") (provided that the
Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to the Indemnified Persons); provided, however, that in no event
shall the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this _Section
6.3(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Company would be required
to expend more than 250% of current annual premiums, the Surviving Company
shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of
annual premiums equal to 250% of current annual premiums. The Company may,
with the prior written consent of Parent, prior to the Effective Time purchase
a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time that were committed by such Indemnified Persons in their
capacity as such; provided that in no event shall the cost of such policy
exceed the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased, Parent
and the Surviving Company shall have no further obligations under this
_Section 6.3(c)_.

 



 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.3_ shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section
6.3_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger for a period of six (6)
years and are expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons
and their respective heirs and representatives; provided, however, that in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in _Section 6.3_
are asserted or made within such six (6) year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims. If Parent and/or Surviving Company, or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to
the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent and/or Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations of Parent and Surviving Company set forth in this
_Section 6.3_.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.4. _Parent Board of Directors_. Parent agrees to take all action
necessary (including increasing the number of directors that constitute
Parents Board of Directors) to elect each of George M.L. LaBranche, IV and
Katherine Elizabeth Dietze as a director of Parent effective as of, and
subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Notice of Breach_. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, Parent shall promptly give written notice
with particularity upon having knowledge of any matter that may constitute a
breach by Parent of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 



 

Section 7.1. _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4;
Stockholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) days after
the execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
preparing and cause to be filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement, and
Parent shall prepare, together with the Company, and file with the SEC the
Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto. Parent and the Company shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Form S-4 to become effective
under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable and to keep
the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The
Joint Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger and, with respect to the Board of Directors of Parent, in favor
of approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger for
purposes of the rules of Nasdaq (the " _Parent Stock Issuance_ "), except to
the extent the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent such action is permitted by
_Section 7.5_ or _Section 7.6_. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 becomes
effective. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide copies,
consult with each other and prepare written responses with respect to any
written comments received from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 and advise one another of any oral comments
received from the SEC. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement shall, at
the time of each of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, comply as to form in all material respects with the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
by the SEC thereunder.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky" Laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each of Parent and the Company will advise the other,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the

 



      
 

 



 

issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. No amendment or supplement to
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 shall be filed without the approval
of both Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided that, with respect to documents filed by a party
which are incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information
relating to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of
operations. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and
Parent.

 



 

(c) The Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be duly called
and held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Vote. Nothing in
this _Section 7.1_ shall be deemed to prevent the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company from taking any action they are permitted or required
to take under, and in compliance with, _Section 7.5_. In connection with such
meeting, the Company will (i) subject to _Section 7.5_, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Required Company Vote and (ii) otherwise comply
with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. The information
supplied or to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation in the Form S-4 shall not at the time the Form S-4 is declared
effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein not misleading. The information supplied or to
be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion in the Joint Proxy
Statement, which shall be included in the Form S-4, shall not, on the date(s)
the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company
and the stockholders of Parent, respectively, or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, or at
the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and
held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Required Parent Vote. Nothing in
this _Section 7.1_ shall be deemed to prevent Parent or the Board of
Directors of Parent from taking any action they are permitted or required to
take under, and in compliance with, _Section 7.6_. In connection with such
meeting, Parent will (i) subject to _Section 7.6_, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Required Parent Vote and (ii) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting. The information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation in the Form
S-4

 



      
 

 



 

shall not at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by Parent
specifically for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement, which shall be
included in the Form S-4, shall not, on the date(s) the Joint Proxy Statement
is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of
Parent, respectively, or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or
the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, or at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 



 

Section 7.2. _Access to Information_.

 



 

Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) afford to Parent and its representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities and to all books
and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and its representatives,
consistent with its legal obligations, all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request,
including, on a daily basis, all financial and trading records, prime
brokerage account statements and risk reports and assessments; provided,
however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that, in the Companys reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have
used all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such access, (ii) any Law or treaty of any Governmental Entity
applicable to the Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to preclude
Parent and its representatives from gaining access to any properties or
information or (iii) providing such access would jeopardize the protection of
attorney-client privilege. Parent will hold any such information that is non-
public in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 28, 2010
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent.

 



 

Section 7.3. _HSR Act and Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, clearances
and authorizations of all third parties, Governmental Entities and Regulatory
Agencies that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including the Company
Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the Parent Requisite Regulatory Approvals
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals, clearances and authorizations of all such third parties,
Governmental Entities or Regulatory Agencies. The Company and Parent and their
respective counsel shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the
information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case

 



      
 

 



 

may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) promptly inform each other of any oral or written
communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given
to, any Governmental Entity, and (iii) furnish each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or
its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the
Merger. Except as expressly prohibited by any Governmental Entity, the Company
and Parent shall provide the other party and its counsel with reasonable
advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any discussion,
telephone call or meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with this Agreement or
the Merger, and to participate in the preparation for such discussion,
telephone call or meeting. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this _Section 7.3(a)_ as "Outside Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the disclosing party or
its legal counsel. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the parties
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall not be required to agree to any terms, conditions or
modifications (including having to cease, sell or otherwise dispose of any
assets or business or to hold any such assets or business separate) with
respect to obtaining any consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations
or orders in connection with the Merger or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would result in, or would
reasonably be likely to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the business or operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the other all information
(including audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial and
business information) concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, employees and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be prohibited
by Law.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent, approval
or clearance of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or
Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be

 



      
 

 



 

obtained or that the receipt of any such consent, approval or clearance may be
materially delayed.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Reorganization_.

 



 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger and the Second Step Merger, taken
together, qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and will report it as such for federal, state and local income tax
purposes. None of the parties will knowingly take any action or fail to take
any action, which action or failure to act would cause the Merger and the
Second Step Merger, taken together, to fail to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide, in connection with the Closing and at such other times as may
reasonably be requested by counsel, the officers certificates and to obtain
the opinions referred to in _Section 8.2(c)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_ hereto,
respectively.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.5_, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives or other intermediaries), nor
shall (directly or indirectly) the Company authorize any of its or their
Affiliates, officers, directors, representatives or other intermediaries or
Subsidiaries to: (i) solicit, initiate, take any action to knowingly
facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from
any Person (other than Parent) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal,
or agree to or endorse any Company Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into any
agreement to (x) facilitate or consummate any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(y) approve or endorse any Company Acquisition Proposal or (z) in connection
with any Company Acquisition Proposal, require it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger; (iii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or
furnish or provide to any Person any non-public information with respect to
its business, properties or assets in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal; or (iv)
agree to resolve or take any of the actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of this sentence. The Company shall immediately cease, and direct its
representatives and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The Company shall promptly
inform its representatives of the Companys obligations under this _Section
7.5_. Any violation of this _Section 7.5_ by any representative of the
Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
7.5_ by the Company. For purposes of this _Section 7.5_, the term "Person"
means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as defined in _Section
13(d)_ of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or
any Subsidiaries of Parent.

 



 

" _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal for a merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to

 



      
 

 



 

acquire, directly or indirectly, securities representing more than 15% of the
voting power of the Company or more than 15% of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through representatives or other intermediaries, may,
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any Company
Acquisition Proposal, so long as any such compliance rejects any Company
Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, except to the extent
such action is permitted by _Section 7.5(c)_, or issue a "stop, look and
listen" statement, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person
(and its representatives and intermediaries) that has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Company Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or arising out of
a material breach of _Section 7.5(a)_, and/or (iii) furnish to any Person who
makes a Company Acquisition Proposal information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality provisions that are substantially similar to, and no less
favorable to, the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and to the extent nonpublic information that has not been made
available to Parent is made available to such Person, the Company shall
furnish such nonpublic information to Parent prior to the time it is provided
to such Person; provided that the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
permitted to take an action described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii)
if, and only if, prior to taking such particular action, the Board of
Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal.

 



 

" _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal (on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party that
is not affiliated with the Company to enter into any transaction involving a
Company Acquisition Proposal (if consummated) that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor) (i) to be more
favorable to the Companys stockholders than this Agreement and the Merger,
taking into account all terms and conditions of such transaction (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provision and financial terms, the
anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of such
transaction, including the prospects for obtaining regulatory approvals and
financing, and any third party approvals) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be
completed, except that the reference to "15%" in the definition of "Company
Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%". Reference to
"this Agreement" and "the Merger" in this paragraph shall be deemed to include
any proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger that are
agreed to by Parent after it receives written notice from the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.5(c)_ or _(d)_ of the existence of, the identity of the Person
making, and the terms and conditions of, any Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.5_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Companys Board of
Directors may withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger (a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") in response to (i) a Company Intervening
Event, if and only if, the Companys Board of Directors has

 



      
 

 



 

determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law or (ii) subject to compliance with _Section 7.5(e)_, a Company
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result
from or arise out of a breach of _Section 7.5(a)_, if the Companys Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel that such proposal is a Company Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The Companys Board of Directors shall not cause or authorize the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint
venture agreement or other agreement related to any Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with _Section
7.5(b)_) (each a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") and the Company shall
not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement, unless the Companys Board of Directors has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal is a Company Superior
Proposal and the Company complies with _Section 7.5(e)_ and terminates this
Agreement in compliance with _Section 9.1(i)_, including concurrently paying
to Parent the Termination Fee as described in _Section 9.1(i)_.

 



 

(e) Prior to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section
7.5(c)(ii)_ or entering into any Company Acquisition Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.5(d)_, the Company shall have given Parent five (5) Business Days
written notice (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
amount or form of consideration of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period) advising Parent
that the Companys Board of Directors intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or that the Company intends to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement, specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Company Acquisition Proposal and that the Company shall, during any such
period, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent requested by

Section 7.6. _Parent Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.6_, none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives or other intermediaries), nor
shall (directly or indirectly) Parent authorize any of its or their
Affiliates, officers, directors, representatives or other intermediaries or

facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from
any Person (other than the Company) relating to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, or agree to or endorse any Parent Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter
into any agreement to (x) facilitate or consummate any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (y) approve or endorse any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (z) in
connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal, require it to abandon,

any discussions or negotiations in connection with any Parent Acquisition

(iii) of this sentence. Parent shall immediately cease, and direct its
representatives and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Parent shall promptly inform
its representatives of Parents obligations under this _Section 7.6_. Any
violation of this _Section 7.6_ by any representative of Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.6_ by Parent.
For purposes of this _Section 7.6_, the term "Person" means any person,
corporation, entity or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, other than, with respect to Parent, the Company or any Subsidiaries of
the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

" _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal for a merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction involving Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly,
securities representing more than 35% of the voting power of Parent or more
than 35% of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other
than the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Parent, directly
or indirectly through representatives or other intermediaries, may, prior to
Parent Stockholders Meeting, (i) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, so long as any such compliance rejects any Parent Acquisition
Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, except to the extent such action is
permitted by _Section 7.6(c)_, or issue a "stop, look and listen" statement,
(ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person (and its
representatives and intermediaries) that has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Parent Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or arising out of a
material breach of _Section 7.6(a)_, and/or (iii) furnish to any Person who
makes a Parent Acquisition Proposal information relating to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with confidentiality
provisions that are substantially similar to, and no less favorable to, Parent
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent
nonpublic information that has not been made available to the Company is made
available to such Person, Parent shall furnish such nonpublic information to
the Company prior to the time it is provided to such Person; provided that the
Board of Directors of Parent shall be permitted to take an action described in
the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) if, and only if, prior to taking such
particular action, the Board of Directors of Parent has reasonably determined
in good faith that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal.

 



 

" _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal (on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party that
is not affiliated with Parent to enter into any transaction involving a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (if consummated) that the Board of Directors of Parent
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with Parents
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to be more favorable to Parents
stockholders than this Agreement and the Merger, taking into account all terms
and conditions of such transaction (including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provision and financial terms, the anticipated timing,
conditions and prospects for completion of such transaction, including the
prospects for obtaining regulatory approvals and financing, and any third
party approvals).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.6_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Required Parent Vote, Parents Board of
Directors may withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Company)
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the Parent
Stock Issuance (a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") in response to
(i) a Parent Intervening Event, if and only if, Parents Board of Directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Parents stockholders under
applicable Law or (ii) subject to compliance with _Section 7.6(d)_, a

 



      
 

 



 

Parent Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise
result from or arise out of a breach of _Section 7.6(a)_, if Parents Board
of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such proposal is a Parent
Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Parents stockholders under
applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Prior to any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section
7.6(c)(ii)_, Parent shall have given the Company three (3) Business Days
written notice advising the Company that Parents Board of Directors intends
to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, specifying the material terms
and conditions of the Parent Acquisition Proposal and that Parent shall,
during such three (3) Business Day period, negotiate in good faith with the
Company (to the extent recommended by the Company) to make such adjustments to
the Merger Consideration and other terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Parent Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Parent
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Parent Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any request for nonpublic information with respect to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, (iii) any inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiation with
respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, and (iv) the material terms and
conditions of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal, request for information,
inquiry, proposal, discussion or negotiation and the identity of the Person

addition, Parent shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after the
receipt thereof, provide to the Company copies of any written documentation
material to understanding such Parent Acquisition Proposal, request for
information, inquiry, proposal, discussion or negotiation (" _Other Parent
Acquisition Documentation_ ") which is received by Parent from the Person (or
from any representatives or agents of such Person) making such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry or proposal or with
whom such discussions or negotiations are taking place. Parent shall not, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify
any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and Parent shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status and material details
(including any amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal or request for information and keep the Company
reasonably informed as to the material details of any information requested of
or provided by Parent and as to the material details of all discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such Parent Acquisition Proposal, request for
information, inquiry or proposal and shall provide to the Company within one
(1) Business Day after receipt thereof all copies of any additional Other
Parent Acquisition Documentation received by Parent from the Person (or from
any representatives or agents of such Person) making such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, request for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom such
discussions or negotiations are taking place. Parent shall not take any action

later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its good faith calculation of the

respect to the Companys calculations. The Company shall consult with Parent
regarding the preparation of such statement.

 



 

Section 7.8. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall keep each
other informed of, and cooperate with one another in connection with, any
stockholder litigation or claim against it and/or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that no settlement in connection with such
stockholder litigation shall be agreed to without the other partys prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



 

Section 7.9. _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final
discretion of the disclosing party.

 



 

Section 7.10. _No Shareholder Rights Plan_. From the date hereof through the
earlier of termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company

Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"

be followed by the words "without limitation." Words defined in the singular
have the parallel meaning in the plural and vice versa. Words of one gender
shall be construed to apply to each gender and the neutral gender. The term
"party" refers to a party to this Agreement and the term "parties" refers to
the parties to this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or
construed to require any person to take any action, or fail to take any
action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. The parties hereto
acknowledge that each party hereto has reviewed, and has had an opportunity to
have its counsel review, this Agreement and that any rule of construction to
the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party,
or any similar rule operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not
be applicable to the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive

agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument

assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.
