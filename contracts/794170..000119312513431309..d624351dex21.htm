PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey, and deliver the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase
the Shares from Seller (the " _Transaction_ "), for an aggregate purchase
price equal to One Billion, Five Hundred and Sixty-Six Million, Seven Hundred
and Four Thousand, Two Hundred and Eighty-Seven Dollars ($1,566,704,287),
__plus__ an amount equal to the Balance Sheet Date Net Cash (the " _Purchase
Price_ "). The Purchase Price shall be subject to further adjustment as
provided in _Section 2.4_.

Section 2.2 _Earnest Money Deposit_. To induce Seller to enter into this
Agreement and to terminate discussions with other parties with respect to the
sale of the Shares, Buyer is delivering to Escrow Agent for the benefit of
Seller, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, a deposit
in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Deposit_ "), which Deposit shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account
in Escrow Agents name at a nationally-recognized banking
institution designated by Seller. Any interest earned on the Deposit from the
date the same is so deposited by Buyer shall be deemed part of the Deposit for
all purposes hereunder and shall be treated as income of Buyer for applicable
income tax purposes. The Deposit shall become non-refundable to Buyer upon
execution of this Agreement, unless (i) Buyer and Seller terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(a)_, (ii) Buyer terminates this
Agreement in accordance with  _Section 9.1(d)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_, (iii)
Seller or Buyer terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(b)_
(except if Buyer is the terminating party and Buyers termination right
under 

 



11   _Section 9.1(b)_ arises out of facts that would constitute a breach of
Buyers representations, warranties or covenants herein) or (iv) Seller or
Buyer terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(c)_ because
no Closing occurs on or prior to the Outside Date due to a condition in
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ not having been met or waived (except (A) if
the condition in _Section 7.1(a)_ is not met because of an order or
injunction described therein being in effect in any Action commenced by Buyer
or any of its Representatives or (B) if any condition in _Section 7.1_ or 
_Section 7.2_ is not met as of a result of Buyers breach of its
representations and warranties in _Article IV_ or any of its obligations under
this Agreement sufficient to permit termination of this Agreement by Seller
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e))._ If Buyer or Seller (as applicable) terminates
this Agreement in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Deposit
(together with any interest) shall be promptly returned by Escrow Agent to
Buyer. If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason, the Deposit
shall be promptly paid over by Escrow Agent to Seller. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth herein, if the Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be
applied against the Purchase Price on the Closing Date.

Section 2.3 _Closing_.

 

(a) The consummation of the Transaction (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at
10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 333
S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles, California, on the second Business Day following
the satisfaction, or to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in _Article VII_
(other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the
Closing or on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction on, or to the

Seller and Buyer mutually may agree in writing. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the
Closing or on the Closing Date), then the Closing shall occur instead on the
date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the

as may be specified by Buyer on no less than two (2) Business Days prior
notice to Seller and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period, subject in
each case to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ as of the date determined in accordance with the foregoing
clause (a) or (b), or such other time or on such other date as Seller and
Buyer mutually may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing takes place
is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

_Article VII_ , Seller and Buyer shall make, and Seller shall cause the

Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer with a preliminary estimated pro forma consolidated balance
sheet and income statement of the Acquired Entities as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and for the period from the Balance Sheet Date
through the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Financial Statements_ "),
prepared in accordance with the methodology and accounting principles set
forth on _Exhibit H_ (the " _Agreed Principles_ "), which shall set forth
Sellers good faith estimate of the Distributions, Contributions and Non-
Acquired Entity Expenditures. The Purchase Price shall be increased or
decreased, as the case may be, by the estimated Purchase Price Adjustment as
reflected by the Estimated Closing Financial Statements (such estimated
Purchase Price Adjustment being referred to as " _Seller s Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment_").

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Seller its proposed consolidated balance sheet and income statement of the
Acquired Entities as of

 



14  the close of business on the Closing Date and for the period from the
Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date in accordance with the Agreed
Principles (" _Buyer s Proposed Closing Financial Statements_") and setting
forth Buyers proposed amounts of the Distributions, Contributions, Non-
Acquired Entity Expenditures and the resulting proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment (" _Buyer s Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment_"). If Buyer fails
to make delivery of Buyers Proposed Closing Financial Statements on a timely
basis, the Estimated Closing Financial Statements shall become final and
binding, and Sellers Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment shall become the
Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) During the thirty (30) day period following Sellers receipt of Buyers
Proposed Closing Financial Statements, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Seller with access to the working papers of Buyer relating
to Buyers Proposed Closing Financial Statements, and Buyer shall cooperate
with Seller to provide Seller with any other information used in preparing
Buyers Proposed Closing Financial Statements reasonably requested by Seller.
Buyers Proposed Closing Financial Statements shall become final and binding,
and Buyers Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment shall become the Purchase Price
Adjustment, on the 31st day following delivery thereof, unless prior to the
end of such period Seller delivers to Buyer written notice of its
disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying in reasonable detail
those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees and the basis therefor. If
any such Notice of Disagreement shall have been duly delivered by Seller,
both Seller and Buyer shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such
delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amount of Distributions, Contributions, Non-Acquired Entity Expenditures and
resulting Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(ii) If during such period, Seller and Buyer are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter engage Deloitte LLP or such other
independent accounting firm as they may mutually agree upon (as the case may
be, the " _Independent Accountant_ ") to review this Agreement and the
disputed items or amounts for the sole purpose of determining the amount
of Distributions, Contributions, Non-Acquired Business Expenditures and the
resulting Purchase Price Adjustment. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that it
shall not engage, or agree or commit to engage, until the Purchase Price
Adjustment has been finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_,
the Independent Accountant to perform any services other than as the
Independent Accountant pursuant hereto. Each party agrees to execute, if
requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant and promptly
provide all documents and information reasonably requested by the Independent
Accountant. In making its determination, the Independent Accountant shall
consider only those items or amounts in Buyers proposed Distributions,
Contributions and Non-Acquired Entity Expenditures as to which Seller has
disagreed in its Notice of Disagreement. The Independent Accountant shall
deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Independent

 



15  Accountant), a report setting forth such determination. Such report and
Independent Accountants determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment shall
be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and neither Buyer nor Seller
shall seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than to
enforce such report. Judgment may be entered to enforce such report in any
court of competent jurisdiction. If the Independent Accountants
determination results in a Purchase Price Adjustment that exceeds Buyers
Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment (which for purposes of clarity, includes
the case of a negative Purchase Price Adjustment that, expressed as
an absolute value, is less than the absolute value of a negative Buyers
Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment), the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be paid by Buyer. If the Independent Accountants
determination results in a Purchase Price Adjustment that equals or is less
than Buyers Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment, the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Seller.

 

(iii) Buyer, Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives to, cooperate in the calculation of the Purchase Price
Adjustment and in the conduct of the review referred to in this _Section
2.4(b)_, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel (without, however, requiring the waiver of
any legal privilege).

(iv) The final purchase price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") shall equal the
Purchase Price as adjusted by the Purchase Price Adjustment, __less__ an
amount equal to the aggregate sum of the so-called "success bonuses"
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the employer paid portion of any
applicable payroll Taxes with respect to such bonuses) paid by Buyer, an
Acquired Entity or any Affiliate of Buyer to Continuing Employees within
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date under the retention letters listed
on _Schedule 3.16(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

(c) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) If the Closing Date Purchase Price is in excess of the Final Purchase
Price, Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days
after the Purchase Price Adjustment has been determined as hereinabove
provided) pay to Buyer the amount of such excess by wire transfer of United
States dollars in immediately available funds to such account or accounts
as may be designated in writing by Buyer; or

(ii) If the Closing Date Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after
the Purchase Price Adjustment has been agreed upon or determined as
hereinabove provided) pay to Seller the amount of such deficiency by wire
transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as may be designated in writing by Seller.

(d) Amounts due by Buyer or Seller under this _Section 2.4_ shall not be
subject to the limitations on indemnification in _Article VIII_ or used in any
calculation of any such limitations.

 



16 Section 2.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Final Purchase Price (plus any
liabilities of the Acquired Entities to the extent treated as purchase price
for federal income tax purposes) (the " _Tax Purchase Price_ ") shall be
allocated among the assets of the Acquired Entities in accordance with the
principles set forth on _Exhibit I_ (the " _Allocation Exhibit_ ") for
federal and applicable state income tax purposes. Each party agrees to (i) be
bound by the Allocation Exhibit for Tax purposes, (ii) act in strict
accordance with the Allocation Exhibit in the preparation and filing of all
Returns, (iii) timely file an Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 reflecting
the Allocation Exhibit for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and
to make any timely comparable filings required by applicable state or local
Law and (iv) not take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Exhibit
for any Tax purpose, except in each case as required by a final determination
(as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code).

Section 2.6 _Confirmatory Due Diligence_. During the period commencing as of
the date of this Agreement and ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the
thirtieth (30th) day thereafter (the " _Termination Time_ "), Seller and Buyer
shall use their best efforts to schedule and attend meetings with the head or
assistant head of planning of each of the agencies listed on _Schedule 2.6_
for the sole purpose of allowing Buyer the opportunity to discuss with each
such head or assistant head of planning the status of the Core Development
Entitlements for the Owned Real Property located in said jurisdictions.
Sellers representatives shall have the right to attend any and all such
meetings. If, and only if, during the course of such meetings Buyer first
learns of any previously undisclosed judgment, order, decree, ordinance,
regulation, moratorium or other Action, either pending or threatened in
writing, by or before a Governmental Authority that would restrict the
development of the Owned Real Property in accordance with the Core
Development Entitlements in a manner that would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, Buyer
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and receive the return of
the Deposit if it provides written notice to Seller of such election on or
prior to the Termination Time. Buyer acknowledges that it has reviewed the
Core Development Entitlements, the Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure
Schedules, and, subject to the cut-off date referred to in _Section 10.3_,
all information, documents and other materials included in or provided through
the Dataroom, and that the contents thereof and all matters set forth therein
shall be deemed to have been disclosed to Buyer for purposes of the preceding
sentence.

Section 2.7 _Designation of Acquired Entities as Transferees of Minority
Interests_. Each Minority Partner Purchase Agreement grants Seller the right
to designate Persons to which the applicable Minority Partner has agreed it
will convey the minority partnership or limited liability company
interest described therein (each a " _Minority Interest_ "). Seller shall (a)
(i) prior to the Closing, cause the Company to form a corporation (the "
_Liberty Minority Corporate Subsidiary_ "), which shall be an Acquired
Entity, to take title to a 0.1% interest in the Companys interest in Porter
Ranch Development Co., and (ii) at the Closing, designate a newly formed
limited liability company, which shall be an Acquired Entity, to take title
to such portion of the Minority Interest currently owned by Liberty Building
Company and thus have such designee acquire such Minority Interest

 



17  directly from Liberty Building Company, and (b) at the Closing, designate a
newly formed limited liability company, and a newly formed corporation (the "
_FKC Minority Corporate Subsidiary_ ," and together with the Liberty Minority
Corporate Subsidiary, the " _Corporate Subsidiaries_ "), each of which shall
be an Acquired Entity, to take title to such portion of the Minority
Interests currently owned by FKC, LLC as Buyer may specify in writing at
least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing and thus have such designees
acquire such Minority Interest directly from FKC, LLC. Seller shall directly
pay the purchase price for the Minority Interests and fulfill its other
obligations under the Minority Partner Purchase Agreements. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 9.1 of each Minority Partner Purchase Agreement
and Section 11.2 of such agreement with Liberty Building Company (which
sections Seller hereby agrees not to amend or modify or give its consent to
amend or modify without the prior written consent of Buyer), Buyer
acknowledges that notwithstanding such direct conveyance (i) Buyer has
no contractual or legal rights under and shall not be deemed an intended or
incidental beneficiary of any Minority Partner Purchase Agreement, (ii) such
conveyance or assignment creates no privity between Buyer and any Minority

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Each of the Acquired Entities is in compliance with and is not in default
under or in violation of any applicable Law and none of Seller, its
Subsidiaries or, to Sellers knowledge, any of its other Affiliates has

22 Section 3.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Schedule 3.9_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of (i) each
employment, severance, bonus, profit sharing, compensation, termination,
retention, deferred compensation, incentive, equity or equity-based
compensation, or change in control, agreement, plan, program or policy
(including individual contracts), (ii) each Pension Plan, including any
plan that is a Multiemployer Plan and (iii) each other material benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement, including each material "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and each post-
employment health, medical, life insurance or other welfare benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA, in each case,
entered into, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Acquired Entities
or any of their ERISA Affiliates for the benefit or welfare of any
Participant and, solely in the case of clause (i), for the benefit of any
contractor or consultant, or with respect to which any Acquired Entity has any
actual or contingent liability (such plans, agreements and arrangements,
collectively the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). Each of the Company Benefit
Plans is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws,
including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ ") and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").
The Internal Revenue Service has determined that each Company Benefit Plan
that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code is
so qualified and, to the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred after the
date of such determination that would materially and adversely affect such
determination. No condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the
Acquired Entities to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV of ERISA
or to a civil penalty under Section 502(j) of ERISA or liability under Section
4069 of ERISA or Sections 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code, or to Controlled
Group Liability, or the loss of a federal tax deduction under Section 280G of
the Code. To the knowledge of Seller, there are no pending or threatened
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against
any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto that would
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Acquired
Entities. No Company Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan, nor has the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries contributed to a Multiemployer Plan for the past
six years.

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, Seller has delivered or made
available to Buyer in the Dataroom complete and accurate copies of (i) such
Company Benefit Plan, including any amendment thereto (or, in the case of any
unwritten Company Benefit Plan, a written description thereof), (ii) each
trust, insurance, annuity or other funding Contract related thereto, and (iii)
the most recent summary plan description and any summary of material
modifications (if any) prepared for each Company Benefit Plan.

 

(c) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the
stockholder approval or the consummation of the Transaction or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with any
other event, including any termination of employment) will (i) entitle any
Participant, contractor or consultant to any material compensation or benefit
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or

 



23  vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any material compensation or
benefits or trigger any other material obligation under any Company Benefit
Plan other than the Employee Parachute Payments. No amount or other
entitlement that could be received as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including
any termination of employment) by any "disqualified individual" (as defined
under Section 280G of the Code) (a " _Disqualified Individual_ ") with respect
to the Acquired Entities would reasonably be expected to constitute an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
Participant is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by
reason of any tax being imposed on such person, including any tax required by
Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 

(d) None of the Business Employees is a member of or represented by any (i)
labor union, works council or similar organization or (ii) collective
bargaining agreement, in each case with respect to such Business Employees
employment by the Acquired Entities and the Acquired Entities do not have any
obligation with respect to any such organization. Each of the Acquired
Entities is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws
and orders with respect to labor relations, employment and employment
practices, occupational safety and health standards, payment of wages or other
compensation, classification of workers, immigration, visa or work status.

the Owned Real Property, except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(a)_ , (i) one
or more of the Acquired Entities has good and valid title to such Owned Real

24  Property affected thereby, (iii) neither Seller nor any Acquired Entity has

of the Owned Real Property affected thereby, (iv) none of the Owned Real
Property has been leased, and (v) none of the Owned Real Property has been

thereby.

 

(b) _Schedule 3.10(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
complete list of each material lease, sublease or license (the " _Real

material operations of the Acquired Entities are conducted (the " _Leased
Real Property_ "), specifying in the case of each of the Real Property Leases,
the date thereof, the current parties thereto, the dates of any amendments as
well as the address or location and use thereof. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, (i) each Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full
force and effect, (ii) no uncured default of a material nature on the part
of any Acquired Entity or, to the knowledge of Seller, the landlord or other

event has occurred and no condition exists that, with notice or lapse of

authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Buyer is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially
impair the ability of Buyer to consummate the Transaction.

Section 4.2 _Authority_. Buyer has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to be delivered at
Closing by Buyer and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been, and as of the
Closing the Ancillary Agreements will have been, duly executed and delivered
by Buyer. Assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery by Seller, this
Agreement constitutes, and each of the Ancillary Agreements when executed and
delivered will constitute, a valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms.

Section 4.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and
each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer will be a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and
will not:

 

(i) conflict with or violate the Organizational Documents of Buyer;

 

(ii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Buyer or by which any
property or asset of Buyer is bound or affected; or

 

(iii) result in any breach of, constitute a default under, result in a
termination, cancellation or acceleration under, or result in the creation or
the imposition of a Lien under (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute or result in the foregoing), or require any consent
of any Person pursuant to any Contract to which Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their assets or properties are
bound;

 



30  subject, in the case of clause (ii), to compliance with and filings under
the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR Act_ "),
and except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that (A) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer or prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
performance by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, or (B) arise as a result of any facts or circumstances specifically
relating to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 4.4 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders, or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Buyer.

 

Section 4.5 _Investment Intent; Ability to Bear Risk_. Buyer is acquiring the
Shares solely for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or
for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer
understands that the Shares may not be resold except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless
an exemption therefrom is available. Buyer is familiar with the real estate
development business generally and the businesses in which the Acquired
Entities conduct their operations specifically, and has the requisite business
and financial knowledge and experience to evaluate the merits and risks of
its acquisition of the Shares.

Section 4.6 _Acknowledgement by Buyer_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller, the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them, has made
any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the condition,
merchantability, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose of any of
the assets owned or used by the Acquired Entities, or made any representation
or warranty regarding the Acquired Entities or any other matter relating to
the Acquired Entities (including the Financial Statements and the Acquired
Properties), except as expressly stated in this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Schedules) or the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate
delivered hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, except as set forth in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any certificate delivered
hereunder, Buyer agrees that (i) neither Seller, the Company, nor their
respective Subsidiaries, nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them,
will have any liability to Buyer resulting from the distribution or
availability to Buyer, its Affiliates, Representatives, financing sources,
or others, or any such persons use, of information provided in anticipation
of entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including that
certain Offering Memorandum dated June 27, 2013 (the " _Offering Memorandum_
"), and information, documents and other materials included in the Dataroom or
presentations by officers and employees of Seller, the Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or in any other form and (ii) no individual
named in the Offering Memorandum or documents posted to the Dataroom shall
have any liability to Buyer resulting from or related to such individual being
a source of the knowledge of Seller and the Company for the purposes
of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

 



31 (b) Buyer acknowledges that all forward-looking information received from or
made available by or on behalf of Seller, including projected statements of
revenues, income, cash flow, and other business and financial condition and
results in the Offering Memorandum, the Dataroom, or elsewhere, contain
numerous uncertainties inherent in attempting to make estimates, projections
and other forecasts, are not warranties of future performance or financial
results, and involve numerous assumptions about risks and events that are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Seller, the
Company, their respective Subsidiaries, their financial advisers, and other
agents. Buyer further acknowledges that it is familiar with such uncertainties
and assumptions, that it takes full responsibility for making its own
independent evaluation of possible future revenues, income, cash flow, and
other business and financial condition and results, that it understands and
has taken into account the likelihood that actual future results will differ,
perhaps materially, from those reflected in any such forward-looking
statements, and that, except as set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder, Buyer shall have no claim
against Seller, its Affiliates or its Representatives with respect to any
such forward-looking information.

Section 4.7 _Sufficient Funds_. Buyer possesses liquid capital, or
written commitments therefor from viable financing sources, subject only to
the conditions set forth on _Schedule 4.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules,
sufficient to enable Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and timely perform all of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. A copy of the commitment or commitments
is included in _Schedule 4.7(b)_ (the " _Debt Financing Commitment Letter_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree that it shall not be a condition to the obligations of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby that Buyer have
sufficient funds for payment of the Purchase Price.

such breach, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

 

Section 5.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consents_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer will each use, and before and after the Closing,
respectively, will each cause the Acquired Entities to use,
their commercially reasonable

 



35  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including (i) the obtaining in
the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable of all necessary actions,
waivers, consents, and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain an Approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
Action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties except as
otherwise contemplated by _Section 5.4(c)_ in the case of Divestiture
Consents, (iii) the obtaining of the Environmental Policy and (iv)
the execution and delivery of such additional instruments and documents as
either party may reasonably request to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ , that in connection
with obtaining the consent of any Person other than a Governmental Authority,
Buyer shall not be required to make or agree to make any payment or accept any
material conditions or obligations, including amendments to existing
conditions and obligations.

 

(b) Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to
the matters that are the subject of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
communication by such party to any Governmental Authority to the extent
reasonably practicable and permitted by Law. No party to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transaction shall be
construed as requiring Seller or any Acquired Entity to assign any Excluded
Asset that by its terms or by Law is nonassignable without the consent of a
third party or a Governmental Authority or is subject to cancellation or
acceleration by a third party in the event of an assignment ("
_Nonassignable Excluded Assets_ ") unless and until such consents shall have
been obtained. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such consents prior to the Closing Date. In the event any Divestiture Release,
Divestiture Consent or any other license, Permit, consent, approval,
authorization, qualification or order required to be obtained in connection
with the Divestitures has not been obtained prior to the Closing

 



36  Date, Seller shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such release, license, Permit, consent, approval, authorization,
qualification or order until it is obtained and consummate the applicable
Divestiture at the earliest practicable date. In the event that any
Nonassignable Excluded Asset has not been divested as of the date that is six
(6) months after the Closing Date, beginning on the six (6) month anniversary
of the Closing Date and continuing until all such Nonassignable Excluded
Assets have been divested, Seller shall pay Buyer a fee equal to 10.0% _per
annum_ of the aggregate Liability Exposure of such Nonassignable
Excluded Assets (calculated based on the Liability Exposure of such
Nonassignable Excluded Assets that have not been divested on the last day of
each quarter), which shall be paid quarterly in arrears for the preceding
quarter. Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the end of each applicable
quarter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a reasonably detailed
invoice setting forth such fee. Seller shall pay to Buyer the aggregate amount
owed within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt of such invoice. Buyer
and the Acquired Entities, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other, will
cooperate in any lawful and economically feasible arrangement to provide that
Seller shall receive the interest in the benefits, and assume the costs and
other liabilities, of any Nonassignable Excluded Assets that have not been
divested as of the Closing Date until the applicable Divestiture is completed.
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, also take or cause to
be taken at Sellers expense such actions in Buyer or its Affiliates name or
otherwise as Seller may reasonably request so as to provide Seller with the
benefits of the Nonassignable Excluded Assets and to effect collection of
money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under the
Nonassignable Excluded Assets, and Buyer or the applicable Subsidiary shall
promptly pay over to Seller all money or other consideration received by it in
respect to all Nonassignable Excluded Assets. With respect to any
Nonassignable Excluded Asset that has not been divested as of the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with all information and reasonable
assistance as may be reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to Buyers
compliance with its financial and other reporting obligations as they apply to
such Nonassignable Excluded Asset. For clarity, nothing in this _Section
5.4(c)_ shall limit the Sellers obligation with respect to any Excluded
Liability.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and shall
cause their Affiliates to cooperate using their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer, obtain, or to cause to be transferred or
obtained, prior to the Closing or as soon as practicable thereafter, any
Permits issued or required under Environmental Law and necessary for any
Acquired Entity to own or operate the Business or the assets and properties of
the Acquired Entities.

Section 5.5  _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing occurs, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses, except as otherwise stated herein or
therein; _provided_ , that (a) Transfer Taxes (if any) shall be borne as
provided in _Section 6.5_, (b) all premiums required for issuance of the
Environmental Policy at Closing shall be borne by Seller (regardless of
whether the Environmental Policy was applied for by Seller or Buyer), and (c)
if and when Buyer, the Acquired Entities (following the Closing or, at the
request of Buyer, prior to the Closing), or its or their lender obtains a
binder, commitment, owners title insurance policy, and/or

 



37  lenders title insurance policy based upon a preliminary report listed in
the Disclosure Schedules, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for the cost
to Seller of such preliminary report. 

Section 5.6 _Public Disclosures_. Seller and Buyer agree that the initial
press release or releases to be issued with respect to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof. Thereafter, prior
to the Closing, Seller and Buyer each shall keep confidential, and shall
cause its Representatives to keep confidential all information regarding this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby not included in such initial press release or releases,
except for such additional disclosure as is (a) required to obtain necessary
actions, waivers, consents, and approvals from Governmental Authorities and
third parties, (b) required by applicable Law, court process, rule or
regulation of the SEC or by obligations pursuant to a listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or (c) customary in an offering memorandum,
prospectus, prospectus supplement or similar offering document with respect to
a bank financing or capital markets transaction of Buyer. From the date
hereof to the date that is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Seller,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, on one hand, and Buyer, on the
other, will consult with each other to the extent practicable before issuing
or submitting, and, to the extent practicable, will provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, other public
statement, or filing, notice, or request with a Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement, filing, notice, or request
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law,
court process, rule or regulation of the SEC or by obligations pursuant to a
listing agreement with a national securities exchange. The parties
obligations under this _Section 5.6_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing.

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) At least fifteen (15) days prior to Closing, Buyer shall make an offer of
employment to any Business Employee that Buyer wishes any Acquired Entity to
employ following the Closing, except for those Business Employees listed on
_Exhibit J_. Such offer of employment shall include a memorandum setting forth
the conditions of employment with the Acquired Entity following the Closing
(including base compensation and bonus opportunities and medical, dental,
disability, life insurance and retirement benefits). At or before 11:59 p.m.
Pacific Time on the day before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Acquired Entities to terminate all Business Employees who Buyer has notified
Seller (i) Buyer does not intend for any Acquired Entity to employ following
the Closing or (ii) have declined Buyers offer of employment. Seller shall
assume and discharge all liabilities to Business Employees who are terminated
prior to the Closing Date, whether in response to Buyers direction or
otherwise, including severance obligations under the retention letters listed
on _Schedule 3.16(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

 



38 (b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Entities to, assume, maintain and
honor, for those Business Employees who remain employed by an Acquired Entity
immediately after the Closing or are employed by an Acquired Entity or other
Buyer Affiliate within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), the obligations for payment
of severance and so-called "success bonuses" under the retention letters
listed on _Schedule 3.16(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, as such letters
are in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and, for not less than twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, shall provide to all such persons, for
so long during such 12-month period as they remain employees of an Acquired
Entity or other Buyer Affiliate, base compensation and employee benefits at
levels at least consistent with those in effect prior to the Closing Date, and
bonus opportunities at levels at least consistent with bonus opportunities
offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall assume
and discharge all obligations and liabilities of the Acquired Entities under
the employment agreements of those Business Employees listed on _Exhibit J_
and any Business Employees who are not Continuing Employees. Buyer
acknowledges that, effective upon the Closing, the Business Employees listed
on _Exhibit J_ will cease to be employed by any Acquired Entity and will
become employees of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, and that thereafter the
services of such Business Employees will be available to the Acquired
Entities only pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Transition Services Agreement (until such time as their employment with Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller shall terminate).

 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the substitution of Seller
or a designated ERISA Affiliate of Seller (other than any Acquired Entity) as
a (i) fiduciary, (ii) contributing employer, (iii) sponsoring employer and
(iv) trustee of each of the Company Benefit Plans. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Seller shall cause the termination of the active participation of each
present or former Business Employee and his or her beneficiaries in each
Company Benefit Plan, other than those Business Employees who remain or become
employed by Seller or an ERISA Affiliate (other than any Acquired
Entity) following the Closing Date. For purposes of clarity, from and after
the Closing Date, Seller shall assume the sponsorship of, and all liabilities
in connection with, Company Benefits Plans, and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities following the Closing) shall have
any liability or responsibility of any kind with respect to or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans or to any Participants in connection with the
Company Benefit Plans.

 

(e) On and after the Closing Date, Seller shall comply with the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 601, _et seq_. of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan that is subject to COBRA.

 

(f) Effective on the Closing Date, Buyer, an Acquired Entity or a designated
ERISA Affiliate of such party shall cause each Continuing Employee or covered
beneficiary thereof to be eligible for participation in each employee benefit
plan or

 



39  arrangement maintained by Buyer for the benefit of the Continuing Employees,
consistent with Buyers obligations in _Section 5.7(b)_. In determining
eligibility for participation and vesting in any employee benefit plan or
arrangement of Buyer, to the fullest extent permitted by the Code, periods of
service with the Acquired Entity prior to the Closing Date shall be counted,
except to the extent such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits. For purposes of clarity, other than as set forth in Section 5.7,
from and after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
after the Closing Date shall have any liability or responsibility of any kind
with respect to or in connection with any employee benefit plan or arrangement
established by Buyer for the benefit of the Continuing Employees after the
Closing Date.

 

(g) Except as provided in _Section 5.7(b)_, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and the Acquired Entities and each of them from any and all
liability, cost and expense, including without limitation reasonable
attorneys fees, payment of benefits, taxes and penalties in respect to each
of the Company Benefit Plans, whether or not that liability, cost or
expense was incurred before or after the Closing Date. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Seller shall not (and shall
cause the Acquired Entities not to) take any action that would have the effect
of requiring, Buyer to continue any specific employee benefit plans and
arrangements or to continue the employment or services of any specific person.

(h) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, if applicable, the
Company will take all necessary actions (including obtaining any required
waivers or consents from Disqualified Individuals) to submit for approval by
the stockholders of the Company, in a manner that satisfies Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code and the final Treasury Regulations issued thereunder,
the right of each Disqualified Individual to receive or retain, as applicable,
that portion of any payments and benefits that, together with any other
payments and benefits the Disqualified Individual may become entitled to
receive that may be considered "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2)
of the Code (" _Section 280G Payments_ "), exceeds 299% of such Disqualified
Individuals "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) such
that the deduction of such Section 280G Payments will not be limited by
the application of Section 280G(a) of the Code and the final Treasury
Regulations issued thereunder. If applicable, no later than four (4) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer certification
regarding the requisite stockholder vote with respect to any Section 280G
Payments and if the Company stockholder approval of Section 280G Payments was
not obtained, as a consequence, such payments and/or benefits shall not be
made or provided to the extent that they would cause any amounts to
constitute Section 280G Payments. The Company shall forward to Buyer at least
three (3) Business Days prior to submission to the stockholders of the Company
copies of all documents prepared by the Company in connection with this
Section 5.7(h) for Buyers review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(i) This _Section 5.7_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 5.7_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Participant) rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of 

 



40  this Section or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an
amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement of Buyer and Seller. 

Section 5.8 _Maintenance of Company Records; Personnel_. For a period of seven
(7) years following the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be
required by any Governmental Authority or as a result of any pending or
threatened Action or tax audit):

(a) (a) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, dispose of or destroy any of the material books, records, or
files of the Acquired Entities that exist on the Closing (the "
_Business Documents_ ") without first giving Seller not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the Business Documents proposed to be disposed of or destroyed; _provided_
that Buyer and its Affiliates may dispose of the Business Documents without
prior notice to Seller by virtue of a sale of stock or the assets of, or a
merger or consolidation involving, Buyer or any of its Affiliates if either
(i) the transferee thereof agrees to comply with _Section 5.8(a)_ and _(b)_
hereof with respect to the Business Documents that consist of Tax records for
the remainder of such seven (7) year period (or such longer period as may be
required by any Governmental Authority or as a result of any pending or
threatened Action) or (ii) Buyer or such transferee transfers the Business
Documents that consist of Tax records to Seller upon consummation of such
transaction. Seller shall have the right, at its option and expense, upon
written specification to Buyer within such thirty (30) day period of the
Business Documents desired to be retained by Seller, to copy or take
possession of all or a portion of such Business Documents within such thirty
(30) day period.

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, allow Seller and
its agents reasonable access to the Business Documents for any reasonable
business purpose during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice at
the Acquired Entities principal place of business or the location where the
Business Documents are stored, and Seller shall have the right, at its own
expense, to make copies of Business Documents; _provided_ , that any such
access and copying shall be undertaken in a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal conduct of the Acquired Entities business or
operations; _provided_ _further_ , that Buyer shall not be required to
disclose to Seller any information if Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities
following the Closing), on the other, are adverse parties in a litigation and
such information is reasonably pertinent thereto.

 

(c) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, make available to
Seller and its agents, upon written request and at the locations where such
persons are employed by Buyer or an Acquired Entity, (i) personnel of Buyer or
an Acquired Entity to assist Seller in locating and obtaining Business
Documents and (ii) personnel of Buyer or an Acquired Entity who prior to
the Closing Date were employed by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
and were involved in the preparation for, or undertaking of litigation,
administrative proceedings, Returns, Tax audits, or other similar matters in
which Seller is an interested party after the Closing Date; _provided_ , that
any such access and availability shall be undertaken in a manner so as not to
interfere unreasonably with such persons duties.

 



41 (d) Seller will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Related Parties
to hold in confidence, unless required to disclose by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of applicable Law, all
confidential documents and information concerning Buyer, the Business, and the
Acquired Entities, including any confidential documents and information
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9 _Resignations of Directors_. Seller shall cause to be delivered
to Buyer at the Closing, duly signed resignations, effective upon the Closing,
of all directors of the Acquired Entities, or shall take such other action as
may be necessary to cause such persons to cease being directors of the
Acquired Entities effective upon the Closing.

Section 5.10 _Payments Relating to Excluded Assets_. To the extent that,
after the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Entities), on the one hand, or Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other,
(i) receives any payments or other recoveries to which the other party is
entitled (including payments or other recoveries received by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) related to the Excluded
Assets), or (ii) makes any payment to a third party on behalf of the other
party (including payments made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Entities) related to the Excluded Liabilities), the other party
shall promptly deliver such amounts to, or reimburse, Seller or Buyer or their
respective designees, as applicable. Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities) shall cooperate with Seller, at Sellers sole cost, in
obtaining any Excluded Asset.

 

Section 5.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an
officer or director of the Acquired Entities (the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies,
claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) arising out of
or relating to any threatened or actual Action based in whole or in part on
or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of the Acquired Entities whether pertaining to
any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing Date (the " _D andO
Indemnified Liabilities_"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or relating to
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities to pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to each DandO
Indemnified Party), in each case to the full extent provided in the Acquired
Entities respective Organizational Documents and any other written agreements
of the Acquired Entities set forth on _Schedule 5.11(d)_ of the Disclosure

 



42  Schedules, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and subject to applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event any such Action is brought against any DandO
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Closing Date), (i) the
DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities to pay all
fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received and (ii) Buyer shall cause the Acquired
Entities to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of any such matter; _provided_ , that neither the Acquired Entities
nor Buyer shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any
DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
5.11_ shall notify Buyer upon learning of any such Action (but the failure so
to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may have under
this  _Section 5.11_ except to the extent such failure prejudices such
party). The parties hereto agree that all rights to indemnification hereunder,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of
any such Action, existing in favor of the DandO Indemnified Parties with
respect to matters occurring through the Closing Date shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any DandO
Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities.

 

(b) For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
the Acquired Entities to maintain, if available, a "tail" policy providing
officers and directors liability insurance covering the persons who are
presently covered by their officers and directors liability insurance
policies with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date, providing coverage not less favorable than provided by such insurance in
effect on the date hereof (the " _Existing D andO Policy_"); _provided_ , that
in no event shall the Acquired Entities be obligated to pay, with respect to
the entire seven year period following the Closing, premiums for insurance
under this _Section 5.11(b)_ that in the aggregate are greater than 250% of
such premiums paid or payable by the Acquired Entities in 2013 with respect
to the Existing DandO Policy (which premiums for such period are hereby
represented and warranted by Seller to be as set forth on _Schedule
5.11(b)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedules); _provided_   _further_ , that if
the annual premium for such coverage and amount of insurance would exceed 250%
of such current annual rate, the Acquired Entities shall provide the maximum
coverage which shall then be available at an annual premium equal to 250% of
such rate. Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities to pay such premiums.

(c) Buyer covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that it and
they shall not institute any Action in any court or before any administrative
agency or before any other tribunal against any of the current directors of
the Acquired Entities, in their capacity as such, with respect to
any liabilities, Actions or causes of action, judgments, claims or demands of
any nature or description (consequential, compensatory, punitive or
otherwise), in each such case to the extent resulting from their approval of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



43 (d) The Acquired Entities shall not take any action directly or indirectly to
disaffirm or adversely affect the provisions of the Organizational Documents
and any other written agreements of the Acquired Entities set forth on
_Schedule 5.11(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedules that provide indemnification of
and expense reimbursement to DandO Indemnified Parties.

Section 5.12 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) During the two (2) year period following the Closing Date, Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, engage, directly or indirectly,
in the construction or sale of more than ten (10) single-family homes
(including attached single-family homes) or single-family building lots per
year within one hundred (100) miles of any Owned Real Property (the "
_Restricted Business_ "); _provided_ , that, during the period starting on the
six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, the foregoing shall not be deemed to
preclude Seller or its Affiliates from seeking entitlements to develop within
such geographic areas from any Governmental Authority or acting as a
consultant or advisor in connection with a proposed or existing master-planned
community within such geographic areas.

(b) During the two (2) year period following the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from soliciting for employment,
directly or indirectly, or hiring any employees of the Acquired Entities as of
the day following the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the foregoing
prohibition shall not extend or apply to employing any such person who
contacts Seller, its Affiliates or their respective employees on his or her
own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by Seller, its
Affiliates or their respective employees (it being understood that placing
an advertisement does not constitute solicitation).

Section 5.13 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable and prior to the Closing, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer true and complete copies of the audited
consolidated stand-alone balance sheet of the Acquired Entities as of December
31, 2012, and the related audited consolidated stand-alone statements of
operations and cash flows for the twelve-month period ending on such date of
the Acquired Entities, in each case which present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and results of operations presented therein
as of the dates of, and for the periods referred to in, such financial
statements in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods covered thereby.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable and prior to the Closing, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer true and complete copies of the unaudited stand-
alone balance sheet of the Acquired Entities as of September 30, 2013, the
related stand-alone statements of operations and cash flows for the nine-
month period ending on such date of the Acquired Entities and the stand-alone
statements of operations and cash flows for the nine-month period ending on
September 30, 2012 of the Acquired Entities, in each case 

 



44  which, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations presented
therein as of the dates of, and for the periods referred to in, such
financial statements in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby.

 

Section 5.14 _Financing_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing, all commercially reasonable
cooperation requested by Buyer that is customary in connection with the
arrangement of debt or equity financing for transactions that are
substantially similar to the Transaction; provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, including (a) using its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide financial and other pertinent information
within Sellers knowledge or possession regarding the Business and the
Acquired Entities as may be reasonably requested in writing by Buyer in order
to consummate the Financing, including the financial statements described in
_Section 5.13_ (such financial statements described in _Section 5.13_, the "
_Required Information_ ") and (b) using its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its independent accountants to provide commercially reasonable
assistance to Buyer in connection with the Financing (including providing
consent to Buyer to use its audit reports in marketing material relating to
the Financing and issuing a customary "comfort letter" (in the case of
unaudited financial statements, that have not been subject to a review under
Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100) in connection with the Financing);
provided that Seller may deliver to Buyer one or more written notices stating
when it believes it has completed delivery of the Required Information (each,
a " _Delivery Notice_ ") and, unless Buyer in good faith reasonably believes
Seller has not completed delivery of the Required Information and, within
three (3) Business Days after the delivery of the latest Delivery Notice, has
delivered a written notice to Seller to that effect (stating which Required
Information has not been delivered), the date identified in Sellers
latest Delivery Notice shall be the date of delivery of the Required
Information and any supplements to the Required Information reasonably
requested by Buyer during the Marketing Period, it being understood and agreed
that, subject to customary confidentiality arrangements reasonably acceptable
to Seller (which confidentiality arrangements will permit the inclusion of any
information received pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ in offering documents
with respect to the Financing), the information and documents provided by
Seller pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ may be delivered to underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents or included in offering documents with
respect to the Financing; provided, further, that none of Seller or any of
its Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment, underwriting or other
fee or to incur (in the case of the Acquired Entities, prior to the Closing)
any other liability or obligation (including without limitation any potential
liability under securities Laws and indemnification for violations of
securities Laws) in connection with the Financing or to take any action that
would be prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a default of, or breach
under, or otherwise violate any Material Contract.

Section 5.15 _LLC Conversions_. Seller shall cause each Acquired Entity that
is a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" within the meaning of Section
1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code to convert to a Delaware limited liability company
effective no later than two (2)

 



45  days prior to the Closing Date (the " _LLC Conversions_ "). Seller shall
provide to Buyer any legal documents it intends to file in order to effect the
LLC Conversions a reasonable time before filing and shall accept any
reasonable comments made by Buyer. Following the LLC Conversions, any
references in this Agreement to "the Shares" shall mean 100% of the membership
interest in the Company, and any reference to the stockholders of the Company
or any Acquired Entity shall mean the members of the Company or the Acquired
Entity, as applicable.

 

Section 5.16 _Further Documentation_. Seller and Buyer will cooperate in good
faith to negotiate the Transition Service Schedules (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) and, as reasonably required or desirable to
transition the Business to Buyer, the Office Leases, in each case prior to the
Closing.

 

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS 

Section 6.1 _Tax Treatment_. Seller and Buyer agree (a) that the sale of the
Shares shall be treated, for federal and state income tax purposes, as a sale
by Seller and a purchase by Buyer of all of the assets of the Acquired
Entities (other than the equity interests in the Acquired Subsidiaries),
except that the equity interests in (and not the assets of) the Corporate
Subsidiaries and the Tax Partnerships shall be treated as assets so sold and
purchased and to report the sale for federal and state income tax purposes in
all respects consistently with such treatment and with the provisions of 
_Section 2.5_ and _Section 3.13(i)_, (b) that (i) the Nonassignable Excluded
Assets and (ii) any Excluded Liabilities that are indebtedness for federal and
state income tax purposes and remain the legal obligation of the Acquired
Entities after the Closing shall, in each case be treated, for federal and
state income tax purposes (and, to the extent permitted by Law, other Tax
purposes), as assets and liabilities, respectively, of Seller at all times
while such assets are owned by, or such liabilities are the liability of,
respectively, the Acquired Entities, and to report the ownership of such
assets and the liability for such liabilities for federal and state income tax
purposes in all respects consistently with such treatment, and (c) not to
take a position inconsistent with the treatment described in clauses (a) and
(b) of this paragraph in any Return or any Tax-related Action, unless required
by a final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code).

Section 6.2 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The parties shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Returns and in resolving
all Actions relating to Taxes (" _Tax-related Actions_ "), including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes of the Acquired Entities and any Taxes relating to the
assets or liabilities of the Acquired Entities (including the Excluded Assets
and Excluded Liabilities). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Acquired Entities shall retain in their possession, and shall
provide Seller access to (including the right to make copies of), such
supporting books and records and

 



46  any other materials that Seller may request with respect to matters relating
to Taxes for which Seller or its stockholders are liable under this Agreement
or otherwise, shall promptly furnish to Seller copies of all correspondence
received from any Governmental Authority in connection with any Tax-related
Action, and shall execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney or other
necessary documents in order for Seller to exercise its control over any Tax-
related Action controlled by Seller pursuant to _Section 6.3_. Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, respond promptly, and in any event
no later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of a request from Seller for
Tax-related information (including requests for information relating to an
information document request or similar request by any Governmental Authority)
pertaining to Seller or the Acquired Entities for any matters relating to
Taxes for which Seller or its stockholders are liable under this Agreement or
otherwise. To the extent Sellers information request pertains to a matter for
which Seller is liable under this Agreement, failure or delay by Buyer in
providing such information to Seller shall eliminate Sellers indemnity
obligations with respect to the item that is the subject of the information
request to the extent that Seller is prejudiced thereby.

 

Section 6.3 _Control Over Tax-related Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall control all Tax-related Actions
that are related solely to Taxes required to be shown on Returns described in
_Section 6.4(a)_ (including, for the sake of clarity, all S Corporation
Returns), but Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but not control)
any such Tax-related Actions controlled by Seller at its own expense if such
Tax-related Action would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Buyer, and
Seller shall not settle such Tax-related Actions without the consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such
settlement would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Buyer. Buyer shall
control all Tax-related Actions that are related solely to Taxes required to
be shown on Returns described in _Section 6.4(b)_, but Seller shall have the
right to participate in (but not control) any such Tax-related Actions
controlled by Buyer at its own expense if such Tax-related Action would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect Seller, and Buyer shall not settle
such Tax-related Actions without the consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such settlement would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect Seller.

 

Section 6.4 _Returns of Acquired Entities_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) (i) all
Returns of the Acquired Entities for Non-Income Taxes that are due on or
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all Returns of the Acquired Entities for
Income Taxes with respect to taxable periods that end on or before the Closing
Date, if any, and shall timely remit (or cause to be timely remitted)
the Taxes shown thereon as due (subject to any indemnity right under _Article
VIII_ ) to the applicable Governmental Authority. Each such Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past custom and practice except where
otherwise required by Law. Seller shall also prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed) all Internal Revenue Service Forms 1120S and comparable
state and local income Tax Returns of the Company (" _S Corporation Returns_
") for taxable years ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including any
such Returns for periods or portions of periods prior to the time the Company
became a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes). It is understood
that, for Income Tax purposes, tax items of the Acquired

 



47  Entities attributable to the period on or prior to the Closing Date shall be
included in Sellers (or, for periods prior to the time the Company became a
disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, the Companys) Income Tax
Returns. With respect to any Return described in this Section 6.4(a) filed
after the date hereof that could result in a liability for a Tax that is not
an Excluded Tax and is not reflected as a liability on the Balance Sheet,
Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy of such Return at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date on which such Return is due (or if such Return is due
within thirty-five (35) days after the Closing Date, then as soon as
reasonably practicable prior to the filing thereof). Seller shall consider all
comments on any such Return described in the immediately preceding sentence
made by Buyer in good faith within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof
(or if such Return is due within thirty-five (35) days after the Closing Date,
then within five (5) days after receipt thereof), and shall thereafter execute
and timely file (or cause to be executed and filed) such Return and timely
remit the Taxes shown as due thereon (subject to any indemnity right under
_Article VIII_ ) to the applicable Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing but without limitation on other rights of Buyer, copies of Returns
that are due within fewer than seven (7) days of the determination of the
date of the underlying Tax (e.g., payroll Tax deposit-related forms) shall not
be required to be provided to Buyer in advance of filing.

 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) (i) all
Returns of the Acquired Entities for Non-Income Taxes that are due after the
Closing Date, and (ii) all Returns of the Acquired Entities for Income Taxes
with respect to taxable periods that end after the Closing Date, and shall
timely remit the Taxes shown thereon as due (subject to any indemnity right
under _Article VIII_ ) to the applicable Governmental Authority. With respect
to any Return described in this Section 6.4(b) that could result in a
liability of Seller for a Tax, each such Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past custom and practice except where otherwise
required by Law and Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such Return at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Return is due (or if
such Return is due within thirty-five (35) days after the Closing Date, then
as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the filing thereof). Buyer shall
consider all comments on any such Return described in the immediately
preceding sentence made by Seller in good faith within fifteen (15) days
after receipt thereof (or if such Return is due within thirty-five (35) days
after the Closing Date, then within five (5) days after receipt thereof), and
shall thereafter execute and timely file (or cause to be executed and filed)
such Return and timely remit the Taxes shown as due thereon (subject to any
indemnity right under _Article VIII_ ) to the applicable Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing but without limitation on
other rights of Seller, copies of Returns that are due within fewer than
seven (7) days of the determination of the date of the underlying Tax (e.g.,
payroll Tax deposit-related forms) shall not be required to be provided to
Seller in advance of filing.

(c) Other than in connection with a Tax-related Action resolved in accordance
with this Agreement and other than with respect to the Corporate
Subsidiaries, Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of the Acquired
Entities to amend any Return described in _Sections 6.4(a)_ or, with respect
to any Return an amendment of which reasonably could be expected to be adverse
to Seller, _Section 6.4(b)_, except with the written consent of Seller,
which written consent of Seller, in the case of a Return described

 



48  in _Section 6.4(b)_ shall not be unreasonably withheld. Other than in
connection with a Tax-related Action resolved in accordance with this
Agreement, Seller shall not amend any Return described in Section 6.4(a) if
such amendment reasonably could be expected to be adverse to Buyer, except
with the written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Buyer (other
than Transfer Taxes in respect of the Divestitures, which shall be borne by
Seller). Buyer shall file or cause to be filed all necessary Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and Seller shall
cooperate as reasonably requested by and at the cost of Buyer in order to
minimize Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall file all required Transfer Tax forms and
shall file appropriate California Form(s) 100-B with respect to the
transactions described herein.

 

Section 6.6 _Straddle Period_. In any case under this Agreement involving a
Straddle Period: (i) any real, personal and intangible property Taxes and
other Taxes for the Pre-Balance Sheet Date Tax Period not based on operating
results such as payroll, sales or other items of income or expense (or a
combination thereof) shall equal the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Balance Sheet Date Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period, and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be for the Post-Balance
Sheet Date Period; provided, that any increase in such Taxes that arises as a
result of or in connection with the Transaction (including any increase in
property Taxes resulting from a change of ownership of properties owned by
the Acquired Entities) shall be attributed solely to the Post-Balance Sheet
Date Tax Period, and (ii) all other Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be determined as if the taxable period of the taxpayer ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date.

Section 6.7 _Refunds_. To the extent any Tax is refunded (in cash or by way
of a credit of Taxes) to Seller or its Affiliates or to Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities following the Closing) after the
Closing Date, such refund shall be paid to Seller or Buyer, respectively,
based on whether Seller, on one hand, or Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Entities), on the other hand, would be liable for such Tax under
this Agreement if instead of being refunded it actually became due (provided
that any refunds of Taxes reflected as a liability on the Balance Sheet shall
be for the account of Seller). Such amounts shall be paid to the party
entitled thereto within thirty (30) days following receipt (or, in the case of
a credit, following the end of the year in which such credit arises). Any
refund of Taxes in respect of the Acquired Entities that is attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Buyer and Seller in a
manner consistent with the principles of Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7. By
way of example and not limitation, if an Excluded Tax is refunded, Seller
shall be entitled to such refund. If any portion of any refund is subsequently
disallowed, then amounts previously paid hereunder in respect thereof shall
be promptly reimbursed to the paying party. Buyer shall cooperate, and shall
cause each of the Acquired Entities to cooperate, with commercially reasonable
requests by Seller to pursue refunds of Taxes to which Seller would be
entitled under this Section 6.7 provided that, prior to pursuing any such
refund,

 



49  Seller has agreed to reimburse Buyer and the Acquired Entities for any Taxes
resulting from the receipt of such refunds (and any Taxes thereon, net of the
Tax benefit of paying such refund to Seller) and to reimburse Buyer for
third-party out of pocket costs incurred to pursue such refund.

not material to Seller, or (ii) as to Buyer, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect if not obtained as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that in no event shall obtaining a Divestiture Consent or
Divestiture Release be a condition to the obligation to consummate the

and warranties) shall be true and correct, except, in the case of this clause

such effect. For clarity, a Divestiture shall not be deemed not to be
complete for any purpose hereunder as a result of the fact that as of Closing
or any other relevant date there may be outstanding Divesture Consents or
Divestiture Releases relative thereto; provided that Seller shall remain
obligated to continue to pursue any such Divestiture Consents or Divestiture
Releases pursuant to the second sentence of _Section 5.4(c)_.

similar qualifications contained in such representations and warranties) shall
be true and correct, except, in the case of this clause (ii), for breaches or
inaccuracies that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair the ability of Buyer to consummate

51 ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Solely for purposes
of _Sections 8.2_ and _8.3_ :

 

(a) the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ , other than the representations and warranties made by (i) Seller in
_Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.4_, _Section
3.13_ and _Section 3.19_ (the " _Seller Core Representations_ ") and (ii)
Buyer in _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.4_ and _Section 4.5_
(the " _Buyer Core Representations_ "), shall survive the Closing until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 3.10_, insofar as they refer to title to
or Liens upon Owned Real Property, shall not survive the Closing (it being
understood that this proviso shall not limit the survival of any other
representation or warranty herein or any claim with respect to a breach
thereof arising out of or related to title to or Liens upon Owned Real
Property, including with respect to _Section 3.6)_;

 

(b) the Buyer Core Representations, the Seller Core Representations and the
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement (other than those
agreements specified in clause (c) below) will survive the Closing until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; and

 

(c) indemnification rights with respect to Excluded Liabilities and Excluded
Taxes will survive the Closing until sixty (60) days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations (each such expiration date,
respectively, an " _Expiration Date_ ");

 

 _provided_ , that if written notice of a claim has been given in accordance
with _Section 8.6_ prior to the applicable Expiration Date, then such
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation to indemnify with
respect to an Excluded Tax or an Excluded Liability, as applicable, shall
survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. Neither
the period of survival nor the liability of either party hereto with respect
to its representations and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation
made or knowledge acquired by the other party except as set forth on the
Disclosure Schedules.

 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities after the
Closing) and their respective officers, directors, direct and indirect
shareholders, employees, agents, successors and assigns against any losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, penalties, awards,
and judgments, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and costs of
investigation, but excluding punitive damages, damages that are not the
reasonably foreseeable consequence of the relevant breach and damage to
reputation (other than such damages payable to a third party as a result of a
Third Party Claim indemnifiable hereunder or that arise or result from fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach by the Indemnifying Party)
(collectively, other than such excluded items, the " _Losses_ ") actually
suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party arising out of or resulting
from (i) the breach of any representation and warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder (provided that all
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications contained in
such representations and warranties (other than with respect to _Section
3.7_) shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating Losses (but not for
the purpose of determining the

 



52  occurrence of a breach) with respect thereto), (ii) the breach of any
covenant or agreement by Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii) any claims
against any Acquired Entity by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than
the Acquired Entities) or any lender or creditor of Seller or such Affiliate
of Seller acting in its capacity as such lender or creditor, or (iv) any
Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Taxes. For clarity, (a) Seller is not
providing any indemnification for Environmental Losses (including, without
limitation, Environmental Losses relating to Excluded Assets) other than
Indemnifiable Environmental Losses, and (b) the Environmental Policy
is intended to be Buyers sole source of recovery for Environmental Losses
(other than Uninsured Environmental Excluded Losses) relating to Excluded
Assets.

 

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer and, after the Closing, the
Acquired Entities shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Acquired Entities after the Closing) and their respective
officers, directors, direct and indirect shareholders, employees, agents,
successors and assigns against (A) any Losses actually suffered or incurred
by any such indemnified party arising out of or resulting from (i) the breach
of any representation and warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered hereunder (provided that all materiality, material
adverse effect or similar qualifications contained in such representations
and warranties shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating Losses (but
not for the purpose of determining the occurrence of a breach) with respect
thereto), (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by Buyer contained in
this Agreement, (iii) any obligations or liabilities of any kind or nature,
primary or secondary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, known or
unknown, whether or not accrued and whether arising before, on or after the
Closing Date, of the Acquired Entities, except, solely with respect to clause
(iii), to the extent that such obligations or liabilities are Excluded
Liabilities, Excluded Taxes or are otherwise indemnifiable by Seller pursuant
to _Section 8.2_, or (iv) any Taxes described in _Schedule 8.3_ and (B) any
and all Losses (except for Losses arising out of or resulting from the breach
of representations or warranties set forth in  _Section 3.13(i)_) actually
suffered or incurred by reason of the LLC Conversions.

Section 8.4 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein (other than the proviso ending this _Section 8.4_):

(a) the maximum amount payable by an Indemnifying Party for Losses solely
pursuant to _Section 8.2(i)_ or _Section 8.3(A)(i)_ shall not exceed an
aggregate amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Cap_ "); _provided_ , that the foregoing Cap shall not apply to (i) Losses
arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of any Seller Core
Representation or Buyer Core Representation or (ii) any Losses relating to
the Balance Sheet Date Net Cash reflected in the calculation of the Purchase
Price;

(b) no amount shall be payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(i)_ unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable thereunder exceeds an amount
equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "),
in which event Seller shall be liable for the amount (if any) in excess of
the Deductible, and no amount shall be payable pursuant to _Section
8.3(A)(i)_ unless and until

 



53  the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable thereunder exceeds the
Deductible, in which event Buyer shall be liable for the amount (if any) in
excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , that the limitations set forth in this
_Section 8.4(b)_ shall not apply to (i) any Losses arising out of or relating
to the inaccuracy or breach of any Seller Core Representation or Buyer Core
Representation or (ii) any Losses relating to the Balance Sheet Date Net Cash
reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price;

(c) Seller shall not be liable for (i) Taxes (and any related Losses) other
than Excluded Taxes, except for Taxes (and any related Losses) arising out of
or resulting from the breach of representations or warranties set forth in
_Section 3.13(g)_ or, if by or at the request of Seller or its Affiliates
(excluding, following the Closing Date, the Acquired Entities) a Form 8832 (or
comparable state Tax form) was filed to cause any of the Acquired Entities
(other than the Corporate Subsidiaries) to be treated as a corporation
for Income Tax purposes, _Section 3.13(i)_, and (ii) any Excluded Taxes
arising on the Closing Date as a result of actions taken outside of the
ordinary course of business, or inconsistent with past practices, of the
Acquired Entities, by or at the request of Buyer or its Affiliates;

(d) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer with respect to any Loss
to the extent that such Loss was reflected in the computation of
Distributions, Non-Acquired Entity Expenditures or Balance Sheet Date Net
Cash; and

 

(e) no amount shall be payable pursuant to Section 8.2(i) or (ii) or Section
8.3(A)(i) or (ii) if indemnification therefor is disallowed pursuant to
_Section 5.3(c)_;

_provided_ , that none of the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4_
shall apply in the event of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
intentional breach by any Indemnifying Party.

Section 8.5 _Losses Net of Insurance; Adjustment to Purchase Price;
Environmental Policy_. The amount of any Losses under this _Article VIII_
shall be determined net of any related amounts recovered or recoverable using
commercially reasonable efforts by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies, indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements with respect to such
Losses (net of expenses incurred in obtaining any such recovery and, with
respect to recovery under insurance policies, net of the deductible for such
policies and any increase in the premium (and retro-premium adjustments) for
such policies to the extent arising out of or in connection with such Losses).
Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes
as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
Law. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure coverage under
the Environmental Policy for a period of at least ninety (90) days from and
after the initial denial of coverage. Notwithstanding the terms of the
Environmental Policy, Seller shall have no right to, and shall not, seek
coverage as an additional insured for any Loss under the Environmental Policy
unless and until Buyer has made a claim for coverage under the Environmental
Policy and has exhausted its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under
the Environmental Policy as provided herein, and Buyer is seeking
indemnification for such Loss from Seller under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that in the event Seller is entitled to seek such coverage pursuant to the
foregoing, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable

 



54  efforts to cooperate with Seller in Sellers effort to seek coverage,
including without limitation providing a power of attorney reasonable in scope
to the extent necessary to pursue such coverage. Any indemnification payments
made by an Indemnifying Party in respect of a claim shall, to the extent the
Indemnified Party later receives an insurance recovery in respect thereof, be
repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party.

Section 8.6 _Procedures_.

 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give each party from whom indemnification is
being sought (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter which
such Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right
of indemnification under this Agreement, within ninety (90) days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed;
_provided_ , that the failure timely to provide such notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure.

(b) The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ with
respect to Losses arising from the claim of any third party which are subject
to the indemnification provided for in this _Article VIII_ (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") shall be governed by the following additional terms and conditions:
If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party
Claim within fifteen (15) days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
notice; _provided_ , that the failure timely to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article
VIII_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party in full against any Losses that may result
from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and
through counsel of its choice who is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party if the Indemnifying Party gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that (i) if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, or the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction
or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related
claim for money damages, or (ii) if the Third Party Claim is made by a
governmental agency (other than any Tax authority), then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (which, in the case of clause
(i), shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, but, in the
case of clause (ii), shall be chosen in the Indemnified Partys sole
discretion) at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake such defense against a
Third

 



55  Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses and pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or
under the Indemnified Partys reasonable control as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably require. Similarly, in the event that the Indemnified Party is
conducting the defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available
to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all such
witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys
possession or under the Indemnifying Partys reasonable control as the
Indemnified Party may reasonably require.

 

(c) Without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment where such settlement, compromise or entry of judgment
could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Indemnified
Party (taking into account the Indemnified Partys rights under this 
_Article VIII_) or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written
release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim without
the acknowledgement of any culpability or fault. Without the written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, the Indemnified Party conducting the defense against a
Third Party Claim shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment; provided, that the Indemnified Party may
enter into such a settlement, compromise or consent if (i) such settlement,
compromise or judgment does not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
impose or increase any separate liability of or obligation on the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnifying Party of a written release from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim (other than with respect to the
Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations hereunder), and (iii) either
(x) the Indemnified Party is reasonably expected to be liable for Losses
materially in excess of amounts reasonably expected to be received from the
Indemnifying Party or (y) such settlement or compromise is in respect of a
proceeding that seeks an injunction or equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent there is a
conflict between this _Section 8.6_ and _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.3_ shall
control.

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy and Environmental Release_. Except to the
extent that indemnification is provided for elsewhere in this Agreement,
indemnification provided in this _Article VIII_, subject to the limitations
set forth herein, shall be the exclusive monetary remedy available to
an Indemnified Party after the Closing for any breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained in this Agreement. Other than
the right of the parties hereto to seek enforcement of any provision in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or damages for any breach of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (including any indemnification provided
hereunder or thereunder), the parties hereto hereby agree that they release
one another from any and all claims, demands, or causes of action with
respect to any liability under any Environmental Law and

 



56  specifically, but without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act, 42 USC Section 9601 et. seq., with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement (it being understood that
this sentence shall not limit Buyer or its respective Affiliates rights or
any rights of Seller with respect to the Environmental Policy).

 

Section 8.8 _Seller s Minimum Post-Closing Net Worth; Replacement
Indemnitor_. Seller covenants and agrees that until every Expiration Date has
occurred, Seller shall maintain a minimum net worth based on the fair market
value of its assets as of any relevant determination date of at least Two
Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000); _provided_ , that (i) such amount
shall be reduced in increments of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) for each
twelve-month period that elapses following the fourth (4th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (ii) such amount shall be reduced to zero effective as of
the eighth (8th) anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Seller shall have the right at any time
following the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date to substitute a
replacement indemnitor for Seller under _Section 8.2_ (and Seller shall be
released from any further liability thereunder); _provided_ , that no such
substitution and release shall be effective unless and until Buyer has been
provided at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of such
substitution and release with (i) the name and identity of such replacement
indemnitor (including a description of its relationship with Seller), (ii) the
instrument by which such replacement indemnitor either has assumed or will
assume all obligations of Seller under Section 8.2 and this Section 8.8
(which instrument shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer), and (iii) current financial statements (consistent with those provided
in the case of Seller) reasonably demonstrating that the replacement
indemnitor meets the then applicable minimum net worth requirement set forth
in this _Section 8.8_.

 

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing as follows:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; or

 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if any Governmental Authority shall have issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Transaction and such order, decree,
ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable; or

 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if the Transaction shall not have been
consummated on or before the later of March 31, 2014 or, if the Marketing
Period has, as of March 31, 2014, commenced, ten (10) Business Days after the
termination of the Marketing Period (the " _Outside Date_ ") (other than due
to such partys failure to perform its material obligations under this
Agreement); or

 



57 (d) by Buyer, if Seller shall have breached any of its representations and
warranties in  _Article III_ sufficient to result in a Material Adverse
Effect and such breach cannot be cured prior to the Closing, or if Seller
fails to perform in any material respect any of its obligations under this
Agreement and such non-performance has not been or is incapable of being
cured by Seller within thirty (30) days after its receipt of written notice
thereof from Buyer;

 

(e) by Seller, if Buyer shall have breached any of its representations and
warranties in _Article IV_ sufficient to prevent or materially impair the
ability of Buyer to consummate the Transaction and such breach cannot be cured
prior to the Closing, or if Buyer fails to perform in any material respect any
of its obligations under this Agreement and such non-performance has not been
or is incapable of being cured by Buyer within thirty (30) days after its
receipt of written notice thereof from Seller; or

(f) by Buyer, in accordance with _Section 2.6_.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Seller or Buyer as provided in _Section 9.1_, then
(a) all obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate
and have no effect, except for the provisions of _Section 2.2_ relating
to the post-termination disposition of the Deposit, _Section 3.19_ and
_Section 4.4_ relating to brokers fees and finders fees, _Section 5.3(a)_
relating to confidentiality, _Section 5.5_ relating to fees and expenses,
_Section 5.6_ relating to public announcements, this _Section 9.2_ and
_Article X_ of this Agreement, which provisions shall survive such
termination, and (b) there shall be no liability on the part of one party to
the other party under or by reason of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) fraudulent acts by a party, and
(ii) prior willful breaches by a party of a representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of this Agreement, the remedies for which
shall not be limited by the provisions of this _Section 9.2_. The foregoing
provision shall not, however, limit or restrict the availability of specific
performance or other injunctive or equitable relief to the extent that
specific performance or such other relief would otherwise be available to a
party hereunder.

 

ARTICLE X

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 10.1 _Amendment; Extension; Modification_. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of both of the
parties or waived except by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against whom enforcement is sought. Either party may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party
referring expressly to the provisions hereof being extended or waived. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

 



58  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not
similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
expressly provided. To the extent that any amendment or modification to
_Sections 10.1_ , _10.5_ or _10.14_ of this Agreement is sought that is
adverse to the rights of the Debt Financing Sources, the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources (or their respective successors or
assigns) party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter shall be required
before such amendment or modification is rendered effective.

be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) on the date of delivery if
delivered personally, or if by facsimile, upon written confirmation of receipt

Section 10.3 _Interpretation_. A reference made in this Agreement to a
Section, Exhibit or Schedule, shall be to a Section of, or an Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Whenever any reference is made to documents or other information made
available in the Dataroom, such words shall mean that such documents or
information were available to Buyer prior to and through the date that is two
(2) calendar days prior to execution of this Agreement in the electronic
dataroom maintained on behalf of Seller by Intralinks (as evidenced by a DVD
or CD-ROMs imprinted with all such documents or information and delivered by
Seller to Buyer promptly following the date hereof) (the " _Dataroom_ "). Each
party was represented by legal counsel of its choosing in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement or any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed against
any party because such party or its legal Representatives prepared the
initial or any subsequent draft of such provision.

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, which includes all Exhibits
and Schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Nothing herein
supersedes or impairs in any way the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon the Closing.

 

Section 10.5 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided in
_Sections 4.6(a)_ (last sentence), _8.2_ and  _8.3_ of this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or confers upon
any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any
nature under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, that the Debt Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to
rely upon the last sentence of _Section 10.1_, this _Section 10.5_ and
Section _10.14_ hereof, and each such Debt Financing Source may enforce such
provisions.

Section 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws of any
other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws
principles of the State of Delaware.

 



60 Section 10.7 _Jurisdiction and Venue; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4_, each of the parties submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in
any Action arising under or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all
claims in respect of the Action may be heard and determined in any such court
and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so brought. Each party
agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might
be served in any Action may be made on such party by sending or delivering a
copy of the process to the party to be served at the address of the party and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing
in this _Section 10.7_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each party agrees that a
final, non-appealable judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law.

 

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 10.8 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ , that Buyer
may assign its rights under this Agreement to a partnership, corporation, or
limited liability company (or other entity reasonably acceptable to Seller) of
which Buyer is a partner, shareholder, member or other equity participant,
provided that no such assignment shall release Buyer from any of
its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement except to the extent
expressly agreed in writing by Seller. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



61 Section 10.9 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in a
manner materially adverse to either party hereto.

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 10.11 _Facsimile Signature_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or other electronic image scan signature and a facsimile or other
electronic image scan signature will constitute an original for all purposes.

 

Section 10.12 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.13 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Buyer and
Seller acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by
counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against
the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

Section 10.14 _Non-Recourse_. Subject to the rights of Buyer and First
Huntingdon Finance Corp. under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, none of
the financing sources party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any of
their respective former, current or future stockholders, partners, members,
controlling parties, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives, and no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney
or representative of any of such financing sources nor any of their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Debt Financing
Sources_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim (whether in contract, tort
or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of (or in any way relating
to), the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance
thereof and the parties hereto agree not to assert any such claim or bring any
