Stock or any shares of capital stock or membership interests of Parent or the
Surviving Company under the cancelled Options, and without respect to whether
or not any such Option was vested or unvested as of the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, the holders of each outstanding Option for which the
per share exercise price exceeds the Common Per Share Merger Consideration,
shall have the right to future payments of the Common Per Share Merger
Consideration to the extent that the Common Per Share Merger Consideration
exceeds the per share exercise price of such Option (including with respect to
payments of the Milestone Consideration, if any).

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to cause each outstanding (i) Restricted Share and (ii)
RSU, whether vested or unvested, to be cancelled and extinguished effective as
of the Effective Time. Each RSU Holder shall have the right to receive,
following the effective Time, an amount for each RSU equal to the Common Per
Share Merger Consideration. Thereafter, without impairing the rights of RSU
Holders to receive payments to the extent set forth herein, the RSU Holders
and the holders of Restricted Shares shall, as of the Effective Time, cease
to have any further rights or entitlements to acquire any Company Common
Stock or any shares of capital stock or membership interests of Parent or the
Surviving Company under the cancelled RSUs.

 

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to cause each outstanding Warrant, whether vested or
unvested, to be cancelled and extinguished effective as of the Effective Time,
and the holder of each such Warrant, shall

 



-31- 

    

 have the right to receive, following the Effective Time, an amount for each
vested share of Series D Preferred Stock subject to a Warrant equal to (A) the
Preferred Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to shares of Series D
Preferred Stock _minus_ (B) the per share exercise price for such Warrant.
Thereafter, without impairing the rights of the Warrant Holders to receive
payments to the extent set forth herein, the Warrant Holders shall, as of the
Effective Time, cease to have any further right or entitlement to acquire any
shares of Series D Preferred Stock under the cancelled Warrants.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Reverse Merger, each Share
held in the Companys treasury or by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall, by virtue
of the Reverse Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2, the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled and retired and
cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(f) At the Effective Time, upon the consummation of the Reverse Merger,
each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub 1
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub 1
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation into which the shares of common
stock of Merger Sub 1 were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

(g) At the Second Effective Time, upon the consummation of the Second-Step
Merger, each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
First-Step Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into one membership
interest of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of common stock of the First-Step Surviving
Corporation shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
membership interests of the Surviving Company into which the shares of common
stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 2.9. _Surrender and Payment of Closing Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Account_. Acquiom Financial LLC, in its
capacity as payments administrator (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), shall act as
the agent for the purpose of paying the Closing Merger Consideration, pursuant
to a payments administration agreement among Parent, the Securityholder
Representative and the Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. The Exchange Agents fees and
expenses shall be borne equally by Parent and the Company Securityholders.
Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)(i)_, the Closing Merger Consideration
shall be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock, as determined based on the
Parent Market Price as of the date of this Agreement. At or promptly following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to
deposit, with the Exchange Agent certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued as Closing Merger Consideration (or make
appropriate alternative arrangements if uncertificated shares of Parent
Common Stock represented by book-entry shares will be issued)

 



-32- 

    

 and an amount in cash representing cash to be issued as Closing Merger
Consideration to Non-Accredited Securityholders (the " _Exchange Account_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any holder of Company Capital
Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants representing at least five percent (5%) of
the Fully Diluted Shares of the Company at the Closing, such holders portion
of the Closing Merger Consideration shall be payable directly to such holder
at the Closing (and shall not be deposited in the Exchange Account) if such
holder delivered a Letter of Transmittal and the documents reasonably
requested by the Exchange Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) _Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit or shall cause the
Surviving Company to deposit with SunTrust Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ")
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). " _Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount_ " means an amount of cash equal to $500,000
(together with all distributions, dividends and payments thereon, the "
_Purchase Price Adjustment_ _Escrow Fund_ "). The Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
of and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Mergers by
the Company Securityholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement
and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the indemnification
obligations, placement of Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount in escrow
and the appointment of the Securityholder Representative and establishment of
the Representative Reserve.

 

(c) _Securityholder Representative Reserve_. At the Closing, Parent shall
deposit or shall cause the Surviving Company to deposit with the
Securityholder Representative an amount equal to $250,000 (the "
_Representative Reserve_ "), which amount shall be used to reimburse or to
fund potential expenses of the Securityholder Representative in carrying out
its authorized duties in accordance with _Article 8_ hereof.

(d) _Estimated Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Company Transaction
Fees and Indebtedness_. The Company has delivered to Parent its good faith
estimate of (i) the Closing Working Capital Amount (the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Closing Cash on Hand (the " _Estimated Cash on
Hand_ "), (iii) the Closing Company Transaction Fees (the " _Estimated Company
Transaction Fees_ ") and (iv) the Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), including, in each case, reasonable support for
its calculation of each such item and line item detail of the components
thereof. A pro forma calculation of Net Working Capital prepared to reflect
the Companys anticipated Net Working Capital as of June 30, 2019 is attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_ , and the Estimated Net Working Capital shall be
calculated in accordance with the accounting principles and components set
forth on _Exhibit D_. 

(e) _Merger Consideration Schedule_. At least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a Merger
Consideration Schedule (the " _Merger Consideration Schedule_ "), setting
forth Companys calculation of the allocation of the Closing Merger
Consideration among the Company Securityholders, in addition to an electronic
copy thereof in Microsoft Excel format. Parent shall be able to rely on, and
shall have no

 



-33- 

    

 liability to any party to this Agreement or to any Company Securityholder
for any payment reflected on, the Merger Consideration Schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding anything set forth to the
contrary in the Merger Consideration Schedule, Parent shall make all payments
to Non-Accredited Securityholders in cash rather than Parent Common Stock. The
Merger Consideration Schedule shall include:

 

(i) the name, address (as listed in the corporate record books of the
Company), email address (if available) and the social security number or tax
identification number of each Company Securityholder;

(ii) the number of shares (separated by class and series) of Company
Capital Stock, or the number of Warrants, RSUs, Restricted Shares or shares of
Company Common Stock underlying Options held by each Company Securityholder;

 

(iii) certificate number(s) for all Company Capital Stock; and

 

(iv) the allocation of the Closing Merger Consideration among the Company
Securityholders, determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Companys Organizational Documents as in effect as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Indebtedness and Company Transaction Fees_. At the Closing, Parent
shall deliver or pay, or shall cause the Surviving Company to deliver or pay,
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the balance of
amounts of the Indebtedness identified on an " _Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_
" (which shall exclude the Bridge Notes) and outstanding Company Transaction
Fees identified on a " _Company Transaction Fees Schedule_ ", each delivered
to Parent by the Company prior to the Closing Date, as follows:

 

(i) all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding balances
of the Indebtedness identified on the Indebtedness Payoff Schedule shall be
paid on behalf of the Company to the applicable creditors accounts set forth
in the Payoff Letters or as otherwise advised by such creditors in writing;
and

 

(ii) all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding balances
of Transaction Fees identified on the Company Transaction Fees Schedule shall
be paid on behalf of the Company to the accounts designated by the Persons
owed such amounts as set forth on the Company Transaction Fees Schedule.

 

(g) _Closing Management Bonus_. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or
pay to the Surviving Company an amount equal to the Closing Management Bonus
for distribution to the individuals set forth on _Schedule 2_ through the
Surviving Companys payroll payment system (in each case, subject to
applicable withholding Taxes).

 

(h) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder
of Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants at the Effective Time,
whose Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants were converted pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ into the right to receive the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, a letter of transmittal (in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ ) (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates

 



-34- 

    

 representing the Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants, or
transfer of the Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants in book-entry
form to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal will be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving
Company may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange. Each holder of
Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants that have been
converted into the right to receive the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall
be entitled to receive the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which such
Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants have been converted pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ in respect of the Company Capital Stock, Options,
RSUs or Warrants represented by a certificate or in book-entry form following
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate or
certificates representing Company Capital Stock or Warrants or (ii) receipt
of such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request in the case of book-entry Company Capital Stock; in each
case, together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Exchange Agent. No interest shall be paid or accrued upon the surrender or
transfer of any Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants. Upon
payment of the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article 2_ , each share of Company Capital Stock, Option, RSU or Warrant so
surrendered or transferred shall immediately be cancelled.

 

(i) _Payments to Non-Registered Holders_. If any portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered shares of Company Capital Stock, Options,
RSUs or Warrants is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that:
(i) such certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock,
Options, RSUs or Warrants shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such book-entry share of Company Capital Stock,
Option, RSU or Warrant shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such share of Company Capital Stock, Option, RSU or Warrant, or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable. For the avoidance of doubt, a Company
Securityholder may transfer or assign its right to its portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the previous sentence.

(j) _Full Satisfaction_. The Aggregate Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or
Warrants formerly represented by such certificate or in book-entry form, and
from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants or
book-entry Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants are presented to
the Surviving Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this _Article 2_.

 

(k) _Termination of Exchange Account_. Any portion of the Exchange Account
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs
or Warrants six (6) months after the date that the last payment is made by
Parent with respect to any

 



-35- 

    

 Milestone Consideration, shall be returned to Parent, and any such holder
who has not exchanged Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants for the
Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for
payment of the Closing Merger Consideration without any interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
Company Capital Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Capital
Stock, Options, RSUs or Warrants two (2) years after the date that the last
payment is made by Parent with respect to any Milestone Consideration (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(l) _Restrictions_. All shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, issued
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be issued in a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act by reason of Section 4(2) thereof
and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and may not be re-
offered or resold other than in conformity with the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and such other applicable rules and Laws or pursuant to
an exemption therefrom. Until the resale by the Company Securityholders of
their Parent Common Stock has become registered (including pursuant to the
Registration Statement) under the Securities Act, or otherwise transferable
pursuant to an exemption from such registration otherwise required
thereunder, the Parent Common Stock issued to the Company Securityholders
shall be characterized as " _restricted securities_ " under the Securities Act
and, if certificated, shall bear the following legend (or if held in book-
entry form, will be noted with a similar restriction):

"THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY, AND THE RESALE OF SUCH SHARES HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE RESOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT."

 

Parent agrees to cooperate in a timely manner with the Company Securityholders
holding Registrable Securities to remove any restrictive legends or
similar transfer instructions from the Registrable Securities upon the
registration of the Registrable Securities or in the event that the
Registrable Securities are otherwise transferable pursuant to an exemption
from registration otherwise required thereunder.

Section 2.10. _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing Company
Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed
certificate, the Closing Merger

 



-36- 

    

 Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock
formerly represented by such certificate as contemplated under this _Article
2_.

 

Section 2.11. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Closing Balance Sheet_. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a
statement setting forth Parents good faith determination of the Closing
Working Capital Amount, the Closing Cash on Hand, the Closing Company
Transaction Fees and the Closing Indebtedness and any Closing Consideration
Adjustment resulting therefrom (the " _Closing Statement_ ").

(b) _Objection Period_. The Securityholder Representative shall have
thirty (30) Business Days from its receipt of the Closing Statement (the "
_Objection Period_ ") to review the Closing Statement. Parent shall grant the
Securityholder Representative access, at reasonable times and places and upon
reasonable advance notice, to all books, records and employees of the
Surviving Company as reasonably requested by the Securityholder Representative
in connection with its review of the Closing Statement. Upon the expiration
of the Objection Period, the Securityholder Representative shall be deemed to
have accepted, and shall be bound by, the Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount, the Closing Cash on Hand,
the Closing Company Transaction Fees and the Closing Indebtedness unless the
Securityholder Representative shall have informed Parent in writing of its
disagreement with the Closing Statement prior to the expiration of the
Objection Period (the " _Objection_ "), specifying each disputed item and
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such dispute (each, a "
_Disputed Item_ "). Parent shall have thirty (30) Business Days from the date
on which it receives the Objection (the date on which such thirty
(30)-Business Day period ends, the " _Response Date_ ") to review and respond
to the Objection. Parent shall be deemed to have accepted the
Securityholder Representatives calculations of the Disputed Items unless
Parent informs the Securityholder Representative in writing of its
disagreement with such Disputed Items. If Parent and the Securityholder
Representative are able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each
Disputed Item, and each signs a certificate to that effect, the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount set forth
therein, as adjusted to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed final, non-
appealable and binding for all purposes under this Agreement. If any Disputed
Item has not been resolved by the Response Date or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, either Parent or the Securityholder Representative may
refer such Disputed Item to an independent, mutually agreeable, nationally
recognized public accounting firm (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") who shall
accept its appointment within seven (7) days after such referral, to make a
final, non-appealable and binding determination as to any such remaining
Disputed Item pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Independent
Accountant shall be directed to make a determination of each Disputed Item in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.11(c)_ promptly, but no later than thirty
(30) days, after acceptance of its appointment. Parent and the Securityholder
Representative agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the
selection and appointment of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_, including executing an engagement agreement with the
Independent Accountant providing for reasonable and customary compensation
and other terms of such engagement.

(c) _Dispute Resolution_.

 



-37- 

    

(i) If any Disputed Item is referred to the Independent Accountant for
resolution pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_, the Independent Accountant
shall determine only with respect to such Disputed Item submitted whether such
Disputed Item as set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment and
the amount of any such required adjustment. Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to submit presentations and other
documentation to support their respective calculations of each such Disputed
Item to the Independent Accountant and shall instruct the Independent
Accountant to, and the Independent Accountant shall, make its determination
based solely on such documentation and presentations submitted by the
Securityholder Representative and Parent in accordance with the guidelines
and procedures set forth in this Agreement and in the engagement agreement
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_ and not on the basis of an independent
review. With respect to each submitted Disputed Item, the Independent
Accountants determination shall be within the range of values assigned to
such Disputed Item by Parent and the Securityholder Representative. Any
finding by the Independent Accountant shall be: (A) a reasoned award stating
in reasonable detail the findings of fact on which it is based, (B) final,
non-appealable and binding upon the parties hereto and (C) accompanied by a
certificate from the Independent Accountant certifying that it reached such
findings in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_.

 

(ii) The expenses of any dispute resolution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.11(c)_ including those charged by the Independent Accountant or incurred by
any party hereto in enforcing a final determination of any Disputed Item on
the part of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between Parent, on
the one hand, and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration), on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the aggregate dollar value of the Disputed Items not
awarded to Parent and the Securityholder Representative bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party. For example, should the spread between the
Disputed Items total $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600
in favor of the Securityholder Representatives position, Parent would bear
60% (i.e., $600 ÷ $1000) of the costs of dispute resolution and the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders) would
bear 40% (i.e., $400 ÷ $1000) of the costs of dispute resolution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders) shall bear the
expenses of its own Representatives incurred by it in connection with the
preparation or review of the Closing Statement or any Objection thereto.

 

(d) _Adjustment_. If, upon the final determination of the Closing Working
Capital Amount, the Closing Cash on Hand, the Closing Company Transaction
Fees and the Closing Indebtedness as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_ or
_2.11(c)_ , as applicable:

 

(i) the result would be that the Closing Consideration Adjustment is a
negative number, then: (A) the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of such Closing Consideration
Adjustment to Parent from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, (B) if
the aggregate amount in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover the full amount of such Closing Consideration
Adjustment, then each Company Securityholder entitled to a portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement shall, within
ten (10) Business Days

 



-38- 

    

 following such final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount,
Closing Cash on Hand, Closing Company Transaction Fees and Closing
Indebtedness, pay such Company Securityholders portion of the amount of such
deficiency to Parent, in accordance with such Company Securityholders Pro
Rata Share and (C) if the aggregate amount in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund is greater than the amount needed to cover the full amount of the
Closing Consideration Adjustment, then the Securityholder Representative and
Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent following payment of
the Closing Consideration Adjustment for distribution to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares;

 

(ii) the result would be that the Closing Consideration Adjustment is a
positive number, then the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares; or

(iii) if the result would be that the Closing Consideration Adjustment is
zero, then the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release the balance of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company Securityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 

(e) Any instruction to the Escrow Agent required to be delivered pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(d)(i)_ shall be delivered, and any payment required
to be made by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11(d)(ii)_ shall be made:
(x) if no Objection is made by the Securityholder Representative during the
Objection Period, within ten (10) days following the expiration of the
Objection Period or (y) if the Securityholder Representative submits an
Objection within the Objection Period, within ten (10) days following the
final determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash on
Hand, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Company Transaction Fees as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_ or _2.11(c)_ , as applicable. To the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, any payment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.11_ shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment to the aggregate
Closing Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.12. _Milestone Consideration_.

 

(a) _Milestones and Milestone Consideration_. As additional consideration
for the Mergers, and subject to the deductions set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.12(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.12(g)_, after the Effective Time, the Company
Securityholders will be entitled to receive the Milestone Consideration set
forth below, when and if required to be paid in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
maximum amount payable to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.12_ is $260,000,000. For clarity, the Milestone
Consideration under this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ will be owed to the Company
Securityholders whether the milestone event triggering such Milestone
Consideration being owed was achieved by Parent or any of its Affiliates or
any of its or their (sub)licensees, or any (sub)licensees sublicensees.

 

(i) _Interim Success Milestone_. In the event that the Interim Success
Milestone (as defined on _Schedule 1_  hereto) is achieved, Parent shall pay
to the

 



-39- 

    

 Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Company Securityholders pursuant to
their respective Pro Rata Shares, $25,000,000 (the " _Interim Success
Milestone Consideration_ "), payable in shares of Parent Common Stock
(determined based on the Parent Market Price as of the date of achievement of
such Interim Success Milestone) or cash, in its sole discretion, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)_. If the Interim Success Milestone is achieved and
paid in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(i)_, the PMA Milestone
Consideration, if the PMA Milestone is later achieved, will be reduced by
$25,000,000.

 

(ii) _PMA Milestone_. In the event that, on or before December 31, 2022
(the " _PMA Milestone Initial Period_ "), the FDA issues premarket approval
(" _PMA_ ") of the LARIAT System with an approved indication allowing
commercial distribution in the United States for the closure of the left
atrial appendage (LAA) for treatment of atrial fibrillation (the "
_Indication_ ") (the " _PMA Milestone_ "), Parent shall pay to the Exchange
Agent, for distribution to the Company Securityholders pursuant to their
respective Pro Rata Shares, $140,000,000 payable in shares of Parent Common
Stock (determined based on the Parent Market Price as of the date of
achievement of such PMA Milestone) or cash, in its sole discretion, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(e) _and subject to reduction pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.12(a)(i)_ if the Interim Success Milestone has been achieved and paid in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(i)_. If such PMA is issued after
December 31, 2022, but on or before December 31, 2023, Parent shall pay to
the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Company Securityholders pursuant
to their respective Pro Rata Shares, an amount equal to $140,000,000 (reduced
to $115,000,000 pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(i)_ if the Interim
Success Milestone has been achieved and paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.12(a)(i)_) _minus_ the amount equal to _the product of_ $140,000,000
(reduced to $115,000,000 pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(i)_ if the
Interim Success Milestone has been achieved and paid in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(i)_) and one-twenty fourth (1/24) times the number of
full calendar months elapsed between the expiration of the PMA Milestone
Initial Period and the date on which such PMA is issued (the amount paid under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(ii)_ the " _PMA Milestone Consideration_ ", and
the time period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the date on
which the PMA Milestone Consideration is paid to the Exchange Agent, the "
_PMA Milestone Period_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, if the FDA requires
a post-approval or post-market study following issuance of such PMA approval,
such study would not disqualify achievement of the PMA Milestone pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(ii)_ and Parents obligation to pay to
the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Company Securityholders pursuant
to their respective Pro Rata Shares, the PMA Milestone Consideration.

 

(iii) _CPT Milestone_. In the event that, on or before December 31, 2025
(the " _CPT Milestone Initial Period_ "), the American Medical Association
approves a Medicare Category 1 Current Procedural Terminology Code (" _CPT_ ")
(the " _CPT Milestone_ ," and together with the Interim Success Milestone and
the PMA Milestone, the " _Milestones_ ") for the LARIAT System for the
Indication, Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the
Company Securityholders, pursuant to their respective Pro Rata Shares,
$120,000,000, payable in shares of Parent Common Stock (determined based on
the Parent Market Price as of the date of achievement of such CPT Milestone)
or cash, in its sole discretion, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.12(e)_. If such
CPT is issued after December 31, 2025, but on or before December 31, 2026,
Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Company
Securityholders pursuant to their respective Pro Rata Shares, an amount equal
to $120,000,000 _minus_ the amount equal to _the product of_ $120,000,000 and
one-twenty fourth (1/24) times the number of full

 



-40- 

    

 calendar months elapsed between the expiration of the CPT Milestone Initial
Period and the date on which such CPT is issued (the amount paid under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)(iii)_ the " _CPT Milestone Consideration_ ", and,
collectively with the Interim Success Milestone Consideration and the PMA
Milestone Consideration, the " _Milestone Consideration_ ," and the time
period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the date on which the
CPT Milestone Consideration is paid to the Exchange Agent, the " _CPT
Milestone Period_ ").

 

(iv) _Late Payment_. If the Exchange Agent does not receive payment of any
Milestone Consideration due to the Company Securityholders on or before the
specified due date therefor in this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, simple interest
shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to the Company Securityholders until
the date of payment to the Exchange Agent at the per annum rate of fifteen
percent (15%) or the maximum rate allowable by Law, whichever is lower. All
such accrued interest shall be payable in cash. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that any Milestone Consideration is due and payable
to the Company Securityholders, but not received by the Exchange Agent on or
before the specified due date therefor in this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, the
applicable Parent Market Price used for purposes of calculating
such Milestone Consideration shall be equal to the lower of (A) the Parent
Market Price at the time of achievement of the applicable Milestone and (B)
the Parent Market Price at the time of Parents actual payment of the
Milestone Consideration. In the event that the Securityholder Representative
incurs any costs (including attorneys fees) in connection with enforcement of
the Company Securityholders rights hereunder, Parent shall reimburse the
Securityholder Representative for all such expenses.

(v) _Reductions_. For the avoidance of doubt and consistent with
the provisions set forth in Section 2.12(b), the amount of any Milestone
Consideration payable to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company
Securityholders as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)_ shall be reduced
by (i) the amount of any Milestone Management Bonus related to such Milestone
Consideration payment, (ii) the amount of any Guggenheim Payment related to
such Milestone Consideration payment, (iii) the amount of any Additional
Reserve funded and not yet repaid prior to such Milestone Consideration
payment and (iv) the amount of any Set-off Amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.12(g)_.

 

(b) _Milestone Notice_. Within ten (10) Business Days after the
achievement of any Milestone, Parent shall deliver to the Securityholder
Representative notice of the achievement of the Milestone (each, a "
_Milestone Notice_ "), which shall include a breakdown of the percentage of
the associated Milestone Consideration payment that will be made in Parent
Common Stock and the percentage of the associated Milestone Consideration
payment that will be made in cash. As promptly as practicable (but in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days following Parents delivery to
the Securityholder Representative of a Milestone Notice, the Company
Securityholders shall deliver an updated Merger Consideration Schedule to the
Securityholder Representative and Parent, which shall include, in addition to
the information set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(e)_, (i) the amount of the
Milestone Consideration payable to the individuals set forth on _Schedule 2_
pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated Management Incentive Plan in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Milestone Management Bonus_
"), (ii) any amounts due to Guggenheim Partners in respect of services
rendered to the Company in connection with the Transactions that become due as
a result of the achievement of such Milestone (a " _Guggenheim Payment_ "),
(iii) any amounts funded as Additional Reserve and (iv) an allocation of the
applicable Milestone Consideration Payment (less the Milestone Management
Bonus, any Guggenheim Payment and any Additional Reserve) among the

 



-41- 

    

 Company Securityholders, determined in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Companys Organizational Documents as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. All payments under this _Section_ __
_ 2.12_ _(b)_ shall be made in accordance with any such updated Merger
Consideration Schedule delivered by the Company Securityholders to the
Securityholder Representative and Parent with respect to the Milestone that
has been achieved. Within ten (10) days following the delivery of an updated
Merger Consideration Schedule by the Company Securityholders to the
Securityholder Representative and Parent, Parent shall pay the respective
Milestone Consideration by (i) in the case of the Milestone Management Bonus,
by delivering or paying to the Surviving Company an amount equal to the
Closing Management Bonus for distribution to the individuals set forth on 
_Schedule 2_ through the Surviving Companys payroll payment system (in each
case subject to applicable withholding Taxes), (ii) in the case of any
Guggenheim Payment, by delivering to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to
Guggenheim Partners in accordance with the Merger Consideration Schedule, and
into the Exchange Account, cash in the amount of such Guggenheim Payment,
(iii) in the case of repayment of any Additional Reserve, by delivering to the
Exchange Agent, for distribution to the applicable Significant Holders in
accordance with the Merger Consideration Schedule, and into the Exchange
Account, cash in the amount of such Additional Reserve, and (iv) in the case
of the other payments, by delivering to the Exchange Agent, for distribution
to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the Merger Consideration
Schedule, either stock certificates (or evidence of book-entry positions)
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)_ hereof or depositing with the Exchange Agent, and
into the Exchange Account, cash to make all cash payments set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)_ hereof. Parent shall be able to rely on, and shall
have no liability to any party to this Agreement or to any Company
Securityholder for any payment reflected on, any updated Merger Consideration
Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding anything
set forth to the contrary in the Merger Consideration Schedule, Parent shall
make all payments to Non-Accredited Securityholders in cash rather than Parent
Common Stock.

 

(c) _Limitations_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Interim Success
Milestone, the PMA Milestone Consideration and the CPT Milestone
Consideration shall each be payable only once upon the first achievement of
the corresponding Interim Success Milestone, PMA Milestone or CPT Milestone,
and no amounts shall be due or payable for subsequent or repeated
achievement of the Interim Success Milestone, PMA Milestone or CPT Milestone.
Each of Parent, the Company and the Securityholder Representative hereby
acknowledges that the achievement of each Milestone is uncertain and therefore
Parent does not guarantee to Company, the Company Securityholders and the
Securityholder Representative that Parent will be required to pay any
Milestone Consideration.

 

(d) _Parent Obligations_.

 

(i) _ _Parent Diligence Obligations__. Subject to the other terms of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(d)_, Parent, as the sole member of the Surviving
Company, and the board of managers of the Surviving Company, shall have sole
discretion over all matters relating to the Surviving Company and the LARIAT
System after the Effective Time, including any research, development,
regulatory, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and sales decisions.
Although Parent has a present intention to continue the operations of the
Surviving Company (including the development, marketing, manufacturing,
distribution and sale of the LARIAT System and efforts to seek PMA and achieve
the CPT Milestone), the Parties acknowledge that Parent has no obligation to
operate the Surviving Company (or to operate its own business, or cause its

 



-42- 

    

 Affiliates to operate their respective businesses) in order to cause the
achievement of any of the Milestones; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
hereby agrees that during the applicable Milestone Periods (i) it will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and will cause its Affiliates and
(sub)licensees and any (sub)licensees sublicensees to use similar efforts, to
achieve the Milestones, (ii) it shall not take any actions in bad faith
concerning the operations of the Surviving Company with the intention of
avoiding Parents obligations to make payment of any Milestone Consideration
hereunder, and (iii) it shall not discontinue the development (including the
regulatory activities associated therewith) marketing, manufacturing,
distribution or sales of the LARIAT System, or withdraw the PMA for the LARIAT
System, during the applicable Milestone Periods if it does not possess
a valid commercial, developmental, regulatory or legal reason for doing so
(which reason may not be solely to avoid payment of the Milestone
Consideration) (collectively, the " _Parent Diligence Obligations_ ").

 

(ii) _Diligence Reports_.

 

(A) Until the expiration of the PMA Milestone Period without payment of the
PMA Milestone Consideration, beginning at the start of calendar year 2020
Parent shall provide to the Securityholder Representative reasonably detailed
semi-annual written reports in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ _F_ (on
or about each August 15th and on or about each February 15th) detailing the
commercialization and development activities with respect to the LARIAT System
completed during the past six (6) month reporting period and anticipated to
be undertaken during the next six (6) month period, in each case, by, as
applicable, Parent, its Affiliates, its (sub)licensees or any (sub)licensees
sublicensees. Parent shall cause its senior officers from its development
operations to be reasonably available to the Securityholder Representative to
answer questions related to the matters required to be discussed in each
report required pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(d)(ii)(A)_. __

(B) Following achievement of the PMA Milestone, until the expiration of
the CPT Milestone Period without payment of the CPT Milestone Consideration,
Parent shall provide to the Securityholder Representative reasonably detailed
semi-annual written reports in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit _ _F_ (on
or about each August 15th and on or about each February 15th) detailing the
commercialization and development activities with respect to the LARIAT
System completed during the past six (6) month reporting period and
anticipated to be undertaken during the next six (6) month period, in each
case, by, as applicable, Parent, its Affiliates, its (sub)licensees or
any (sub)licensees sublicensees. Parent shall cause its senior officers from
its development operations to be reasonably available to the Securityholder
Representative to answer questions related to the matters required to be
discussed in each report required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.12(d)(ii)(B)_.

(e) _Payments in Stock or Cash_.

(i) Each Milestone Consideration payment required to be made by Parent to
the Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)_ will be made
in Parent Common Stock to the extent necessary so that the Company
Securityholders receive no less than forty-five percent (45%) of the value of
each Milestone Consideration payment in the form of Parent Common Stock,
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the total number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issued as Milestone Consideration exceed 19.9% of the
total 

 



-43- 

    

 shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding as of the date hereof, which is
equal to 7,719,907 shares (the " _Share Cap_ "), which limitation shall
control in the event that issuance of forty-five percent (45%) of a Milestone
Consideration payment in Parent Common Stock would result in issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock under this Agreement in excess of the Share Cap
and, in such event, the balance of such Milestone Consideration payment will
be made in cash; and provided further, that all payments to Non-Accredited
Securityholders will be made in cash. In the event that payment in cash to
Non-Accredited Securityholders in accordance with the foregoing sentence
would result in a failure to meet the forty-five percent (45%) threshold,
payment of the Milestone Consideration to the Company Securityholders other
than the Non-Accredited Securityholders shall be adjusted to ensure that the
forty-five percent (45%) threshold will be met in the aggregate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Milestone Consideration payment required
to be made by Parent to the Company Securityholders pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 2.12(a)_ will be made in cash to the extent necessary so that the Company
Securityholders receive an amount of cash at least equal to the amount of
interest imputed to such Milestone Consideration payment pursuant to section
483 of the Code. For this purpose, payment of Parent Common Stock that is
characterized as interest pursuant to section 483 of the Code shall not count
towards the forty-five percent (45%) threshold, and the assumed value of any
rights of Dissenting Shares shall be counted as non-stock consideration. In
determining the forty-five percent (45%) threshold pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.12(e)_, the opening value of Parent Common Stock shall be used if the
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ is issued
during the trading day and the closing value of Parent Common Stock shall be
used if the Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_
is issued after the close of the trading day.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Securityholders shall have
the right to elect to receive all or any portion of each Milestone
Consideration in cash rather than Parent Common Stock in the event of the
occurrence of the following events (as determined by the Company
Securityholders in their reasonable discretion): (A) Parent shall have (1)
been adjudicated as bankrupt or insolvent, (2) been the subject of an order
for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code or any bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation
law or statute of any other jurisdiction or foreign country, (3) made a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (4) had a receiver
appointed on account of the insolvency of Parent, (B) shares of Parent Common
Stock shall have been delisted from NASDAQ or (C) there shall have occurred a
Parent Material Adverse Effect that is continuing at the time when such
Milestone Consideration becomes due.

 

(f) _Transfer Restriction_. From the Effective Time until the earlier to
occur of the end of all Milestone Periods or the date on which all Milestone
Consideration has become due and payable (subject to any reduction thereof as
a result of the exercise of any right of set-off pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.12(g)_), neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall sell, assign,
transfer divest or otherwise dispose of all of its rights to develop or
commercialize the LARIAT System, including by way of merger or consolidation,
unless, as a condition to such sale, assignment, transfer, merger or
consolidation, the purchaser, assignee or transferee (as applicable) assumes
in writing all obligations of Parent set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.12_
with respect to the LARIAT System (subject to all limitations and
qualifications included in this Agreement with respect to such obligations),
including the obligation to pay, upon the achievement of any Milestone that
has not, prior to the date of such sale, assignment or transfer, been achieved
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, the applicable Milestone
Consideration payable with respect to such Milestone in accordance with the
terms hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may not transfer or
otherwise assign the rights to develop or commercialize the LARIAT System
pursuant to the previous sentence unless: (1) such transferee or assignee is
at least as creditworthy as Parent on the date of such transfer, (2) such
transferee or assignee shall have

 



-44- 

    

 affirmatively assumed all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Agreement,
(3) such transferee or assignee is able to fully satisfy and perform the
obligations hereunder, and (4) Parent shall have delivered evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Securityholder Representative that such
transferee shall be able to fully satisfy and perform all of the obligations
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be
permitted to transfer the rights to develop or commercialize the LARIAT System
to an Affiliate so long as Parent remains obligated under this Agreement,
including with respect to the Parent Diligence Obligations and all
payment obligations.

(g) _Set-off_. The obligation of Parent to pay any Milestone
Consideration shall be qualified by the right of Parent and the Surviving
Company to reduce or hold back the amount of any one or more of the Interim
Success Milestone Consideration, PMA Milestone Consideration and CPT
Milestone Consideration by (i) the amount of any Damages actually incurred or
suffered by Parent or the Surviving Company as a result of the matters set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.12(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), and (ii) the amount
that would be necessary to satisfy in full any then pending and unsatisfied or
unresolved matters set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.12(g)_ as if such
matters were resolved in favor of Parent, provided, that any amounts
described in clause (ii) are deposited by Parent into an escrow account and
released upon the joint written instruction of Parent and the Securityholder
Representative following final determination of such matters (either by
mutual agreement by Parent and the Securityholder Representative or final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction) (any such reduction of
Milestone Consideration pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(g)_, a " _Set-
off Amount_"). Any set-off pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(g)_ shall be
net of any insurance or other third party proceeds received by Parent with
respect to such matter (net of costs, expenses and Taxes incurred by Parent).

 

Section 2.13. _Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent shall either (i) file a shelf registration statement on Form
S-3 (except if Parent is not then eligible to register for resale the
Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case such registration shall be
on Form S-1 or another appropriate form as determined by the Parent in its
sole discretion in accordance with the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder and the Parent shall undertake to register such
Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as practicable following the
availability of such form) (including any amendments or supplements, a "
_Registration Statement_ ") and the prospectus forming part of such
registration statement in compliance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act
(including any amendments or supplements, a " _Prospectus_ ") or (ii) if
Parent already has an effective Registration Statement, file a Prospectus
under such effective registration statement, in either case, covering the
resale on a continuous basis of all of the Registrable Securities (as defined
below) held by recipients of Closing Merger Consideration that have
adequately and timely provided Parent, upon its written request, with all
stockholder information required under the Securities Act and the rules and
Laws promulgated thereunder to be included in the Registration Statement and,
in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable after the later of (i) the
Closing Date or (ii) the date of completion by the Companys auditor of its
review of the Companys financial statements required to be filed by Parent
pursuant to Article 3 or Article 11 of Regulation S-X (but in no event later
than ninety (90) days following such date). After the Closing, Parent and the
Company shall mutually cooperate in good faith with respect to the

 



-45- 

    

 completion of the financial statements referenced in the immediately
preceding sentence. The Parent Common Stock issued as Closing Merger
Consideration as well as any Parent Common Stock that may be issued in
connection with any adjustment pursuant to this Agreement, including with
respect to Milestone Consideration and any post-Closing adjustments are
referred to herein as the " _Registrable Securities_." In connection
with clauses (i) and (ii) of this subsection (a), Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective as soon as reasonably practicable and to remain effective as
provided herein. The number of Registrable Securities issued shall be
reserved for the benefit of the holders of Registrable Securities and covered
by the Registration Statement for the benefit of the holders of Registrable
Securities for the time periods set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and
file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration
Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective
until the earliest of (i) such time that all Registrable Securities covered by
the Registration Statement have been sold and (ii) such time that all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement may be sold
without restriction, including volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant
to Rule 144.

(c) Parent shall furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities such
number of copies, without charge, of such Registration Statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto, and Prospectus included therein, all
exhibits and other documents filed therewith and such other documents as such
Holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder
of Registrable Securities. Parent will keep the Securityholder Representative
advised in writing as to the initiation of the registration and as to the
effectiveness thereof.

(d) Parent may require each Holder of Registrable Securities as to which
any registration is being effected to furnish Parent with such information
regarding such Person that is necessary to satisfy the disclosure requirements
relating to the registration and the distribution of such securities under the
Securities Act and the rules and Laws promulgated thereunder as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request in writing. Each such Holder of
Registrable Securities shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any changes
in the information set forth in the Registration Statement after it is
prepared regarding the Holder of Registrable Securities. None of the
information supplied (or to be supplied) by or on behalf of any of the Company
Securityholders for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement or Prospectus will, at the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (or with respect to
any post-effective amendments or supplements thereto, at the time such post-
effective amendments or supplements become effective under the Securities
Act), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, a "
_Holder of Registrable Securities_ " refers solely to a holder of Registrable
Securities as of the Closing Date.

(e) Parent may, by two (2) days prior written notice to all the Holders of
Registrable Securities (each, a " _Blackout Notice_ "), (i) delay the filing
of the Registration Statement or a request for acceleration of the effective
date or (ii) suspend the Registration Statement after effectiveness and
require that the Holders of Registrable Securities immediately

 



-46- 

    

 cease sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, in each case
for a reasonable period of time that is no longer than fourteen (14) calendar
days, in the event that (A) Parent is engaged in any activity or transaction
or preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction that Parent
desires to keep confidential for business reasons or has other material
nonpublic information, if Parent determines in good faith that the public
disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in
connection with the Registration Statement would require at that time
disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations, negotiations
or information and such disclosure could result in imminent and material harm
to Parent or (B) any other event occurs that makes any statement of a material
fact made in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated
by reference therein, untrue or that requires the making of any additions or
changes in the Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein
not misleading; _provided, however_ , that at the time such Blackout Notice is
sent and during the entire delay or suspension period Parent shall be in
compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 of
the Securities Act. Parent shall not deliver a Blackout Notice more than two
(2) times in any twelve (12) month period. If Parent suspends the
Registration Statement and requires the Holders of Registrable Securities to
cease sales of shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.13(e)_ Parent shall,
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the termination of the
circumstance which entitled Parent to do so, take such actions as may be
necessary to file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
and give written notice to all Holders of Registrable Securities authorizing
them to resume sales pursuant to the Registration Statement. If as a result
thereof the Prospectus included in the Registration Statement has been amended
to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose
such revised Prospectus with the notice to Holders of Registrable Securities
given pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.13(e)_, and the Holders of
Registrable Securities shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to
the Registration Statement other than by means of such revised Prospectus.
Parent need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to any delay or
suspension in any notice to Holders of Registrable Securities and such Holders
of Registrable Securities agree to treat and keep the existence of such delay
or suspension, as the case may be, confidential.

 

(f) Parent shall cause all shares of Parent Common Stock received by
Company Securityholders to be listed on NASDAQ within one (1) Business Day
after (i) the Closing with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued at
the Closing, and (ii) the date of issuance with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in connection with any adjustment pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.11_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.12_.

 

(g) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with compliance
with its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, including all fees
and expenses in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, the
registering of the Registrable Securities, fees and expenses of compliance
with securities or "blue sky" Laws, transfer agent fees, the maintenance of
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and the continued listing of
the shares of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ, including all registration,
filing, qualification, printing, accounting and other fees and expenses
except that Parent shall not be responsible for the fees of the
Representatives of and counsel to, the Company Securityholders, including
those with respect to any review and preparation of the
Registration Statement (all of which shall be included in the Company
Transaction Fees or payable by the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of
the Company Securityholders) out of the Representative Reserve).

 



-47- 

    

(h) Parent shall, and the Company shall, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Company Securityholder that will receive
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby to enter into a Lock-Up and Liquidity Agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_.

Section 2.14. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder of Company Capital Stock who
has demanded and perfected a demand for appraisal of such holders shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the
Closing Date has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holders right
to such appraisal (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, but shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL. Parent shall be
entitled to retain any amount that otherwise would have constituted Aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending
resolution of the claims of holders of Dissenting Shares, and the non-
dissenting Company Securityholders shall not be entitled to any portion of
such retained amount.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.14(a)_, if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall lose such holders status as such (through
the failure to perfect or otherwise), then as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later, such Dissenting Shares shall
automatically be deemed to have been converted only into the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, promptly following the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares.

 

Section 2.15. _Withholding_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Laws. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted
to the proper Taxing Authority, the amount of such consideration shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 

Section 2.16. _Representative Reserve_. The Company Securityholders that
are party to that certain engagement letter with the Securityholder
Representative, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Significant Holders_ ")
shall be permitted to fund, at their reasonable discretion, additional amounts
(the " _Additional Reserve_ ") to the Securityholder Representative, which
Additional Reserve shall be used to increase the Representative Reserve. Any
such Additional Reserve shall be repaid to the applicable Significant Holders
out of any Milestone Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement.

release, public statement or public announcement which Parent determines is
required by applicable Law, stock listing requirements or rating
agency arrangements, in which case Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to consult with the Company (prior to the Closing) or the Securityholder
Representative (after the Closing) regarding the contents thereof prior to
issuing any such press release or making any such public statement or public
announcement and shall consider in good faith any comments proposed by the

anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after Closing and the public
announcement of the Transactions, the Securityholder Representative shall be

SECURITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 

Section 8.1. _Appointment; Duties_. By approving this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby or by executing and delivering a Letter of
Transmittal, each Company Securityholder shall have irrevocably authorized and
appointed the Securityholder Representative as such Persons representative,
agent and attorney-in-fact for all purposes in connection with this
Agreement and all agreements ancillary hereto and to act on behalf of such
Person with respect to this Agreement and to take any and all actions and make
any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Securityholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, including the exercise of the
power to:

 



-96- 

    

(a) give and receive notices and communications;

 

(b) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders or otherwise handle any other matters related to this
Agreement;

(c) execute and deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry
out the intent of this Agreement and any Transaction Document;

(d) make all elections or decisions contemplated by this Agreement and any
Transaction Document;

(e) engage, employ or appoint any agents or representatives (including
attorneys, accountants and consultants) to assist the Securityholder
Representative in complying with its duties and obligations; and

 

(f) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Securityholder
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and shall be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Company Securityholder by the Securityholder Representative, and on any
other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Company
Securityholder by the Securityholder Representative, as being fully binding
upon such Person. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative (after Closing) shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Company Securityholders. Any decision or action by the
Securityholder Representative hereunder, including any agreement between the
Securityholder Representative and Parent relating to the defense, payment or
settlement of any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall constitute a
decision or action of all Company Securityholders and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each such Person. No Company Securityholder shall have
the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same.
The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, including the power of attorney
granted hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled
with an interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more
Company Securityholders or by operation of Law.

 

Section 8.2. _Resignation_. The Securityholder Representative may resign at
any time, and may be removed for any reason or no reason by the vote or
written consent of a majority in interest of the Company Securityholders (the
" _Majority Holders_ ") according to each such Company Securityholders Pro
Rata Share in the Company. In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation
or removal of the Securityholder Representative, a new Securityholder
Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of the
Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Securityholder Representative shall be sent to Parent,
such appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such
consent or the date such notice is received by Parent; _provided_ , that until
such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to rely on the decisions and actions of the prior
Securityholder Representative as described in _Section 8.1_ above.

 



-97- 

    

Section 8.3. _Liability_. The Securityholder Representative shall incur
no liability of any kind to the Company Securityholders with respect to any
actions or omissions taken by the Securityholder Representative in connection
with the Securityholder Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except to the extent such
actions shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have constituted gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel, accountants and other professionals and experts retained by the
Securityholder Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). The
Company Securityholders shall severally and not jointly (in accordance with
their Pro Rata Share in the Company), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Securityholder Representative from and against, compensate it for, reimburse
it for and pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, actions, damages, costs and expenses, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs, all
expenses of document location, duplication and shipment and disbursements,
arising out of or in connection with the Securityholder Representatives
execution and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ "), in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;  _provided_ , that in the event
any such Representative Loss or any portion thereof is finally adjudicated to
have been primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct
or bad faith of the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder
Representative shall reimburse the Company Securityholders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith. If not paid directly to
the Securityholder Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such
Representative Loss may be recovered from: (i) the funds in the Representative
Reserve, (ii) the funds in the Escrow Account at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Securityholders and
(iii) the Milestone Consideration at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Company Securityholders; _provided_ , that
while this section allows the Securityholder Representative to be paid from
the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company
Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it
at law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification
obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties
otherwise applicable to, the Company Securityholders set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided
to the Securityholder Representative under this section. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Securityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. The
Company Securityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on
the Representative Reserve and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Securityholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Securityholder Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Representative Reserve other
than as a result of its gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or bad
faith. The Securityholder Representative will hold these funds separate from
its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
after the date on which the final obligation of the
Securityholder Representative

 



-98- 

    

 under this Agreement has been discharged or such other date as the
Securityholder Representative deems appropriate, the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver any amounts remaining in Representative Reserve
to the Exchange Agent, for further distribution to the Company Securityholders
in accordance with their Pro Rata Share in the Company. For tax purposes, the
Representative Reserve will be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the Company Securityholders at the time of
Closing.

Section 9.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. This
Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in contract or
in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. With respect to any action or claim arising out of or
relating to the Transactions contemplated hereby or any document or instrument
delivered in connection therewith, the parties hereto hereby expressly and
irrevocably (a) agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States District Court located in the State of Delaware (and in
the absence of federal jurisdiction, the parties consent to be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in the State of Delaware),
(b) agree not to bring any action related to any transaction contemplated
hereby or any document or instrument delivered in connection therewith in any
other court (except to enforce the judgment of such courts), (c) agree not to
object to venue in such courts or to claim that such forum is inconvenient

 



-101- 

    

 and (d) agree that notice or the service of process in any proceeding shall
be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 9.6_. Final judgment by such courts shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any manner permitted by applicable Laws.

 

Section 9.8. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 9.9. _Parties in Interest_. None of the provisions of this
Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to any employee,
creditor or other Person other than Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the
Company, the Securityholder Representative and their respective successors and
assigns (if any).

 

Section 9.10. _Expenses_. Except as set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto will bear its own costs and Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions herein contemplated,
including all legal, accounting, investment banking and other Expenses
incurred by it or on its behalf, whether or not such transactions
are consummated. Parent shall be responsible for all transfer, sales, use,
real property transfer, recording, documentary, stamp, registration, share
transfer and other similar Taxes and fees imposed in connection with the
Transactions.

 

Section 9.11. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and the Parent, Merger Sub 1
and Merger Sub 2, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other
under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without bond or other security being required. The pursuit of
specific enforcement by any party hereto will not be deemed an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether
at law or in equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time.

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.
The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, on
the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, as applicable, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent

 



-102- 

    

 breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Company or Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger
Sub 2, as applicable, under this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree
that by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other
form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __
_ 9.11_ are not available or otherwise are not granted.

 

Section 9.12. _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Goodwin Procter LLP
(" _Goodwin_ ") has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Company
Securityholders and the Company and its Affiliates prior to the Closing, and
that Goodwin intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the Company
Securityholders after the Closing, each of the Parent and the Surviving
Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to
waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Goodwin representing
any of the Company Securityholders, the Securityholder Representative and/or
their Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to the
Parent or the Transactions. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between any Company Securityholders and its
Affiliates in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation
of the Transactions shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to such Company Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not
the Parent or the Surviving Company). Accordingly, the Parent and the
Surviving Company shall not have access to any such communications, or to the
files of Goodwin relating to engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after
the Closing, (i) the applicable Company Securityholders and their Affiliates
(and not the Parent or the Surviving Company) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the
Parent or the Surviving Company shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent
that files of Goodwin in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the applicable Company Securityholders and their Affiliates (and
not the Parent or the Surviving Company) shall hold such property rights and
(iii) Goodwin shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Parent or the Surviving Company
by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Goodwin and the Parent
or Surviving Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between the Parent or the Surviving Company and a third
party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Company (including on behalf of
the Parent) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Goodwin to such third party; _provided,
however_ , that neither the Surviving Company nor the Parent may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Representative, on behalf of the Company Securityholders.

 

Section 9.13. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by facsimile, "
_portable document format_ " (PDF), electronic transmission or otherwise) by
all of the parties hereto.
