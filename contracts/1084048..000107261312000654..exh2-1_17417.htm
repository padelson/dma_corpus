2.2 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.

  

  

(a) The Company shall prepare an estimated balance sheet as of the Closing
Date (the "Preliminary Balance Sheet") and deliver such Preliminary Balance
Sheet to Buyer at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" means any day other than a
Saturday, a Sunday, federal holiday or a day on which banks in the State of
California or New York are authorized or obligated by law to close. The
Preliminary Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions
of "Working Capital", "Debt", and "Company Transaction Expenses" as set forth
in this Agreement and on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP") and the accounting
methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles
used in the preparation of the Company's audited financial statements. The
Preliminary Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
president or chief financial officer of the Company to the effect of the
preceding sentence and shall be accompanied by a calculation of Debt, Working
Capital of the Company, and Company Transaction Expenses, certified by the
Company's president or chief financial officer.

  

  

(b) The Purchase Price will be reduced dollar-for-dollar to the extent of any
(i) Debt on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, (ii) Company Transaction Expenses
on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, and (iii) to the extent the Working Capital
on the Preliminary Balance Sheet is less than $1,000,000.

  

  

(c) Within 90 days following the Closing, Buyer will prepare a final closing
balance sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a final calculation of the
Company Transactions Expenses, Debt and Working Capital as of the Closing
Date. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the
definitions of "Working Capital", "Debt", and "Company Transaction Expenses"
as set forth in this Agreement and on a basis consistent with GAAP and the
accounting methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Company's audited financial
statements. The process described in this Section 2.2(c) is not intended to
permit the introduction of different accounting methodologies, practices,
estimation techniques, assumptions and principles to the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet from those used in the Company's audited financial
statements, except as may be expressly provided for in the definitions set
forth herein. The Seller Representative may dispute the calculation of the
Company Transaction Expenses, Debt and Working Capital by Buyer; provided,
however, that the Seller Representative will have notified Buyer of the
dispute, specifying the estimated amount thereof in dispute and setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 calendar days
after the day the Seller Representative receives the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of the Company Transaction Expenses, Debt and Working Capital.
Any items in the calculation of the Company Transaction Expenses, Debt and
Working Capital not disputed by the Seller Representative and not otherwise
subject to adjustment as a result of the resolution of the items in dispute
shall be deemed to be final and conclusive with respect to such items. In the
event of a dispute, the Seller Representative and Buyer will attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any written resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
If the Seller

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 3 -  

  

 

 

 

  

Representative and Buyer are unable to reach a resolution within 30 calendar
days after the receipt by Buyer of the Seller Representative's written notice
of dispute, the Seller Representative and Buyer will submit the items
remaining in dispute for resolution to Deloitte LLP (the "Independent
Accounting Firm"), which shall, within 30 calendar days after such submission,
determine and report to the Seller Representative and Buyer upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Seller Representative, Sellers and Buyer. The scope of the
retention of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to resolving the
disputes presented to it and matters related thereto and in no event shall
the resolution of any issue be outside the parameters or amounts which were
determined by Buyer and Seller Representative unless consented to by both
parties. In connection with the resolution of any dispute, each of Buyer and
the Seller Representative (on behalf of Sellers) will bear its own legal and
accounting fees and expenses. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Sellers on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand. Each of Buyer and the Seller Representative will cooperate
with and timely respond to any requests for information from the Independent
Accounting Firm in connection with any dispute pursuant to this Section
2.2(c).

  

  

(d) The Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Company Transaction
Expenses, Debt and Working Capital delivered by Buyer will be final and
binding on the parties for the purposes of this Section 2.2 upon the earliest
of (i) the failure of the Seller Representative to notify Buyer of a dispute
within 30 calendar days of the receipt by the Seller Representative of the
Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), by the Seller Representative and Buyer and (iii) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.2(c), by the Independent
Accounting Firm.

  

  

(e) If Debt as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet is greater than Debt as
shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, then the Purchase Price will be
decreased by the amount of such difference. If Debt as shown on the Closing
Balance Sheet is less than Debt as shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet,
then the Purchase Price will be increased by the amount of such difference. If
the amount of Company Transaction Expenses as shown on the Closing Balance
Sheet is greater than the amount of Company Transaction Expenses as shown on
the Preliminary Balance Sheet, then the Purchase Price will be decreased by
the amount of such difference. If the amount of Company Transaction Expenses
as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet is less than the amount of Company
Transaction Expenses as shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, then the
Purchase Price will be increased by the amount of such difference. If Working
Capital as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet is less than both $1,000,000 and
Working Capital as shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, then the Purchase
Price will be decreased by (x) the lesser of Working Capital as shown on the
Preliminary Balance Sheet and $1,000,000 minus (y) the Working Capital as
shown on the Closing Balance Sheet. If Working Capital as shown on the Closing
Balance Sheet is greater than Working Capital as shown on the Preliminary
Balance Sheet, then the Purchase Price will be increased by (x) the lesser of
Working Capital as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet and $1,000,000, minus
(y) Working Capital as shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet. All payments
will be made together with interest at 5% compounded daily beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the date of payment. If payment is due from Sellers
to Buyer pursuant to this subsection, then Buyer shall look only to the
Adjustment and Indemnity Escrow Amount for such payment.

  

  

(f) The term "Debt" shall mean: (i) every obligation of the Company for money
borrowed; (ii) every obligation of the Company evidenced by bonds, debentures,
notes or other similar instruments, including obligations incurred in

reimbursement obligation of the Company with respect to letters of credit,
bankers' acceptances or similar facilities issued for the account of the

deferred purchase price of property or services (provided that deferred
purchase price obligations under the Earnout Agreement (defined below) shall
not be considered "Debt" for any purpose under this Agreement); (v) every
capital lease obligation of the Company; and (vi) every obligation of the type
referred to in clauses (i) through (v)

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 4 -  

  

 

 

 

  

of another Person which the Company has guaranteed or for which the Company is
responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, as obligor, guarantor or
otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, "Debt" shall not include deferred
subscription liabilities or any liabilities to the extent included in the
calculation of Working Capital.

  

  

(g) The term "Working Capital" shall mean: (i) current assets of the Company
minus (ii) current liabilities of the Company, in each case containing line
items substantially consistent with the line items in the Company's Latest

the Company's ordinary course of business and consistent with its past

of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially
less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company. The cost of
the DandO Tail shall be a reduction to Working Capital as shown on the
Preliminary Balance Sheet. Buyer shall cause the Company to maintain such
policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger

otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.2(b)(i)

Parties shall be entitled to recover all such Damages, including the Threshold
Amount and (y) unless the Damages suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons in
connection with any individual item exceeds an amount equal to $2,000 (it
being understood that such Damages suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons

Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 7.3(g) shall constitute Damages.

(a) An Indemnified Person may seek recovery of Damages by delivering to the
Seller Representative, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Person, or to Buyer,
in the case of a Seller Indemnified Person (with a copy simultaneously
provided to the Escrow Agent in the case of a claim by any Buyer Indemnified
Person), written notice of such claim (each a "Claim Notice"). The date of
such delivery of a Claim Notice is referred to herein as the "Claim Date". The
Claim Notice shall (i) state that an Indemnified Person has paid, sustained,
incurred or accrued Damages and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail based on
the information then available, the individual items of Damages included in
the amount so stated and the general nature of the indemnifiable matter to
which such item is related.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 32 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Buyer, in the case of a claim by a Seller Indemnified Person, or the
Seller Representative, in the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person,
may object to a claim for indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice by
delivering to the Buyer Indemnified Person or to the Seller Indemnified Person
seeking indemnification (and, in the case of a claim against the Adjustment
and Indemnity Escrow Amount, to the Escrow Agent) a written statement of
objection to the claim made in the Claim Notice (an "Objection Notice"),
provided, that to be effective, such Objection Notice must (A) be delivered
to Buyer or to the Seller Representative, as applicable (and, in the case of a
claim for recourse against the Adjustment and Indemnity Escrow Amount, to the
Escrow Agent) prior to midnight (California time) on the twentieth (20th) day
following the Claim Date of the Claim Notice (such deadline, the "Objection
Deadline") and (B) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections
to the claims in respect of which the objection is made.

  

  

(c) In case Buyer or the Seller Representative, as applicable, timely delivers
an Objection Notice, Buyer or the Seller Representative, together with the
Buyer Indemnified Person or the Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable,
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If Buyer or the Seller Representative
reach an agreement with the Buyer Indemnified Person or the Seller Indemnified
Person, as applicable, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions
from the Adjustment and Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms
thereof.

  

  

(d) The parties shall provide each other with such information, records and
other documentation in such party's possession as is reasonably necessary and
appropriate in attempting to resolve such objection, subject in all cases to
the right of each party to withhold such information as reasonably necessary
to preserve attorney-client privilege and the confidentiality of competitively
sensitive information.

  

  

(e) If Buyer or the Seller Representative, as applicable, does not object in
writing to the claims contained in a Claim Notice prior to the Objection
Deadline for such Claim Notice, such failure to so object shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by all parties that the Buyer Indemnified Person or
the Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, is entitled to the full amount
of the claims for Damages set forth in such Claim Notice, and, in the case of
indemnification by Sellers of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, the Escrow Agent
shall make distributions from the Adjustment and Indemnity Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of such Claim Notice and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

7.6 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

  

  

(a) An Indemnified Person shall give the Seller Representative written notice,
in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Person, or to Buyer, in the case of a
Seller Indemnified Person (each, a "Claims Notice") of any claim, assertion,
event or proceeding for Damages by or in respect of a third party as to which
such Indemnified Person may request indemnification hereunder as soon as is
practicable and in any event within 30 days of the time that such Indemnified
Person learns of such claim, assertion, event or proceeding; provided,
however, that the failure to so notify the Seller Representative or Buyer, as
applicable, shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to the
extent that Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, are actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 33 -  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, shall have 30 days
after receipt of such Claims Notice to notify in writing the Indemnified
Person that it intends to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of
its own choosing and at its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof,
and such Indemnified Person shall cooperate with it in connection therewith;
provided, however, that the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable,
may not undertake, conduct or control such settlement or defense unless the
Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, acknowledges such Indemnified
Person's right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
further, that the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, shall not
have the right to assume the defense in connection with such Claims Notice if
(i) the Claims Notice seeks only an injunction or other equitable relief, (ii)
the Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel there are one or
more legal or equitable defenses available to the Indemnified Person that are
different from or in addition to those available to the Seller Representative
or Buyer, as applicable, and, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified
Person, that counsel for the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable,
could not adequately represent the Indemnified Person's interests because they
conflict with those of the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable,
(iii) such Claims Notice primarily involves any matter beyond the scope of the
indemnification obligations of Sellers or Buyer or (iv) the Seller
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, shall not have assumed the defense of
such Claims Notice in a timely fashion.

  

  

(c) If the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, elects to assume the
defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Seller Representative or Buyer,
as applicable, shall consult with the Indemnified Person for the purpose of
allowing the Indemnified Person to participate in such defense, but in such
case the expenses of the Indemnified Person shall be paid by the Indemnified
Person. An Indemnified Person shall provide and shall cause the Seller
Representative or Buyer and the Company, as applicable, to provide the Seller
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, and its respective counsel
with access to its records and personnel relating to any such claim,
assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall
otherwise cooperate with the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, in
the defense or settlement thereof. If the Seller Representative or Buyer, as
applicable, elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, an
Indemnified Person shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim
or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the Seller
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, consents in writing to such payment or
unless the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 7.6(c), withdraws from the defense of such asserted
liability or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or
on behalf of the Seller Representative or Buyer, as applicable, is entered
against an Indemnified Person for such liability. If the Seller Representative
or Buyer, as applicable, fails to defend or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Seller Representative or Buyer, as
applicable, fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, an Indemnified
Person shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof. If
the Indemnified Person assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding
pursuant to this Section 7.6 and proposes to settle such claim or proceeding
prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal with respect
thereto, then the Indemnified Person shall give the Seller Representative or
Buyer, as applicable, prompt written notice thereof, and the Seller
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, shall have the right to participate in
the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding,
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 7.6 and that in the event
of settlement, the Seller Representative's or Buyer's consent thereto, as
applicable, shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned.

  

  

7.7 REMEDIES EXCLUSIVE. From and after the Closing, the rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons to indemnification relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to recovery against
the then-remaining portion of the Cap on the terms contained in this Section 7
(except with respect to Special Items and breach of covenants), and such
indemnification rights shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer
Indemnified Persons subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to any matter
in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection
herewith (except

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 34 -  

  

 

 

 

  

with respect to the Special Items and breach of covenants). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the existence of this Section 7 and of the
rights and restrictions set forth herein do not limit any legal remedy against
the parties hereto to claims based on the fraud of the Person against whom
such remedy is sought; provided that the maximum liability of any Seller for
Damages hereunder, whether resulting from fraud or otherwise, shall not exceed
the actual amount of consideration received thereby pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (provided that nothing contained in this Section 7.7 shall
limit the joint and several liability of the Majority Sellers pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)).

  

  

7.8 TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. To the extent permitted by law, all
payments made pursuant to this Section 7 shall be treated as adjustments to
the Purchase Price for tax purposes, and such agreed treatment shall govern
for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

8. SELLER REPRESENTATIVE

  

  

8.1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. By signing this Agreement, each Seller shall be deemed to
have irrevocably constituted or appointed the Seller Representative as the
representative, and by execution of this Agreement, the Seller Representative
hereby accepts such appointment, to act on behalf of Sellers as their agent
and attorney in-fact, with full power of substitution, to act in their name,
place and stead in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The power of attorney granted in this Section 8.1 by each Seller is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated by the Seller
Representative and shall survive the death or incapacity of any Seller. Buyer
is entitled to rely on the actions of the Seller Representative taken on
behalf of Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. By signing this Agreement, each Seller shall be deemed to have
authorized the Seller Representative, on their behalf and in their name to:

  

  

(a) have the full and exclusive power and authority to act for and on behalf
of each Seller in any and all capacities and to do and perform every act and
thing required or permitted to be done, in the reasonable judgment of the
Seller Representative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

  

  

(b) receive all notices or documents given or to be given to Sellers pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith and to receive and accept service of legal
process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement;

  

  

(c) engage counsel and such accountants and other advisors for Sellers and
incur such other expenses on behalf of Sellers in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as the Seller
Representative may deem appropriate;

  

  

(d) take such action on behalf of Sellers as the Seller Representative may
deem appropriate in respect of the following:

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

any claims (including settlement thereof) made by any Buyer Indemnified Person
for indemnification pursuant to Section 7;

   
---|---

any amendment to this Agreement that is permitted under Section 9.8;

take such other action as the Seller Representative is authorized to take
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 35 -  

  

 

 

 

  

    

(iv)

  |  

receive all documents or certificates or notices, make all determinations and
give all consents and waivers on behalf of Sellers required under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(v)

  |  

represent each Seller or all or certain Sellers as a group in all litigation
and negotiate or enter into settlements and compromises relating to any
disputes arising in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(vi)

  |  

take all relevant action in all such other matters as the Seller
Representative may deem necessary or appropriate to consummate this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

8.2 EXPENSES OF THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE. The Seller Representative shall be
entitled to withdraw cash amounts held in the account containing the Seller
Representative Expense Amount in reimbursement for out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors' fees and expenses,
if applicable) incurred by the Seller Representative in performing under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the Seller
Representative Expense Amount is insufficient to cover the fees and expenses
incurred by the Seller Representative in performing under this Agreement,
each of the Common Equityholders shall be obligated to pay their Pro Rata
Share of any such deficiency. Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller
Representative shall be entitled to deduct any such fees and expenses in
excess of the then-remaining portion of the Seller Representative Expense
Amount from any amounts payable to the Common Equityholders in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

8.3 INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLER REPRESENTATIVE. The Common Equityholders shall
indemnify the Seller Representative for and shall hold the Seller
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the
Seller Representative or any of its affiliates and any of their respective
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling
persons, in each case relating to the Seller Representative's conduct as
Seller Representative, including all out-of-pocket expenses incurred for
legal fees or otherwise, other than losses, liabilities or expenses resulting
from the Seller Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct in
connection with its performance under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
The costs of such indemnification (including the costs and expenses of
enforcing this right of indemnification) shall be first deducted from the
Seller Representative Expense Amount and shall thereafter be individual
obligations of the Common Equityholders based on their Pro Rata Share of such
costs, which obligations may be satisfied as contemplated by Section 8.2. The
Seller Representative may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely
on the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Seller Representative in accordance with such advice, the Seller
Representative shall not be liable to Sellers or the Escrow Agent or any
other person. In no event shall the Seller Representative be liable hereunder
or in connection herewith for (a) any indirect, punitive, special or
consequential damages or (b) any amounts other than those that are satisfied
out of the Escrow Funds.

  

  

8.4 REASONABLE RELIANCE. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Seller Representative shall be entitled to (a) rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and
signed by any Common Equityholders or any party hereunder and (b) assume that
any Person purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions
hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

9.5 JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS. For purposes of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto hereby (i) consents to service of process in any legal
action, suit or proceeding among the parties to this Agreement arising in
whole or in part under or in connection with the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement in any manner permitted by law, (ii) agrees that
service of process made in accordance with this Section 9.5 or made by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 9.4 will constitute good and valid service of
process in any such legal action, suit or proceeding and (iii) waives and
agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any
such legal action, suit or proceeding any claim that service of process made
in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid
service of process. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the State of New York, Borough of
Manhattan, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court
sitting in the Southern District of the State of New York in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought
and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any
other party with respect thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 38 -  

  

 

 

 

  

9.6 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each
other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other such
other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other
party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of
this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  

  

9.7 WAIVER. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party
in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in
the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on
one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of
the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action
without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement.

  

  

9.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter and
constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a
complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended
except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the
amendment.

  

  

9.9 ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. No party may assign
any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
parties, except that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this Agreement
to any affiliate of Buyer (provided that any such assignment shall not relieve
Buyer of its obligations hereunder). Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the
benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. This Agreement
and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns,
except as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section
6.2 and Section 7 with respect to the Persons specified therein.

  

  

9.10 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

  

  

9.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of (a) the
State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws principles for corporate
matters and (b) the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts
of laws principles for contract matters.

  

  

9.12 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity.

9.13 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all
of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.
