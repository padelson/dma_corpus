has been no Seller Material Adverse Change, nor has there been any event or
condition of any character which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Seller Material Adverse Change in the future. _Schedule 3.1(f)_ sets forth a
list of all (x) inventory purchased or sold outside the ordinary course of
business since October 31, 2006, (y) other properties and assets (other than

Statement of Net Debt will be prepared in accordance with GAAP from the books
and records kept by the Companies and will be true and correct in all respects
as of the close of business on the business day prior to the Closing Date.
The Financial Statements reflect an 

   ##### 

  

    

adequate reserve established in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes (as
hereinafter defined) payable by the Companies for all Taxable periods and
portions thereof accrued through the respective dates of such Financial
Statements. Deficiencies for Taxes that have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against the Companies that have not been fully paid are fully
reflected as a Liability (as hereinafter defined) in the
Financial Statements, except to the extent such deficiencies are being
contested and an adequate reserve therefor has been established and is fully
reflected in such Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. 

   

 (g) _Undisclosed Liabilities_. To Sellers Knowledge, none of the Companies has any liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever, including any liabilities arising out of any illegal or concealed conditions, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and there is no basis for any present or future action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand against it giving rise to any liability or obligation, except for those (i) reflected or reserved on the Balance Sheets or (ii) incurred or accrued since October 31, 2006 consistent with past practices and in the ordinary course of business in transactions involving the purchase or sale by the Companies of goods and services in amounts which do not exceed $25,000 in any single instance or $250,000 in the aggregate or which do not extend for a period of more than three months, and consistent with the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement. To the extent a liability or obligation is not disclosed on  _Schedule 3.1(g)_ but would otherwise be required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to the requirements of a representation or warranty included in this Article III other than this _Section 3.1(g)_ but for the fact that such liability or obligation does not exceed a materiality or dollar threshold set forth therein, such liability or obligation will not be deemed to violate this _Section 3.1(g)_. 

   

 (h) _Accounts Receivable_. All Accounts Receivable of the Companies have been reflected properly on the books and records of the Companies in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and have been generated in the ordinary course of business from bona fide transactions.

To Sellers Knowledge, there is no right or claim of any counterclaim or set-off against any Accounts Receivable currently outstanding other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business. None of the Companies has experienced or suffered undue delay in its payment of its liabilities and obligations to its trade creditors (including suppliers) or debt. For purposes of this Agreement, "Accounts Receivable" means, collectively, all accounts receivable (including royalties receivable) of the Companies or otherwise relating to the Business, any payments received with respect thereto after the Closing Date, unpaid interest accrued on any such accounts receivable and any security or collateral relating thereto.

   #####

the Financial Statements. The value at which each of the Companies
inventories is carried on the Financial Statements reflects the lower of cost

inventories reflects write-offs or write-downs for damaged or obsolete items
or items of below standard quality consistent with the historical practices
of the Companies.

 7.7 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. 

   

 (i) At Buyers option, Individual will join with Buyer in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding election under state or local law with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares of any of the S Corps hereunder (with respect to each S Corp, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election" and collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections")). Buyer will notify Individual in writing of each Section 338(h)(10) Election within two months after the Closing. With respect to each S Corp for which Buyer notifies Individual of its election to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election, Buyer will prepare and provide to Individual an IRS Form 8023, which Individual will then sign and return to Buyer within 30 days after receiving notification from Buyer regarding each such Section 338(h)(10) Election, and will take all other actions reasonably necessary to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including without limitation that Individual will include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on Individuals Tax Return to the extent required by Law. 

   

 (ii) Individual will cooperate with Buyer and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer such information and documentation as Buyer reasonably requests to calculate the value of the Tax benefits to Buyer of making the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and the amount of additional Taxes that would be owed by Individual and the S Corps as a result of making the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including without limitation information about the adjusted 

   ##### 

  

    

tax basis in the Shares of the S Corps and the adjusted tax basis of the
S Corps assets. 

   

 (iii) Whether or not a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made for any of the Companies, Individual will prepare and file the final federal income Tax Return (and any corresponding final state income Tax Returns) for each S Corp for its last taxable year as an S corporation (collectively, with respect to each S Corp, the "Final S Corp Income Tax Return"), and Individual will pay any Taxes shown as due on each such Final S Corp Income Tax Return (including any Tax imposed on the S Corp attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including (A) any Tax imposed under Section 1374 of the Code or any similar provision of state or local Law and (B) any state or local Tax imposed on the S Corps gain such as the 1.5% California corporate franchise Tax corporation (the "Section 338(h)(10) Tax"). Individual will cause each such Final S Corp Income Tax Return to be prepared and filed in accordance with applicable Law and consistent with past practices. Individual will permit Buyer to review and comment on each such Final S Corp Income Tax Return prior to filing. With respect to each S Corp for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made and no later than sixty (60) days prior to the due date for filing its Final S Corp Income Tax Return, Individual will provide to Buyer a draft schedule showing the amount of Section 338(h)(10) Taxes imposed on the S Corp (computed in accordance with the allocations made on the Second Allocation Schedule). During the thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by Buyer of such draft schedule, Individual and Buyer will meet and confer and attempt in good faith to agree upon the amount of the Section 338(h)(10) Tax due. If the parties cannot agree, the disagreement will then be submitted, as promptly as practicable, to an arbitrator pursuant to _Section 10.8_, whose decision as to such question or questions in dispute will (1) be reached within fifteen (15) calendar days after submission thereof, (2) be limited to choosing the position either of Individual or Buyer with respect to each disagreement, and (3) be final and binding upon Individual and Buyer. The fees of the accounting arbitrator will be borne by Individual, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, in such amount(s) as determined by the arbitrator pursuant to _Section 10.8_. Buyer will reimburse Individual for the amount of such Taxes within 10 days of the payment of such Taxes made with the filing of the Final S Corp Income Tax Returns. 

   

 (iv) Buyer will pay or cause to be paid to Individual, in cash, the amount of additional consideration necessary to cause the after-Tax net proceeds that Seller Holdco realizes from the sale of the CalPly Shares (treating Taxes incurred by Individual as a result of such sales as though such Taxes were incurred by Seller Holdco for purposes of calculating such after-Tax net proceeds to Seller Holdco) to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds that Individual would have received had Individual not transferred the CalPly Shares to Seller Holdco pursuant to the Restructuring and, instead, sold the CalPly Shares directly to Buyer without making a Section 338(h)(10) Election for CalPly (the "CalPly Tax Adjustment");  _provided_ , _however_ , in no event will the CalPly Tax Adjustment be a negative number. In calculating the CalPly Tax Adjustment, there will be taken 

   ##### 

  

    

into account only the effects upon Individual of realizing items of
income, gain, deduction, loss and expense arising out of the deemed sale of
assets under Treas. Reg. § 1.1361-5(b) resulting from the sale by Seller
Holdco of the CalPly Shares, as compared to the effects upon Individual of
realizing gain from the direct sale of CalPly Shares to Buyer without having
transferred the CalPly Shares to Seller Holdco pursuant to the Restructuring
(including without limitation realization of income, gain, deduction or loss
or change in character thereof). For avoidance of doubt, in each case the
calculations made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence will be made
disregarding any deduction, expense or loss realized by Seller Holdco or
CalPly to the extent attributable to amounts paid or payable pursuant to
_Section 1.5_. 

   

 (v) If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made with respect to any S Corp, Buyer and each of the S Corps, jointly and severally, will pay or cause to be paid to Individual, in cash, the amount of additional consideration necessary to cause the after-Tax net proceeds that Individual realizes from the sale of the Company Shares for all S Corps for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds that Individual would have received had no Section 338(h)(10) Election been made for any of such S Corps (the "S Corp Tax Adjustment");  _provided_ , _however_ , in no event will the S Corp Tax Adjustment be a negative number. In calculating the S Corp Tax Adjustment, there will be taken into account only the effects upon Individual of realizing items of income, gain, deduction, loss and expense arising out of the hypothetical sale of assets and liquidation resulting from the all the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, as compared to the effects upon Individual of realizing gain from a sale of Company Shares of the S Corps for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made without such Section 338(h)(10) Election (including without limitation realization of income, gain, deduction or loss or change in character thereof). 

   

 (vi) No later than April 10, 2008, Buyer and each of the Companies, jointly and severally, will pay or cause to be paid to Individual by wire transfer of immediately available funds the full amount the CalPly Tax Adjustment and the S Corp Tax Adjustment (collectively, the "Tax Adjustment"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , if a dispute regarding the amount of the Tax Adjustment is pending on April 10, 2008, then Buyer and each of the Companies, jointly and severally, will pay or cause to be paid to Individual by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) the undisputed portion of the Tax Adjustment no later than April 10, 2008 and (ii) any remainder of the Tax Adjustment within five days after resolution of any such dispute. The Tax Adjustment will be increased if required due to any final "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code and any corresponding provision of state or local Law), and the obligations of Buyer and each of the Companies to pay the Tax Adjustment will survive until the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation with respect to Individual and each S Corp for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made for all taxable years during which either Closing occurs or any portion of the Purchase Price or the Tax Adjustment is paid or payable. Within thirty (30) days after all Allocation Schedules have become final pursuant to _Section 7.7(b)_, Individual will deliver to 

   ##### 

  

    

Buyer a draft schedule computing the amount of the Tax Adjustment (as finally
determined pursuant hereto, the "Adjustment Schedule"). During the thirty
(30) calendar days following receipt by Buyer of such draft Tax Adjustment
Schedule, Individual and Buyer will meet and confer and attempt in good faith
to agree upon and finalize the Tax Adjustment Schedule. Within ten (10)
calendar days after the expiration of such 30-day period, Individual will
deliver to Buyer a further draft Tax Adjustment Schedule with any revisions
so agreed. Within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of such further draft
Tax Adjustment Schedule, Buyer will notify Individual whether Buyer concurs
or disagrees with such further draft Tax Adjustment Schedule and,
if applicable, Buyers disagreements. If such disagreements cannot be
resolved between Individual and Buyer within ten (10) calendar days after
delivery of such notice by Buyer to Individual, the disagreement will then be
submitted, as promptly as practicable, to an arbitrator pursuant to _Section
10.8_, whose decision as to such question or questions in dispute will (1) be
reached within fifteen (15) calendar days after submission thereof, (2) be
limited to choosing the position either of Individual or Buyer with respect
to each disagreement, and (3) be final and binding upon Individual and Buyer.
The fees of the accounting arbitrator will be borne by Individual, on the one
hand, and Buyer on the other hand, in such amount(s) as determined by the
arbitrator pursuant to _Section 10.8_. 

   

 (b) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Set forth on _Schedule 7.7(b)_ is an allocation schedule showing the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Company Shares for all the Companies (the "First Tax Allocation Schedule"). Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Individual, with respect to each S Corp for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made (and with respect to CalPly), an allocation schedule showing the allocation among the assets of each such S Corp (and CalPly) of the portion of the Purchase Price (and separately showing any and all other capitalized costs) allocated to that S Corp (and CalPly) under the applicable First Tax Allocation Schedule and the liabilities of such S Corp (and CalPly) taken into account as part of the consideration for the assets of such S Corp (and CalPly) in the hypothetical sale of assets pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and under Treas. Reg. 1.1361-5(b) in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and other applicable Law (as finalized pursuant hereto, the "Second Tax Allocation Schedule" and together with the First Tax Allocation Schedule, the "Allocation Schedules"). Any amount paid to Sellers out of Escrowed Funds will be allocated to good will and going concern value of CalPly. The allocations set forth in the Second Tax Allocation Schedule will be binding upon Sellers except to the extent (i) determined otherwise pursuant to a final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or corresponding provisions of state or local Law, as applicable) or (ii) Sellers receive a written opinion of a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm to the effect that compliance with the Second Tax Allocation Schedule would subject Sellers to Tax penalties. Buyer and Sellers will report and file Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such Allocation Schedules. Sellers and Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each other with such information and documentation as reasonably required to prepare any Allocation Schedule. Neither Buyer nor Sellers will take any position (whether in audits, Tax 

   ##### 

  

    

Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Allocation Schedules
unless required to do so by Law. 

   

 (c) _Information Reporting_. On or before the Closing Date, Sellers will provide Buyer with all information needed by Buyer to comply with the reporting provisions of new Section 6043A of the Code and Buyer will timely prepare and file all reports required thereunder consistent with such information provided by Sellers and the Allocation Schedules. 

   

 (d) _Tax Returns_. Buyer will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns (other than the Final S Corp Income Tax Returns and any other income Tax Return for any S Corp for any taxable year or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, as to which the provisions of _Section 7.7(a)_ apply) for each of the Companies required to be filed ending after the Closing Date. In connection therewith, Sellers will be responsible for and reimburse Buyer for any Taxes for which Sellers have agreed to indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)(iv)_ and _(v)_. In the case of Tax Returns for periods starting before and ending after the Closing Date, Buyer will provide Sellers with an opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns no less than 15 days prior to the due date thereof and will make such revisions as may be reasonably requested by Sellers. In addition to the Final S Corp Income Tax Returns and the other income Tax Returns of the S Corps for any taxable year ending on or before the Closing Date, Sellers will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by each of the Companies on or before the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Companies and Sellers will cooperate fully, to the extent reasonably requested by another party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will include (i) the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding, (ii) making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, (iii) furnishing the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request relating to Taxes for which either of the parties is entitled to Indemnification, and (iv) in the case of any federal, state, county, local or foreign Tax audit claim or assessment relating to any payroll withholding Tax liability asserted against any of the Companies, promptly seeking abatement of liability pursuant to Section 3402(d) of the Code (and, in that connection, requesting each affected employee to provide an affidavit or other proof that the relevant compensation was included in taxable income and any applicable Taxes thereon were paid), making filings required for adjustments without interest pursuant to Section 6205(a)(1) of the Code, and taking appropriate action under similar provisions of state or local law. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Companies, on the other hand, will (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority, and (ii) give the other party 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if such other party so requests, the party giving
such notice will allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records. 

   

 (f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Companies and any Person other than the Companies will be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Companies will not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, whenever any Taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or for which Sellers are otherwise responsible, Buyer will promptly inform Sellers, and Sellers will have the right to control any resulting administrative and judicial proceedings or determinations and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or for which Sellers are otherwise responsible. Whenever any Taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or for which Buyer is otherwise responsible, Buyer will have the right to control any resulting administrative and judicial proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or for which Buyer is otherwise responsible. 

   

 (h) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers will be liable for, and will timely pay, any and all gains, transfer, sales, use, bulk sales, recording, registration, documentary, stamp and other Taxes that may result solely from the transfer of Shares of the Companies to Buyer hereunder (other than any such Taxes that are payable as a result of making a Section 338(h)(10) Election). 

   

 (i) _Refunds_. Except to the extent any such refund was reflected as an asset on the Financial Statements as of Closing, all refunds of Taxes for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (other than Taxes that Buyer is responsible to pay under this Agreement) will belong to Sellers, and any such refund received by or credited to Buyer will be promptly paid by Buyer to Sellers. 

   

 (j) _Timing Adjustments_. If (i) a Section 338(h)(10) Election is not made with respect to a Company (and in any event to the extent relevant with respect to California corporate franchise tax) and (ii) the Tax liability of any of the Companies and/or Sellers for a taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date is increased or decreased because of the correction of the timing of an item of income, deduction, or credit, which when corrected produces a Tax benefit or detriment available to Buyer, any of the Companies or a successor to any of the Companies after the Closing Date, Buyer will pay to Sellers, or Sellers will pay to Buyer, as the case may be, from time to time, without duplication, upon receipt, payment, or application of all or any portion of such 

   ##### 

  

    

Tax benefit or detriment or portion thereof by Buyer, any of the Companies or
any successor of any of the Companies, an amount equal to such Tax benefit or
detriment or portion thereof received, paid or applied. 

   

 (k) _S Election/Qsub Election_. Prior to Closing and pursuant to the Restructuring, Sellers will file a "protective" S election for Seller Holdco and a qualified subchapter S subsidiary election for CalPly, which (with the transfer by Seller Trust of the CalPly Shares to Seller Holdco) Sellers will treat for Tax purposes as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code so that Seller Holdco will be treated as a continuation of CalPly and CalPlys original S election will be treated as never having terminated. To the extent not received from the IRS prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will promptly provide Buyer with a copy of the IRS acknowledgment of such elections following their receipt from the IRS. 

   

 (l) _E Foam S Election Relief_. Prior to Closing, Sellers will file an application for relief under Rev. Proc. 2003-43, 2003-1 C.B. 998, so that E Foam will be a validly electing S corporation as of the Closing Date.

The parties acknowledge and agree that any such activity the primary purpose of which is to create an opportunity to make a claim for indemnification under Article IX hereto, or any other activity that cannot reasonably be justified absent Sellers obligations under Article IX hereof, will not be deemed to have a valid business reason. 

  

 7.9 _Executive Bonus_. Buyer will cause the Companies to pay Individual any employment-based bonus earned by Individual with respect to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007, and, in the event the Closing Date occurs after March 31, 2007, with respect to the period between March 31, 2007 and the Closing Date, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Executive Bonus Agreement of event date herewith between Individual and CalPly.

 (ix) the failure of the transfer by Seller Trust of the CalPly Shares to Seller Holdco pursuant to the Restructuring (along with the election by CalPly to be treated as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code) to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F); 

   

 (x) any claims by any Affiliate of any Seller against any of the Companies or their respective directors and officers arising out of or relating to events, circumstances, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing; and 

   

 (xi) any litigation, action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand by any employee or former employee in respect of any success, severance, stay or similar bonus paid or payable as a result of the Transaction. 

   

 For purposes of _Section 9.2(a)(v)_, with respect to any period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, (A) liability for any Taxes determined by reference to 

   ##### 

  

    

income, capital gains, gross income, gross receipts, sales, net profits,
windfall profits or similar items or resulting from a transfer of assets will
be allocated between the part of the period ending on or before the Closing
Date and the part of the period thereafter based on a closing of the books as
of the end of the Closing Date; and (B) liability for all other Taxes will be
allocated between the part of the period ending on or before the Closing Date
and the part of the period thereafter, pro rata based on the number of days
in the Taxable period; _provided_ , _however_ , that no part of any
Taxes described in this clause (B) will be allocated to the part of the
period ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent attributable to any
asset acquired after the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) _Environmental Liabilities Indemnification by Sellers_. 

   

 (i) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 9.2(b)_ and notwithstanding any notification by Sellers to Buyer or any of the Companies prior to the Closing, or any prior knowledge of Buyer or any of the Companies, Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and the Companies harmless from and against any and all (A) Environmental Liabilities and (B) Damages incurred by Buyer or any of the Companies arising out of, or relating to, any breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.2_. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Buyer or the Companies from or against any Environmental Liability to the extent such Environmental Liability (A) has been caused by any negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of Buyer or, post-Closing, any of the Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that any construction, erection, removal, repair, maintenance, demolition, alteration, modification or relocation of the Leased Real Property, the other assets of the Companies or the Business will not be considered "acts, negligent omissions, negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct" under this _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ if such activities are performed (other than at the request of Buyer) or required to be performed by the owner of the facility (if other than Buyer), Sellers (or any Affiliate of any Seller) or any Former Shareholder, (B) arises out of, or relates to, any Environmental Condition at a Leased Real Property that is not the subject of a Related Party Lease that does not arise out of, or relate to, the operations of the Companies at such Leased Real Property on or prior to the Closing Date or (C) has been discovered or identified as a result of a breach of _Section 7.8_. 

   

 (iii) From and after the Closing, as long as Sellers have an obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this _Section 9.2(b)_ and provided that the Litigation Conditions (as hereinafter defined) are satisfied, Sellers will control all Remedial Action and negotiations with any Governmental Authority in respect of all Environmental Conditions. Any such Remedial Actions with respect to which Sellers will have an indemnification obligation hereunder (a "Covered Remedial Action") will be performed in a commercially reasonable manner, including, to the extent allowed or authorized by applicable Environmental Law or the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over a Covered Remedial Action, the use of applicable numeric or narrative standards to which Hazardous Materials in, 

   ##### 

  

    

on or around land must be remediated as established pursuant to
Environmental Laws by the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such
land. Sellers will select consultants and contractors to implement such
Covered Remedial Action (not reasonably objected to by Buyer). Sellers, their
consultants and their contractors will be allowed, during normal business
hours and upon Buyers consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), to implement such Covered Remedial Action and to the extent such
use would not unreasonably interfere with Buyers or the Companies business,
use, at Sellers cost and during normal business hours and upon Buyers
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), any
systems, equipment or utilities at such location reasonably necessary to
conduct any Covered Remedial Action, including but not limited to any
systems, equipment and utilities reasonably necessary for the proper or
effective operation of any remedial system (including the sanitary sewer
system and those systems necessary for the supply of gas, water, compressed
air and electricity). Buyer will provide Sellers and their environmental
consultants, if any, with copies of all non-privileged Environmental Reports,
analytical data, correspondence, directives, orders and documents
submitted to or received by Buyer or any of the Companies from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Covered Remedial Action, and
other non-privileged documents created or received by or on behalf of Buyer
or any of the Companies in connection with the Covered Remedial Action. 

   

 (iv) Buyer will inform Sellers promptly in writing of any Environmental Condition or Environmental Claim in respect of which Sellers may have an indemnification obligation under this _Section 9.2(b)_, and Sellers will inform Buyer promptly in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information, notice of violation or other document relating to any Environmental Condition or Remedial Action with respect to the Facilities, whether civil, criminal or investigative; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure of a party to give such notice will not adversely affect the partys rights under this Agreement except to the extent (if any) that the party who is not promptly informed will have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

 9.3 _Certain Limitations on Claims for Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) _Time Limitations_. 

   

 (i) The right of Buyer to indemnification under _Section 9.2_ will apply only to those claims for indemnification which are given pursuant to this Agreement on or before the respective dates set forth below: 

   

 (A) Any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ relating to any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in  _Sections 3.1(x)_ or _3.3_ (to the extent any such representation and warranty set forth in _Section 3.3_ relates to compliance with the Code), or any claim for indemnification under  _Sections 9.2(a)(iv)_, _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ ,  _(viii)_ or _(ix)_  

   ##### 

  

    

will be made on or before 90 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) applicable to any claim
arising in connection with any breach of any such representations and
warranties or the subject of such indemnity. 

   

 (B) No time limit will apply to any right to indemnification under  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ relating to any breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Sections 3.1(a)_, _(b)_ or _(c)_ , subsections _(i)_ , _(ii)_ or part (A) of _(iii)_ of  _Section 3.1(e)_ or _Section 3.1(k)(ii)_ (each such section or subsection, as the case may be, an "Unlimited Section" and collectively, the "Unlimited Sections"), _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 9.2(a)(viii)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(ix)_. 

   

 (C) Any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(i) _relating to any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in any subsection of _Sections 3.1_ or _3.3_ (or portion thereof) not referred to elsewhere in this _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ or under  _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ will be made on or before the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date. 

   

 (D) Any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2(b)_ will be made on or before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. 

   

 (ii) Any claims for indemnification under _Section 9.1_ for any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article IV will be made on or before the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a claim for indemnification under  _Sections 9.1_ or _9.2_ is made in a timely manner, the subsequent expiration of the survival period, if any, of the corresponding representation or warranty or right of indemnification will not affect the rights and obligations of the indemnified and indemnifying parties thereunder with respect to such claim. 

   

 (b) _Maximum and De minimis Amounts_. 

   

 (i) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnification which can be required of Sellers: 

   

 (A) under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ relating to any breach of any representation or warranty contained in the Unlimited Sections or  _Section 3.1(f)_ (with respect to the Statement of Net Debt),  _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 9.2(a)(x)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(xi)_ will not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price; 

   

 (B) under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ relating to any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in any section other than the Unlimited Sections will not exceed $28,000,000; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (C) under _Section 9.2(b)_ will not exceed $36,000,000;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date such limit will be reduced to an amount equal to (1) $28,000,000 plus (2) the total monetary amount of any claim for which Buyer has sought indemnification from Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ prior to such date. 

   

 (ii) Sellers will not be required to indemnify, defend or hold Buyer or the Companies harmless from and against any Damages under _Section 9.2(b)_ or  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty (other than a breach of any representation and warranty contained in an Unlimited Section or, with respect to _Section 3.1(f)_ as it pertains to the Statement of Net Debt), unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Damages equals $2,800,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which event Sellers will be obligated to indemnify Buyer and the Companies, and Buyer and the Companies may assert their right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such Damages exceed the Threshold Amount. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages incurred by a party seeking indemnification hereunder arising out of or resulting from, but not for purposes of determining whether there has occurred, any breach of a representation, covenant or agreement contained herein, references to an "Seller Material Adverse Change" or materiality (or other correlative terms) will be disregarded. 

   

 (c) _Exception to Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.3_ , the limitations set forth in _Sections 9.3(a)_ and _(b)_ will not apply with respect to any fraud or willful or intentional misrepresentation. 

   

 (d) _Payment of Damages_. If an amount is payable to Buyer pursuant to this Article IX, such amount will, (i) first, to the extent of available funds, be paid to Buyer by the Escrow Agent from the Escrowed Funds and, to the extent that the Escrowed Funds are insufficient, (ii) second, be paid to Buyer directly by Sellers in cash, by cashiers or certified check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. 

   

 (e) _Calculation of Damages_. The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided to any party pursuant to this Article IX will be calculated giving effect to (net of) (i) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party with respect to such Damages under any insurance policies of the Companies (and, with respect to claims for indemnification made by Buyer, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to inquire as to whether any such insurance policies provide coverage for the claim at issue and, if so, to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery thereunder) or from any third-party; (ii) any amounts specifically accrued or reserved for as a current liability or as a deduction from a current asset on the Balance Sheets with respect to such Damages; and (iii) the amount of any Tax benefits actually received (net of any Tax detriment suffered) by the indemnified party or its Affiliates (each a "Loss Reduction Amount"). If the amount of any Damages incurred by an indemnified party at any time subsequent to the making of a payment by an indemnifying party pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

    

this Article IX is reduced by a Loss Reduction Amount, the amount of such
Loss Reduction Amount (less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in
connection therewith) will promptly be repaid by the indemnified party to the
indemnifying party. Sellers hereby waive any and every claim for recovery
from Buyer for any and all Damages which Buyer recovers as a Loss Reduction
Amount. Sellers agree that the waiver hereunder will preclude the assignment
of any such claim by subrogation (or otherwise) to an insurance company
(or any other Person). 

  

 9.4 _Notice of Claim; Right to Participate in and Defend Third Party Claim_. If any indemnified party receives notice of the assertion of any claim, the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, or the imposition of any penalty or assessment by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), and the indemnified party intends to seek indemnity hereunder, the indemnified party will promptly provide the indemnifying party with notice of the Third Party Claim (including a copy of any related third party demand, claim or complaint). The failure by an indemnified party to notify an indemnifying party of a Third Party Claim will not relieve the indemnifying party of any indemnification responsibility under this Article IX, unless such failure adversely prejudices the ability of the indemnifying party to defend such Third Party Claim. The indemnifying party will have the right, exercisable by written notice to the indemnified party at any time following receipt of notice from the indemnified party of the commencement of or assertion of any Third Party Claim, at the sole expense of the indemnifying party, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim which involves (and continues to involve) solely monetary damages; _provided_ , that (a) the indemnifying party expressly agrees in such notice that, as between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , any amounts necessary to so discharge such Third Party Claim will first be recovered from the Escrowed Funds; and _provided_ , if the indemnifying party gives the indemnified party prompt written notice and an opportunity to participate in the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be deemed to have agreed to be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge (i) such Third Party Claim to the extent facts and circumstances arise subsequent to the date of such notice that indicate, in the reasonable judgment of the indemnifying party, that the indemnifying party would not be solely responsible, as between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, for the Damages resulting from such Third Party Claim or (ii) any additional claims brought in the same action against the indemnified party following the assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim; (b) the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim by the indemnifying party will not, in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, have a material and adverse effect on the continued operation of the indemnified partys business; (c) the timing of the assumption of the defense by the indemnifying party will not, in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, adversely prejudice the defense of such Third Party Claim; and (d) the indemnifying party makes reasonably adequate provision to ensure the indemnified party of the ability of the indemnifying party to satisfy and discharge such Third Party Claim in full ( _provided_ , any amounts necessary to so discharge such Third Party Claim will first be recovered from the Escrowed Funds) (the conditions set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) are collectively referred to as the "Litigation Conditions"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties in any action will include both an indemnifying party and an indemnified party, and, under the applicable rules of professional conduct, counsel would not be permitted to represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, the indemnified party will have the right to select separate counsel (in addition to local counsel solely for 

   ##### 

  

    

purposes of satisfying jurisdictional requirements) to participate in the
defense of such action on its behalf, at the expense of the indemnifying
party, to the extent such expenses are reasonable; and _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that the indemnifying party will forfeit the right to control the
defense or settlement of any such claim if, at any time after assuming the
defense or settlement thereof, the indemnifying party no longer satisfies
the Litigation Conditions. If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise
or defend the Third Party Claim, fails to notify the indemnified party of its
election as herein provided, or fails to satisfy the Litigation Conditions,
the indemnified party may pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim;
and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party will not
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the indemnified partys
prior written consent, unless (i) the terms of such settlement or compromise
release the indemnified party from any and all liability with respect to the
Third Party Claim, (ii) the indemnifying party will have available assets
(giving effect to the aggregate amount of Escrowed Funds then
available) sufficient to cover the full amount of any judgment or settlement
award payable in connection with such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the
indemnifying party will have acknowledged its obligations to indemnify the
indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim in accordance with
this Article IX. The indemnified party will be entitled (at the indemnified
partys expense) to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with
its own counsel. The parties agree to cooperate fully with each other and
their respective counsel in the defense against any Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 9.4_, if Seller is
the indemnifying party with respect to a Third Party Claim and such Third
Party Claim relates to any actual or alleged Environmental Liability
involving Hazardous Material not referred to in  _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_, the
indemnified party has the option to either (x) allow Seller to defend the
Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms and conditions of the preceding
sentence with counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (y)
defend such Third Party Claim, provided that all legal fees and costs of the
indemnified partys attorneys in connection with the defense will be paid by
such indemnified party and Sellers will not be obligated to indemnify
Buyer with respect to such fees and costs. In the event Sellers and Buyer
subsequently agree, in their reasonable discretion, to the addition of an
insurer to cover some or all of the potential liabilities hereunder, the
parties acknowledge that reasonable revisions to the provisions
herein related to defense of Third Party Claims may be necessary in order to
accommodate the insurer. 

  

 9.5 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payment under this Article IX will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for any Damages arising out of, or relating to, any breach of any representation or warranty contained in the Unlimited Sections or with respect to any fraud or willful or intentional misrepresentation, after the Closing has occurred, the right to indemnification under this Article IX will be the exclusive remedy of each party hereto in connection with any breach by the other party of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 9.7 _No Special Damages_. No party to this Agreement will have any liability for any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages (including loss of profit or revenue) suffered or incurred by any other party; except where a third party has claimed such damages. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE X. MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 10.1 _Amendments and Waivers_. Buyer and Sellers may, by mutual agreement, amend this Agreement in any respect, and any party, as to such party, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in representations and warranties by the other party; (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the covenants or agreements contained herein and performance of any obligations by the other party; and (d) waive the fulfillment of any condition that is precedent to the performance by such party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. To be effective, any such amendment or waiver must be in writing and be signed by the party providing such waiver or extension, as the case may be. Such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of any party hereto, such consent will be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this _Section 10.1_.

 10.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the Related Agreements, and all other agreements, documents and instruments delivered pursuant hereto incorporated herein, unless otherwise expressly provided therein, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without reference to the conflicts of laws rules of such state.

 10.8 _Arbitration_. 

   

 (a) Each party hereto, for itself and its successors and assigns, agrees that any dispute between the parties hereto with respect to any matter covered by or arising out of this Agreement will be submitted to binding arbitration, before one arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules (this "AAA Rules"), to occur in Los Angeles, California. Each party, for itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably waives any objection it may have now or hereafter to binding arbitration under the AAA Rules to occur in Los Angeles, California. Each party agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto in any venue other than arbitration. 

   

 (b) Each party is required to notify the other parties and the Escrow Agent, in writing, of any dispute. Notice of a dispute for which the party intends to initiate arbitration will be made by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to each party at its address set forth in _Section 10.4_ or at such other address of which the other parties have been notified in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.4_. Within ten days after receipt of a notice of a dispute for which the party intends to initiate arbitration, Buyer and Sellers will designate in writing one arbitrator to resolve the dispute; _provided_ , that if Buyer and Sellers cannot agree on an arbitrator within such ten-day period, the party that provided written notice of the dispute will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association and the arbitrator will be selected by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator so designated will not be an employee, consultant, officer, director or equity holder of any party hereto or any Affiliate of any party to this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) The parties will participate in the arbitration in good faith. Each such party will have the right to be represented by counsel. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA Rules; _provided_ , that the final arbitration decision is to be rendered as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than 180 days after first referral to the arbitrator, and the arbitrator will agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that this time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties and by the arbitrator, if necessary. 

   

 (d) The arbitrators decision and award will be made and delivered in writing to each party and the Escrow Agent and will set forth a reasoned basis for the decision, including any award of damages or finding of liability. The decision and award of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive upon all parties hereto. 

   

 (e) The prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with the arbitration, and the non-prevailing party will pay such fees. The non-prevailing party will also be responsible for the payment or reimbursement of the fees of the arbitrator and the costs and expenses of the arbitration. The arbitrator will determine which is the prevailing party for purposes of this _Section 10.8(e)_. The arbitrator will also determine the amount of "reasonable attorneys fees" to be awarded to the prevailing party.

 10.10 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are solely for convenience of reference and will not be given any effect in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 10.11 _Gender and Number_. The masculine, feminine or neutered gender and the singular or plural number will each be deemed to include the others whenever the context so indicates. 

  

 10.12 _Construction_. Buyer and Sellers have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Related Agreements. In the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and the Related Agreements will be construed as if drafted jointly by Buyer and Sellers, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Related Agreements. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law will be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The words "included," "includes," or "including" (or any other tense or variation of the word "include") in this Agreement will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or 

   ##### 

  

    

Section or Schedule, such reference will be to an Article or Section or
Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All accounting terms
used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement will have the meanings
determined by GAAP. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as to the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine
and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined
or referred to herein or in any document or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time

instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes. 

  

 10.13 _Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules_. All exhibits and schedules, including the Disclosure Schedule, annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule will be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item will not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself). Any information disclosed in a particular Schedule will not be deemed disclosed and incorporated into any other Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule except to the extent the applicability of the disclosure to such other Schedule is reasonably inferable from the disclosure made. Except to the extent set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to vary the definition of "Seller Material Adverse Change" or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party will use the fact, in and of itself, of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement; provided that nothing herein is intended to modify any determination with respect to (a) whether a representation, warranty or covenant in which such amount is set forth has been breached or defaulted upon or (b) one partys rights including rights to terminate or obtain indemnification as a result of such breach or default. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, except to the extent set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact, in and of itself, of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 10.14 _Conflict of Interest_. If any Seller so desires, and without the need for any consent or waiver by the Companies or Buyer, SMRH will be permitted to represent such Seller after the Closing in connection with any matter, including without limitation anything related to the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute
relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the
Closing, SMRH will be permitted to represent such Seller, any of his agents
and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any
negotiation, transaction or dispute ("dispute" includes litigation,
arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Buyer, the Company or any of
their agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as
claims for indemnification and disputes involving consulting or noncompetition
agreements or other agreements entered into by such Seller in connection with
this Agreement. Upon and after the Closing, the Companies will cease to have
any attorney-client relationship with SMRH, unless and to the extent SMRH is
specifically engaged in writing by a Company to represent such Company after
Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with
respect to such Seller or such Seller consents in writing at the time to such
engagement. Any such representation of such Company by SMRH after the Closing
will not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.
