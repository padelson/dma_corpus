AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
July 20, 2017, by and between BANK MUTUAL CORPORATION, a Wisconsin
corporation (the "Company"), and ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP, a Wisconsin corporation
("Buyer"). Unless defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in Exhibit A.

WITNESSETH

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") and the
board of directors of Buyer (the "Buyer Board") deem it advisable and in the
best interests of their respective corporations and such corporations
shareholders to consummate the merger of the Company with and into the Buyer
(the "Merger") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein
and in accordance with the provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation
Law (the "WBCL"). Buyer and the Company are sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Constituent Corporations" and Buyer, following the
effectiveness of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving
Corporation."

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the Buyer Board have approved the Merger upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and, in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the WBCL, approved and declared the
advisability of entering into this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Parties also agree to certain
prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions, in each case as
set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, the members of the Company Board have agreed to execute and deliver
to Buyer a voting agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recitals, the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained herein, and in
order to set forth the terms and conditions of the merger and the mode of
carrying the same into effect, the Parties, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows: ##### Table of Contents

  

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Buyer and the
separate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease, and Buyer shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Merger will have the effect set
forth in the WBCL, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger and, without
limiting the foregoing, all properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Constituent Corporations will vest in the Surviving
Corporation without reversion or impairment as provided under the WBCL. The
Surviving Corporation shall have all liabilities of the Constituent
Corporations as provided under the WBCL.

 

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective as
of the time and date of filing of the Articles of Merger, in a form consistent
with the provisions of this Agreement (the "Articles of Merger"), with the
Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions ("WDFI") in accordance with
the provisions of the WBCL or, if mutually agreed upon by the Parties, at the

CONVERSION OF SHARES

 3.1 _Consideration_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Buyer, the Company, or the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted,
subject to the fractional share procedures in Section 3.5, into the right to
receive 0.422 fully paid and nonassessable shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
Buyer Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock Consideration").

The total stock consideration to be paid by Buyer in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration".

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.1 to the contrary, at the Effective
Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in
the Companys treasury and each share of Company Common Stock owned directly
or indirectly by Buyer (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
connection with debts previously contracted) will be cancelled and no shares
of Buyer Common Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in
exchange therefor.

 3.2 _Exchange of Company Stock Certificates_.

(a) The Parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Wells Fargo Shareowner
Services or another bank or trust company designated by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to the Company shall serve, pursuant to customary terms of an
exchange agent agreement (the "Exchange Agent Agreement"), as the exchange
agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent"); and (ii) to
execute and deliver the Exchange Agent Agreement at or prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall authorize the issuance
of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article
III: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for payment of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, and (ii) sufficient cash
for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in
accordance with Section 3.5. Such amount of cash and shares of Buyer Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid
after the Effective Time, are referred to as the "Conversion Fund."

 



3 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) Within five (5) business days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or
more certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stock Certificates") a letter of transmittal and other appropriate
and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of Company Common
Stock (or rights related thereto) on the stock transfer books of the Company.

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Buyer
Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this Article III. Promptly after the surrender
of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article III, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.1.

(g) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation, or its successors in interest. Any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with
this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, or
its successors in interest, for issuance of Buyer Common Stock and/or cash
pursuant to the Merger Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of
any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such shareholders shares of
Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or
distributions on shares of such Buyer Common Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with
this Article III, shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration per share shall be adjusted
appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

3.3 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

3.4 _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, the shares of
Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be

Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock into which they were
converted pursuant to this Article III.

 

3.5 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall
be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Buyer
Common Stock pursuant to this Article III shall instead be entitled to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole
cent, determined by multiplying Buyer Common Stock Price by the fractional
share of Buyer Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be
entitled.

 

3.6 _Buyer Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Buyer, the Company, or the holder of any
shares of Buyer Common Stock, the shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

3.7 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be converted
automatically into an option (an "Adjusted Stock Option") to purchase, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including by giving effect to any
accelerated vesting as a result of the Merger), the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock
Option shall have an exercise price per share of Buyer Common Stock equal to
the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the Exchange
Ratio.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and vests upon the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms as in effect as of the date hereof
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, less applicable tax withholdings.

 



5 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) At the Effective Time, any Company Restricted Stock Award that
is outstanding as of the Effective Time and does not vest upon the Effective
Time in accordance its terms as in effect on the date hereof shall be
converted into an award of restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock with the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Restricted
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms),
and relating to the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to
the nearest whole share of Buyer Common Stock.

 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and
its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 3.7. Promptly after the Closing, Buyer shall register under the
Securities Act the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
Company Restricted Stock Awards.

 

3.8 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Exchange Agent, Buyer, and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted
or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

14 ##### Table of Contents

  

(ii) access to all books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (except employee medical records) and such other relevant
information and materials as may be reasonably requested (including the
ability to make copies and abstracts thereof); and

 

(iii) the opportunity to discuss the affairs of the Company with the
current senior officers of the Company who would reasonably be presumed to
have information which would be relevant for the purposes of planning for the
transition to Buyers ownership, upon prior notice to and approval of the
Company, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned except that the Company may require one of its representatives to
be present for any such meeting.

Buyer further agrees that all information derived by Buyer or any of the
Buyer Investigating Parties as a result of the above shall be governed by the
terms and conditions of that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement between the
Company and Buyer dated May 17, 2017 (the "Buyer NDA"). Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer nor any Buyer
Investigating Party may contact any customer, vendor, financing source, other
related party or any employee of any of the Companies without the express
written permission of the Company, other than in the ordinary course of
business.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such access or investigation shall not
interfere materially with the normal operations of the Companies. Upon
request, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries will furnish Buyer or its
representatives such financial and operating data and other information
reasonably requested by Buyer (provided, such disclosure would not result in
the waiver by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-
client privilege). This Section 5.3(b) shall not require the disclosure of any
information to Buyer the disclosure of which, in the Companys reasonable
judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement
including the prohibitions on disclosure of confidential supervisory
information; (ii) would result in the breach of any agreement with any third
party in effect on the date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or
threatened litigation or investigations, if disclosure might affect the
confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters being
discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply,
the Company and Buyer will make, to the extent legally permissible,
appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional
specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and
to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal Requirement.

(c) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
promptly furnish to Buyer: (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking laws or
federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on the
SECs EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy of each report filed by it or
any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other than
portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or examination
materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable Legal
Requirement.

5.4 _Schedules_.

 

(a) _Delivery of Company Schedules_. Contemporaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company is delivering certain schedules
described in this Agreement (collectively, the "Company Schedules") to Buyer.
The Company Schedules are incorporated by reference herein and are deemed to
constitute an integral part of this Agreement and to modify the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company, contained
in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Disclosure on Company Schedules_. If a document or matter is
disclosed in any Company SEC Report filed with, or furnished to, the SEC
prior to the date that is two business days prior to the date hereof (without
giving effect to any amendment to any such Company SEC Report filed on or
after the date that is two business days prior to the date of this Agreement)
and publicly available in full on the SECs Edgar system (excluding any
disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC Report in any risk factor
section, any forward-looking disclosure or any other statements that are
similarly predictive or primarily cautionary in nature), or on any Company
Schedule to this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be disclosed for all
purposes of this Agreement to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on
its face, without necessity of specific repetition or cross-reference;
however, the disclosure of such document or matter is not intended as a
representation or warranty as to the material nature of such document or
matter nor does it establish any standard of materiality upon which to judge
the inclusion or omission of other documents or matters in any such schedule
or constitute an admission of liability, guilt, violation or delinquency with
respect to any Contract, Legal Requirement or Authorization. All capitalized
terms used in any Company Schedule shall have the definitions specified in
this Agreement.

 

(c) _Notification_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the Company will promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence of any event
that would reasonably be expected to make the satisfaction of one or more of
the conditions in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, as applicable, impossible or unlikely;
provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(c) will
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice, or the representations or warranties of, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the Parties.

5.5 _Company Shareholders_ __ _Meeting_.

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date the Registration Statement is declared effective, take all action
necessary, including as required by and in accordance with the WBCL, the
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company and the Bylaws of the
Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company Shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite approval of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholder Approval"). The Company and the Company Board will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the votes in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement required by the WBCL and otherwise, including
by recommending that the Company Shareholders vote in favor of this
Agreement, and the Company and the Company Board will not withdraw, qualify or
adversely modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or
adversely modify) the Company 

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Boards recommendation to the Company Shareholders that the Company
Shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement (an
"Adverse Recommendation"). However, if, prior to the time the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside counsel, determines in good faith that (i)
(A) an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) a change
or effect has occurred following the date hereof, and (ii) in each case it is
reasonably likely that to continue to recommend this Agreement to its
shareholders in light of such Acquisition Proposal or change or effect would
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under the WBCL, then, in
submitting this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to
make an Adverse Recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended); _provided_ ,
that the Company Board may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i)
it gives Buyer at least three (3) business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including,
in the event such action is taken by the Company Board in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the
identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment
or modification thereof, or, in the event such action is taken by the Company
Board in response to a change or effect of the type referred to above not
involving an Acquisition Proposal, a description in reasonable detail such
other change or effect) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the
Company Board takes into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Buyer and the Company Board, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, determines in good faith that (A) in
the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (B) it remains reasonably likely that to
continue to recommend this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended) to
its shareholders in light of such Acquisition Proposal or change or effect
would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under the WBCL. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.5 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 5.5.

 

(b) Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation, the Company shall
adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting, if, as of the time for
which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date
of such meeting, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
Shareholders Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting, for the
purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation.

 

5.6 _Information Provided to Buyer_. The Company agrees that
the information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or to be provided by the Company in writing to Buyer specifically for
inclusion in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement and any other
documents to be filed with any Regulatory Authority in connection with

 



17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 the Contemplated Transactions will: (i) at the respective times such
documents are filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective and, with respect to the Proxy Statement, when mailed, not
be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (ii) in the
case of the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at
the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, not be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection with which the Proxy
Statement shall be mailed. The Company will have a duty to correct any
material misleading statement specified by the Company for inclusion, and so
included, in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement and any other
documents filed with any Regulatory Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any
information with respect to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates contained in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement or
in any document submitted to, or other communication with, any Regulatory
Authority.

5.7 _Operating Functions_. The Company and the Bank shall cooperate with
Buyer in connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of
the Parties; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing actions shall not unduly
interfere with the business operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

5.8 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than Buyer with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company will within two (2) business days advise Buyer following receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Buyer
reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
(including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a
reasonably current basis.

 

(b) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and
affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than contacting a Person for the sole purpose of seeking clarification
of the terms and conditions of an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
received after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval); provided that, in the event the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, from a Person other
than Buyer, after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, and the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably
be likely to result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering the advice
of outside

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 counsel, that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable law,
the Company may: (i) furnish information with respect to it to such Person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (subject to the requirement that any such information not previously
provided to Buyer shall be promptly furnished to Buyer); and (ii) participate
in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and (iii)
subject to the provisions of Section 5.5, effect an Adverse Recommendation.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

5.9 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. The Company will take such steps as may
be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of Company Common Stock
in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VI 

BUYER COVENANTS

 

6.1 _Operation and Maintenance of the Buyer Business_. Prior to
the Closing, unless the Company otherwise consents in writing, the Buyer will
and will cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with sound business practice, to keep in full force and effect its
existence and all material rights, franchises, proprietary rights and
contractual rights relating or pertaining to their business, and will not and
will cause its Subsidiaries not to:

 

(a) knowingly take any action that is intended to or would reasonably be
likely to adversely affect or materially delay the ability of the Parties to
obtain any necessary Requisite Regulatory Approval, the Company Shareholder
Approval, or to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or
the Bank Merger Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby; and

(b) amend its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or its Amended
and Restated Bylaws in a manner that would materially and adversely affect
the holders of Company Common Stock relative to other holders of Buyer Common

Companys request upon reasonable prior notice and at reasonable times, Buyer

may require one of its representatives to be present for any such meeting.

The Company further agrees that all information derived by the Company or any
of the Company Investigating Parties as a result of the above shall be
governed by the terms and conditions of the Buyer NDA. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor
any Company Investigating Party may contact any customer, vendor, financing
source, other related party or any employee of any of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries without the express written permission of Buyer, other than in
the ordinary course of business. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such access or investigation shall not
interfere materially with the normal operations of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries. Upon request, Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries will furnish
the Company or its representatives such financial and operating data and other
information reasonably requested by the Company (provided, such disclosure
would not result in the waiver by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries of any
claim of attorney-client privilege). This Section 6.2(b) shall not require the
disclosure of any information to the Company the disclosure of which, in
Buyers reasonable judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any applicable Legal
Requirement including the prohibitions on disclosure of confidential
supervisory information; (ii) would result in the breach of any agreement
with any third party in effect on the date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate
to pending or threatened litigation or investigations, if disclosure might
affect the confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the
matters being discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence
shall apply, the Company and Buyer will make, to the extent legally
permissible, appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal
Requirement.

 

(c) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer shall
promptly furnish to the Company: (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking
laws or federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on
the SECs EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy of each report filed by it
or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other
than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or
examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable
Legal Requirement.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless
(i) any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) any person who, while a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, is or
was serving an employee benefit plan because his or her duties to the Company
or to such Subsidiary also imposed duties on, or otherwise involved services
by, the person to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan
(each, an "Indemnified Party"), against any and all Losses, reasonable fees
(including reasonable attorneys fees), costs, charges, disbursements and
other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified
Party (collectively, "Expenses") in connection with any threatened, pending
or completed civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding, whether formal or informal, which involves
federal, state or local law and which is brought by or in the right of any
Person (any such action, an "Indemnification Proceeding") to which the
Indemnified Party was made a party by virtue of his or her service in any of
the capacities set forth above in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
6.6(a), to the extent that such Indemnified Party has been successful on the
merits or otherwise in the defense of such Indemnification Proceeding.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless
any Indemnified Party against any obligation to pay a judgment, penalty,
assessment, forfeiture or fine, or the agreement to pay any amount in
settlement of an Indemnification Proceeding, and pre- and post-judgment
interest related thereto, and any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with an Indemnification Proceeding, unless it shall be proven by
final judicial adjudication that such person breached or failed to perform a
duty owed to the Company or to any Subsidiary of the Company which
constituted: (i) a willful failure to deal fairly with the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, or the respective shareholders thereof in
connection with a matter in which the Indemnified Party had a material
conflict of interest, (ii) a violation of the criminal law, unless the
Indemnified Party had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful, (iii) a transaction from which the Indemnified Party derived an
improper personal benefit, or (iv) willful misconduct.

 

(c) Upon written request by an Indemnified Party who has been made party to
an Indemnification Proceeding, Buyer shall reimburse the Expenses of such
Indemnified Party as

 



22 ##### Table of Contents

  

 incurred if the Indemnified Party provides Buyer with all of the following:
(i) a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she did
not breach or fail to perform his or her duties to the Company and (ii) a
written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay to
Buyer such reimbursements if and to the extent that it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
for such amounts under the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in order for
any Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement,
such Indemnified Party must make a written request to Buyer. This written
request shall contain a declaration that Buyer shall have the right
to exercise all rights and remedies available to such Indemnified Party
against any other party arising out of or related to the Indemnification
Proceeding for which indemnification is being sought and that the Indemnified
Party has assigned to Buyer all such rights and remedies. Buyer shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Agreement if and to
the extent that such Indemnified Party has previously received indemnification
or allowance for Expenses from any party in connection with the same
Indemnification Proceeding.

(e) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time or, if such
term coverage is not available, such other maximum period of coverage
available, Buyer shall maintain a directors and officers liability insurance
policy or policies covering each Indemnified Party covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date
hereof, on and subject to terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
insureds than the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policy in effect as of the date hereof, for acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time; provided, that in no event shall Buyer be required to
expend in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the amount of
the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2017 for such
purpose (which amount is set forth in Schedule 6.6(e)) and, if Buyer is unable
to maintain such policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this
proviso, Buyer shall obtain a policy or policies of insurance with
substantially similar terms and conditions as may then be available, and with
an equal or lesser claims reporting time period as may then be available for
payment of such amount; provided further, that in lieu of the obligations of
this subsection, Buyer may request that the Company obtain, and upon such
request the Company shall obtain, at Buyers expense, such extended reporting
period coverage under the Companys existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time).

(f) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause proper
provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Buyer assumes the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

(g) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her legal
representatives.

6.7 _Board Representation_. On or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation and Buyer Bank at the Effective Time to

Company will advise Buyer, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any
request by the SEC to amend the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of
the other Party) as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC

any public statement or, except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic information to a third party,
concerning, the Contemplated Transactions without the prior consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the other Party; _provided,
however_ , that either Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party (but after prior consultation with the other Party to the extent
practicable under the circumstances), issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements or by stock exchange rules. Subject to the
foregoing, the Parties agree that the press release announcing the execution
and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of the Parties,

7.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation; Takeover Statutes_.

(a) Each of Buyer and the Company agrees to exercise good faith and use
its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions
to Closing in this Agreement, and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
as promptly as practicable. Neither Party will intentionally take or
intentionally permit to be taken any action that would be a breach of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, each Party will, and will cause each Subsidiary of that
Party, respectively, and all of their respective Affiliates and
representatives to, cooperate with respect to all filings that any Party is
required by any applicable Legal Requirements to make in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements and the instructions of any
Regulatory Authority, each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Contemplated Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other Party with
copies of notices or other written communications received by it or any of
its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory Authority with respect to such
transactions.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, none of Buyer, the Company or their
respective boards of directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure
the continued exemption of) the Contemplated Transactions from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Contemplated Transactions,
each Party and the members of their respective boards of directors will grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the Contemplated Transactions,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such
Takeover Statute.

 

7.5 _Reorganization_.

 

(a) The Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute
a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will
not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from so qualifying.
Following the Effective Time, neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer
knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take
any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure
to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason why
it would not be able to deliver to counsel, as of the date of the tax opinion
referred to in Section 4.3(g), a certificate substantially in compliance with
IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary
exceptions and modifications thereto (the "IRS Guidelines"), to enable counsel
to deliver such legal opinion, and the Company hereby agrees to deliver to
counsel such certificate effective as of the date of such opinion. 

(c) As of the date hereof Buyer does not know of any reason why it would
not be able to deliver to its counsel, as of the date of the tax opinion
referred to in Section 4.3(g), a certificate substantially in compliance with
the IRS Guidelines, to enable counsel to deliver such legal opinion
contemplated, and Buyer hereby agrees to deliver to counsel such certificate
effective as of the date of such opinion.

the Company, or use at least a significant portion of the Companys historic

under the Code.

 

7.6 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Covered Employees") shall
automatically become employees of Buyer as of the Closing. As of the Closing,
Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or as appropriate a Subsidiary
thereof) to assume and honor all Company Plans,  _provided_ that subject to
the provisions of this Agreement and the Company Plans, the Surviving
Corporation may amend or terminate the Company Plans as and to the extent
permitted in accordance with their terms; provided, however, that any such
amendment or termination shall not adversely affect benefits that have vested
under any such plan. Until the first anniversary of the Closing, for so long
as the Covered Employee remains employed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries, Buyer
shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that are at that time made available
to similarly-situated employees of Buyer under the benefit plans maintained by
Buyer or its Subsidiaries (the "Buyer Benefit Plans"); _provided, however,_
that until such time as Buyer shall cause Covered Employees to participate in
the Buyer Benefit Plans, continued participation in the Company Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in the Buyer Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Buyer Benefit Plan).

 

(b) For all purposes (other than purposes of benefit accruals) under the
Buyer Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees, each Covered
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same extent as
such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any
applicable Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated

 



27 ##### Table of Contents

  

 or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period of service or (ii) for purposes of any defined benefit
pension plan, any benefit plan that provides post-employment welfare benefits
or any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as
of the Transition Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that: (i) for purposes of each Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to any Covered Employee,
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such Buyer Benefit Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the Company Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable,
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date; and (ii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Company Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account
under such Buyer Benefit Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were
incurred during the plan year of the Buyer Benefit Plan in which the
Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Benefit Plan.

 

(d) For one year following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide severance benefits to any Covered Employee whose position is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (other than for
cause) as a result of the Transaction in accordance with Buyers severance
policy in effect for similarly situated employees of Buyer, or,
if applicable, the Surviving Corporation shall provide severance benefits to
such Covered Employee in accordance with any agreement between the Covered
Employee and the Company listed on Schedule 8.16(a). Further, the Parties
shall determine and establish a retention bonus program, consulting
arrangements or similar arrangements for certain Covered Employees who remain
employed through the Closing or at Buyer for an interim period following
Closing, subject to the terms set forth on Schedule 7.6(d). The Parties shall
mutually agree as to each employee eligible to receive a retention bonus or
consulting arrangement, the amount of each such retention bonus or consulting
arrangement, and the terms and conditions of each such retention bonus or
consulting arrangement. Buyer shall honor all existing employment agreements
or similar agreements of the Company and the Bank listed on Schedule 8.16(a).

 

(e) If requested by Buyer in writing at least thirty (30) business days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by the Company (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be
terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Buyer
requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Covered Employees
shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries, taking into account the service crediting provisions set forth
in Section 7.6(b). The Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that the
Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in
accordance with this Section 7.6(e); _provided_ , that prior to amending or
terminating the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall provide the form and
substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments to Buyer for review
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

thereof to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Plan, Buyer
Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or

hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock and the shares of Buyer Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

7.8 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of the Parties shall promptly notify
the other Party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer
or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Buyer, the Company, or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Company shall apprise Buyer of developments related to, and give Buyer the
opportunity to monitor at its own expense, the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed without Buyers prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is

statements of income and cash flows for the 3-month period ended on March 31,
2017 (including the notes thereto) (collectively, the "Buyer Financial
Statements"), as filed in the Company SEC Reports, were prepared from the
books and records of Buyer (which are accurate and complete in all material
respects) and in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto, or, in the case of interim or unaudited financial statements, normal
year-end adjustments and the absence of notes). The Buyer Financial Statements
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated statement of
income, changes in stockholders equity, cash flows and consolidated
financial condition of Buyer and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal
periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case
of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, neither

(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Buyer included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 (including any
notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2017, or in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) An accurate and complete copy of each Buyer SEC Report is publicly
available on the SEC Edgar system. No such Buyer SEC Report, at the time
filed, furnished or communicated, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not false or misleading, as of
such time. As of their respective dates, all Buyer SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive
officer of Buyer has failed in any respect to make the certifications required
of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(d) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer. Buyer (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Buyer, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Buyer by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Buyers outside
auditors and the audit committee of Buyers Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Buyers ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the
knowledge of Buyer, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyers internal
controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Buyers auditor and audit committee and a copy has been
previously made available to the Company. To the knowledge of Buyer, there is
no reason to believe that Buyers outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries,

had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Buyer, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or written claim that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Buyer or any of its officers, directors or employees to the Board of
Directors of Buyer or any committee thereof or, to the knowledge of Buyer, to
any director or officer of Buyer.

 9.7 _Recent Developments_. Other than pursuant to this Agreement or as
described in the Buyer SEC Reports, since January 1, 2017, no event or events
have occurred that have had or would reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.
