Exhibit 2.1

 

 _  SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT_

 

 This SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December
28, 2007, is by and among Gourmet Herb Growers, Inc., a Nevada corporation
(the " _Parent_ "), The Hong Kong Winalite Group Limited, a Hong Kong company
(the " _Company_ "), and the Shareholders of the Company identified on _Annex
A_ hereto (each, a " _Shareholder_ ", and together, the " _Shareholders_ ").
Each of the parties to this Agreement is individually referred to herein as a
" _Party_ " and collectively, as the " _Parties_."

 

 _  BACKGROUND_

 



 

 The Company has 48,000,000 shares of capital stock (the " _Company Stock_ ")
outstanding, all of which are held by the Shareholders. Each Shareholder is
the record and beneficial owner of the number of shares of Company Stock set
forth opposite such Shareholders name on _Annex A_ hereto. Each Shareholder
has agreed to transfer all of his, her or its (hereinafter " _its_ ") shares
of Company Stock in exchange for a number of newly issued shares of the Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Parent (the " _Parent Stock_ ") that
will, in the aggregate, constitute 96.5% of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Parent on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately after the
Closing. The number of shares of Parent Stock to be received by each
Shareholder is listed opposite each such Shareholders name on _Annex A_. The
aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock that is reflected on _Annex A_ is
referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ".

 

 The exchange of Company Stock for Parent Stock is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), as amended or such other tax free
reorganization exemptions that may be available under the Code.

 

 The Board of Directors of the Parent and the Company have determined that it
is desirable to effect this plan of reorganization and share exchange.

the Shareholder, enforceable against such Shareholder in accordance with the
terms hereof.

 

 Section 2.04

 

 _  No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder and the performance by the Shareholder of its obligations
hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof: (i) will not require the
consent of any third party or any federal, state, local or foreign government
or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or

certificate(s) representing or evidencing the Shares contain a customary
restrictive legend restricting the offer, sale or transfer of the Shares
except in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), or pursuant to an available exemption from registration, (ii) agrees

registration requirements of, the Securities Act, (iii) represents that the
Shareholder is now and will be at the time of the exchange contemplated by
this Agreement, outside the United States, (iv) has not engaged in or directed
any unsolicited offers to acquire the Shares in the United States, (v) is

902(a) and 902(c), respectively, of Regulation S of the Securities Act), (vi)
is acquiring the Shares for its own account and not for the account or benefit
of any U.S. Person, (vii) is the sole beneficial owner of the Shares and has
not pre-arranged any sale with a purchaser in the United States, and (ix) is
familiar with and understands the terms and conditions and requirements
contained in Regulation S, specifically, without limitation, the Shareholder
understands that the statutory basis for the exemption claimed for the
exchange of the Shares would not be present if the exchange, although in
technical compliance with Regulation S, is part of a plan or scheme to evade
the registration provisions of the Securities Act. 

   Section 2.07

 

 _  Investment_. The Shareholder is acquiring the Shares to be issued to the
Shareholder for investment for the Shareholders own account and not with the
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution, assignment or
resale within the meaning of the Securities Act or the securities law of any
applicable state to others and no other person has a direct or indirect
beneficial interest, in whole or in part, in such Shares. The Shareholder
understands that the Shares to be issued to the Shareholder have not been and
will not be registered under the Securities Act or qualified under the laws of
any applicable state of the United States in reliance upon specific exemptions
therefrom which depend upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the
investment intent as expressed herein and in any other representations,
warranties or information provided by the Shareholder under this Agreement. 

 

 Section 2.08

 

 _  Restrictions on Transfer_. The Shareholder acknowledges that the Shares
to be issued to the Shareholder must be held indefinitely unless subsequently
registered and qualified under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from
registration and qualification is otherwise available. In addition, the
Shareholder understands that the certificate representing the Shares will be
imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of such Shares unless
they are sold in a transaction in compliance with the Securities Act or are
registered and qualified or such registration and qualification are not
required in the opinion of counsel acceptable to the Parent. 

 

 Section 2.09

 

 _  Experience_. The Shareholder and/or the Shareholders personal
representative(s) have such knowledge and experience in financial, tax and
business matters to enable the Shareholder and/or them to utilize the
information made available to the Shareholder and/or them in connection with
the acquisition of the Shares to evaluate the merits and risks of the
prospective investment and to make an informed investment decision with
respect thereto. The Shareholder is experienced in evaluating and investing
companies such as the Parent.

 

 Section 2.10

 

 _  The Shareholders Liquidity_. In reaching the decision to acquire the
Shares, the Shareholder has carefully evaluated the Shareholders financial
resources and investment position and the risks associated with this
investment, and the Shareholder acknowledges that the Shareholder is able to
bear the economic risks of the investment. The Shareholder (i) has adequate
means of providing for the Shareholders current needs and possible personal
contingencies, (ii) has no need for liquidity in the Shareholders investment,
(iii) is able to bear the substantial economic risks of an investment in the
Shares for an indefinite period and (iv) at the present time, can afford a
complete loss of such investment. The Shareholders commitment to investments
which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Shareholders
net worth and the Shareholders investment in the Shares will not cause the
Shareholders overall commitment to become excessive.

   Section 2.11

 

 _  Offer and Sale_. The Shareholder understands that the offer and sale of
the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon
exemption therefrom. The Shareholder was not offered or sold the Shares,
directly or indirectly, by means of any form of general solicitation or
general advertisement, including the following: (i) any advertisement,
article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or
similar medium or broadcast over television or radio; or (ii) any seminar or
meeting whose attendees had been invited by general solicitation or general
advertising.

 

 Section 2.12

 

 _  Access to Data_. The Shareholder acknowledges that during the course of
this transaction and before deciding to acquire the Shares, the Shareholder
has been provided with financial and other written information about the
Parent. The Shareholder has been given the opportunity by the Parent to obtain
any information and ask questions concerning the Parent and the Shares that
the Shareholder felt necessary; and to the extent the Shareholder availed
itself of that opportunity, the Shareholder has received satisfactory
information and answers.

 

 Section 2.13

 

 _  Risks_. The Shareholder acknowledges and understands that (i) an
acquisition of Shares of the Parent constitutes a high risk, (ii) the Shares
are highly speculative, and (iii) there can be no assurance as to what
investment return, if any, there may be. The Shareholder is aware that the
Parent may issue additional securities in the future which could result in the
dilution of the Shareholders ownership interest in the Parent.

 

 Section 2.14

 

 _  Valid Agreement_. This Agreement when executed and delivered by the
Shareholder will constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the
Shareholder which is enforceable in accordance with its terms.

 

 Section 2.15

 

 _  Residence_. The address set forth on _Annex A_ hereto is the
Shareholders current address and accurately sets forth the Shareholders
place of residence.

 

 Section 2.16

 

 _  Legends_. It is understood that the Parent Stock will bear the following
legend or one that it substantially similar to the following legend:

 

 THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH
A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH
SALE OR DISPOSITION MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY
THAT SUCH REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933.

 



   Article III.

governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such

expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company, a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or on the ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions (a "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). The Company and each Company Subsidiary
is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or its ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification
necessary except where the failure to so qualify would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
to the Parent true and complete copies of the memorandum and articles of
association of the Company and such other constituent instruments of the
Company as may exist, each as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so

 Section 3.05

 

 _  No Conflicts; Consents_. 

 

 (a)

 

 The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to

Company Material Adverse Effect.

required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and
accurate, except to the extent any failure to file or any inaccuracies in any
filed Tax Returns, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
Taxes (as defined below) shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise
owed, have been timely paid, except to the extent that any failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no unpaid taxes

thereof through the date of such financial statements. No deficiency with
respect to any Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any such Taxes are pending, except to the extent any such deficiency or
request for waiver, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would

Company, any subsidiary or any of their respective properties before or by any
court, arbitrator, governmental or administrative agency, regulatory authority
(federal, state, county, local or foreign), stock market, stock exchange or
trading facility (" _Action_ ") which (i) adversely affects or challenges the
legality, validity or enforceability of any of this Agreement or the Shares or
(ii) could, if there were an unfavorable decision, individually or in the

Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws, including those
relating to occupational health and safety and the environment, except for
instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not

Effect. The Company has not received any written communication during the
past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company is not
in compliance in any material respect with any applicable Law. This Section
3.09 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject
of Section 3.06.

 

 Section 3.10

 

 _  Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses_. Except for fees due to HFG
International, Limited or its assigns, no broker, investment banker, financial

 Section 3.11

 

 _  Contracts_. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, there
are no Contracts that are material to the business, properties, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under (nor does there
exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is
a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   Section 3.12

 

 _  Title to Properties_. Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not own any real property. Each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has sufficient title to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the conduct
of its businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets and
properties in which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has
leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens that,
in the aggregate, do not and will not materially interfere with the ability of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct business as currently
conducted.

 

 Section 3.13

 

 _  Intellectual Property_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own, or
are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all patents, patent
rights, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, service
marks, service mark rights, copyrights and other proprietary intellectual
property rights and computer programs (collectively, " _Intellectual Property
Rights_ ") which are material to the conduct of the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a description of all Intellectual Property Rights which are
material to the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There are no claims pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any
person with regard to any Intellectual Property Right. To the knowledge of
the Company, no person is infringing the rights of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property Right.

 

 Section 3.14

 

 _  Labor Matters_. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union
agreements to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
or by which any of them is bound. No material labor dispute exists or, to the
knowledge of the Company, is imminent with respect to any of the employees of
the Company.

 

 Section 3.15

 

 _  Financial Statements_. The Company has delivered to the Parent its
audited consolidated financial statements for the period from inception of the
Company on September 10, 2007 through October 31, 2007 (collectively, the "
_Company Financial Statements_ "). The Company Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated. The Company Financial
Statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and
operating results of the Company, as of the dates, and for the periods,
indicated therein. The Company does not have any material liabilities or
obligations, contingent or otherwise, other than (i) liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business subsequent to October 31, 2007, and (ii)
obligations under contracts and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of
business and not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be
reflected in the Company Financial Statements, which, in both cases,
individually and in the aggregate would not be reasonably expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   Section 3.16

 

 _  Insurance_. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company and its subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial
responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are
prudent and customary in the businesses in which the Company and its
subsidiaries are engaged and in the geographic areas where they engage in such
businesses. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its and its
subsidiaries existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or
to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to
continue its business on terms consistent with market for the Companys and
such subsidiaries respective lines of business.

 

 Section 3.17

 

 _  Transactions With Affiliates and Employees_. Except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter and Company Financial Statements, none of the
officers or directors of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company,
none of the employees of the Company is presently a party to any transaction
with the Company or any subsidiary (other than for services as employees,
officers and directors), including any contract, agreement or other
arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for
rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring
payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any entity in which any officer, director, or any
such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee
or partner.

 

 Section 3.18

 

 _  Internal Accounting Controls_. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain
a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s
general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The Company has
established disclosure controls and procedures for the Company and designed
such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its subsidiaries, is made known to the
officers by others within those entities. The Companys officers have
evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys controls and procedures. Since
September 10, 2007, there have been no significant changes in the Companys
internal controls or, to the Companys knowledge, in other factors that could
significantly affect the Companys internal controls.

 

 Section 3.19

 

 _  Application of Takeover Protections_. The Company has taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share
acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution
under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the
Companys charter documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of formation that
is or could become applicable to the Shareholders as a result of the
Shareholders and the Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their

 Article IV.

 

  
  
   _Representations and Warranties of the Parent_

 

 The Parent represents and warrants as follows to each Shareholder and the
Company that, except as set forth in the reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents filed by the Parent with the SEC and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Parent SEC Documents_ ") or in the
letter delivered by the Parent to the Company and the Shareholders
concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "):

   Section 4.01

 

 _  Organization, Standing and Power_. The Parent is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada and has
full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own,
lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Parent, a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement or on
the ability of the Parent to consummate the Transactions (a " _Parent Material
Adverse Effect_ "). The Parent is duly qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or their ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary and where the failure to so
qualify would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
The Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the
certificate or articles of incorporation of the Parent, as amended to the date
of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Parent Charter_ "), and the Bylaws of
the Parent, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "
_Parent Bylaws_ "). 

 

 Section 4.02

 

 _  Subsidiaries; Equity Interests_. The Parent does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity interest in any person.

 

 Section 4.03

 

 _  Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Parent consists
of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Parent
Common Stock_ "), and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001
per share. As of the date hereof (i) 12,800,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
are issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of preferred stock are outstanding
and (iii) no shares of Parent Common Stock or preferred stock are held by the
Parent in its treasury. Except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of the Parent were issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Parent are,
and all such shares that may be issued prior to the date hereof will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right
under any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, the
Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws or any Contract to which the Parent is a
party or otherwise bound. There are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Parent having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
holders of Parent Common Stock may vote (" _Voting Parent Debt_ "). Except as
set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement, there are not any options,
warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock
rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments,
Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Parent is a
party or by which it is bound (i) obligating the Parent to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other equity interests in, or any security convertible or exercisable
for or exchangeable into any capital stock of or other equity interest in, the
Parent or any Voting Parent Debt, (ii) obligating the Parent to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, security,
commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii) that give any person
the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or derived from
the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of the capital stock of
the Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding
contractual obligations of the Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock of the Parent. Except as set forth in
the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Parent is not a party to any agreement
granting any securityholder of the Parent the right to cause the Parent to
register shares of the capital stock or other securities of the Parent held by
such securityholder under the Securities Act. The stockholder list provided
to the Company is a current stockholder list generated by its stock transfer
agent, and such list accurately reflects all of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Parents Common Stock.

   Section 4.04

 

 _  Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. The execution and
delivery by the Parent of this Agreement and the consummation by the Parent of
the Transactions have been duly authorized and approved by the Board of
Directors of the Parent and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Transactions. This
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Parent,
enforceable against the Parent in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

 Section 4.05

 

 _  No Conflicts; Consents_. 

 

 (a)

 

 Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, the execution and
delivery by the Parent of this Agreement, does not, and the consummation of
Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Parent under, any provision
of (i) the Parent Charter or Parent Bylaws, (ii) any material Contract to
which the Parent is a party or by which any of its properties or assets is
bound or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section
4.05(b), any material Judgment or material Law applicable to the Parent or its
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above,
any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (b)

 

 No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from,
any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to the Parent in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than filings
under state "blue sky" laws, as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

 Section 4.06

 

 _  SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 

 

 (a)

 

 The Parent has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents required to be filed by the Parent with the SEC since December 31,
2005, pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ," and such documents, the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ ").

 

 (b)

 

 As of its respective filing date, each Parent SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in
any Parent SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later Parent SEC
Document, none of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of the Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents comply
as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Parent
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

   (c)

 

 Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents, the Parent has no
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a balance sheet
of the Parent or in the notes thereto. The Parent Disclosure Letter sets
forth all financial and contractual obligations and liabilities (including any
obligations to issue capital stock or other securities of the parent) due
after the date hereof. All liabilities of the Parent shall have been paid off
and shall in no event remain liabilities of the Parent, the Company or the
Shareholders following the Closing.

 

 Section 4.07

 

 _  Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Documents or in the Parent Disclosure Letter, from the date of the most
recent audited financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents to
the date of this Agreement, the Parent has conducted its business only in the
ordinary course, and during such period there has not been:

 

 (a)

 

 any change in the assets, liabilities, financial condition or operating
results of the Parent from that reflected in the Parent SEC Documents, except
changes in the ordinary course of business that have not caused, in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 

 (b)

 

 any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that
would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 

 (c)

 

 any waiver or compromise by the Parent of a valuable right or of a material
debt owed to it;

 

 (d)

 

 any satisfaction or discharge of any lien, claim, or encumbrance or payment
of any obligation by the Parent, except in the ordinary course of business and
the satisfaction or discharge of which would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect;

 

 (e)

 

 any material change to a material Contract by which the Parent or any of its
assets is bound or subject;

 any material change in any compensation arrangement or agreement with any

ownership or use of such property or assets;

 

 (i)

 

 any loans or guarantees made by the Parent to or for the benefit of its
employees, officers or directors, or any members of their immediate families,
other than travel advances and other advances made in the ordinary course of

 any declaration, setting aside or payment or other distribution in respect
of any of the Parents capital stock, or any direct or indirect redemption,
purchase, or other acquisition of any of such stock by the Parent; 

 

 (k)

 

 any alteration of the Parents method of accounting or the identity of its
auditors; 

 

 (l)

 

 any issuance of equity securities to any officer, director or affiliate,

 (m)

 

 any arrangement or commitment by the Parent to do any of the things
described in this Section 4.07.

 

 Section 4.08

 

 _  Taxes_. 

 

 (a)

 

 The Parent has timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf,
all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,
complete and accurate, except to the extent any failure to file or any
inaccuracies in any filed Tax Returns, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. All Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise owed, has
been timely paid, except to the extent that any failure to pay, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (b)

 

 The most recent financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Documents
reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the Parent (in addition
to any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences between book
and Tax items) for all Taxable periods and portions thereof through the date
of such financial statements. No deficiency with respect to any Taxes has
been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Parent, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending, except to the extent
any such deficiency or request for waiver, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

   (c)

 

 There are no Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and
payable) on the assets of the Parent. The Parent is not bound by any
agreement with respect to Taxes.

 

 Section 4.09

 

 _  Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans_. From the date of the most recent
audited financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents to the date
of this Agreement, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any
material respect by the Parent of any collective bargaining agreement or any
bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement,
vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or
other plan, arrangement or understanding (whether or not legally binding)
providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of
the Parent (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "). As of the date of this

since its inception never has, maintained, or contributed to any "employee

Parent Benefit Plan for the benefit of any current or former employees,
consultants, officers or directors of the Parent. 

 

 Section 4.11

 

 _  Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, there is
no Action which (i) adversely affects or challenges the legality, validity or
enforceability of any of this Agreement or the Shares or (ii) could, if there
were an unfavorable decision, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Parent nor any subsidiary, nor any director or officer thereof (in his or
her capacity as such), is or has been the subject of any Action involving a
claim or violation of or liability under federal or state securities laws or a
claim of breach of fiduciary duty.

 

 Section 4.12

 

 _  Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents, the Parent is in compliance with all applicable Laws, including
those relating to occupational health and safety, the environment, export
controls, trade sanctions and embargos, except for instances of noncompliance
that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
the Parent SEC Documents, the Parent has not received any written
communication during the past two years from a Governmental Entity that
alleges that the Parent is not in compliance in any material respect with any
applicable Law. The Parent is in compliance with all effective requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, that are applicable to it, except where such noncompliance could
not have or reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. This Section 4.12 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes,
which are the subject of Section 4.08.

 

 Section 4.13

 

 _  Contracts_. Except as disclosed in the Parent Filed SEC Documents, there
are no Contracts that are material to the business, properties, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of the
Parent taken as a whole. The Parent is not in violation of or in default
under (nor does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or
the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any
Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

   Section 4.14

 

 _  Title to Properties_. The Parent has good title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the conduct of its
businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets and properties
in which the Parent has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens that, in the aggregate, do not and will not materially
interfere with the ability of the Parent to conduct business as currently
conducted. The Parent has complied in all material respects with the terms of
all material leases to which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy,
and all such leases are in full force and effect. The Parent enjoys peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all such material leases.

 

 Section 4.15

 

 _  Intellectual Property_. The Parent owns, or is validly licensed or
otherwise has the right to use, all Intellectual Property Rights which are
material to the conduct of the business of the Parent taken as a whole. The
Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a description of all Intellectual Property
Rights which are material to the conduct of the business of the Parent taken
as a whole. No claims are pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent,
threatened that the Parent is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the
rights of any person with regard to any Intellectual Property Right. To the
knowledge of the Parent, no person is infringing the rights of the Parent with
respect to any Intellectual Property Right.

 

 Section 4.16

 

 _  Labor Matters_. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union
agreements to which the Parent is a party or by which it is bound. No
material labor dispute exists or, to the knowledge of the Parent, is imminent
with respect to any of the employees of the Parent.

 

 Section 4.17

 

 _  Market Makers_. The Parent has at least two market makers for its common
shares and such market makers have obtained all permits and made all filings
necessary in order for such market makers to continue as market makers of the
Parent. 

 

 Section 4.18

 

 _  Transactions With Affiliates and Employees_. Except as set forth in the
Parent SEC Documents, none of the officers or directors of the Parent and, to
the knowledge of the Parent, none of the employees of the Parent is presently
a party to any transaction with the Parent or any subsidiary (other than for
services as employees, officers and directors), including any contract,
agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or
by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise
requiring payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to
the knowledge of the Parent, any entity in which any officer, director, or any
such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee
or partner.

 

 Section 4.19

 

 _  Internal Accounting Controls_. The Parent maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. The Parent has established disclosure
controls and procedures for the Parent and designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Parent is
made known to the officers by others within those entities. The Parents
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Parent\'s controls and
procedures. Since December 31, 2006, there have been no significant changes
in the Parents internal controls or, to the Parents knowledge, in other
factors that could significantly affect the Parents internal controls.

   Section 4.20

 

 _  Solvency_. Based on the financial condition of the Parent as of the
Closing Date (and assuming that the closing shall have occurred), (i) the
Parent\'s fair saleable value of its assets exceeds the amount that will be
required to be paid on or in respect of the Parent\'s existing debts and other
liabilities (including known contingent liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the
Parents assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its
business for the current fiscal year as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted including its capital needs taking into account the particular
capital requirements of the business conducted by the Parent, and projected
capital requirements and capital availability thereof, and (iii) the current
cash flow of the Parent, together with the proceeds the Parent would receive,
were it to liquidate all of its assets, after taking into account all
anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in
respect of its debt when such amounts are required to be paid. The Parent
does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or
in respect of its debt).

 

 Section 4.21

 

 _  Application of Takeover Protections_. The Parent has taken all necessary
action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition,
business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights
agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Parents charter
documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become
applicable to the Shareholders as a result of the Shareholders and the Parent
fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the issuance of the Shares and the
Shareholders ownership of the Shares.

 

 Section 4.22

 

 _  No Additional Agreements_. The Parent does not have any agreement or
understanding with the Shareholders with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than as specified in this Agreement.

 

 Section 4.23

immediately following the Closing will not have become, an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

 

 Section 4.24

 

 _  Disclosure_. The Parent confirms that neither it nor any person acting
on its behalf has provided any Shareholder or its respective agents or counsel
with any information that the Parent believes constitutes material, non-public
information except insofar as the existence and terms of the proposed
transactions hereunder may constitute such information and except for
information that will be disclosed by the Parent under a current report on
Form 8-K filed within four business days after the Closing. The Parent
understands and confirms that the Shareholders will rely on the foregoing
representations and covenants in effecting transactions in securities of the
Parent. All disclosure provided to the Shareholders regarding the Parent, its
business and the transactions contemplated hereby, furnished by or on behalf
of the Parent (including the Parents representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement) are true and correct and do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

   Section 4.25

 

 _  Certain Registration Matters_. Except as specified in the Parent
Disclosure Letter and except for registration rights granted to Halter
Financial Investments, L.P., the Parent has not granted or agreed to grant to
any person any rights (including "piggy-back" registration rights) to have any
securities of the Parent registered with the SEC or any other governmental
authority that have not been satisfied.

 

 Section 4.26

 

 _  Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. The Parent is, and has no reason
to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in
compliance with the listing and maintenance requirements for continued listing
of the Parent Stock on the trading market on which the Parent Stock are
currently listed or quoted. The issuance and sale of the Shares under this
Agreement does not contravene the rules and regulations of the trading market
on which the Parent Stock are currently listed or quoted, and no approval of
the stockholders of the Parent is required for the Parent to issue and deliver
to the Shareholders the Shares contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 Section 4.27

 

 _  No Undisclosed Events, Liabilities, Developments or Circumstances_. No
event, liability, development or circumstance has occurred or exists, or is
contemplated to occur with respect to the Parent, its subsidiaries or their
respective business, properties, prospects, operations or financial condition,
that would be required to be disclosed by the Parent under applicable
securities laws on a registration statement filed with the SEC relating to an
issuance and sale by the Parent of its Common Stock and which has not been
publicly announced.

 

 Section 4.28

 

 _  Foreign Corrupt Practices_. Neither the Parent, nor any of its
subsidiaries, nor, to the Parents knowledge, any director, officer, agent,
employee or other person acting on behalf of the Parent or any of its
subsidiaries has, in the course of its actions for, or on behalf of, the
Parent (i) used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity; (ii)
made any direct or indirect unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic
government official or employee from corporate funds; (iii) violated or is in
violation of any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,
as amended; or (iv) made any unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff, influence
payment, kickback or other unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic
government official or employee.

Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed by
the Company, the Parent and the Shareholders holding a majority of the Shares.
No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or
requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the

of any such right. No consideration shall be offered or paid to any
Shareholder to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision
of any transaction document unless the same consideration is also offered to
all Shareholders who then hold Shares.

 

 Section 8.03

 

 _  Replacement of Securities_. If any certificate or instrument evidencing
any Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Parent shall issue or
cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation

remedy at law would be adequate.

 

 Section 8.05

 

 _  Independent Nature of Shareholders\' Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Shareholder under this Agreement are several and not joint
with the obligations of any other Shareholder, and no Shareholder shall be
responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other
Shareholder under this Agreement. The decision of each Shareholder to acquire
Shares pursuant to this Agreement has been made by such Shareholder
independently of any other Shareholder. Nothing contained herein, and no
action taken by any Shareholder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute
the Shareholders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Shareholders are in any
way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated herein. Each Shareholder shall be entitled to
independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation the
rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any
other Shareholder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for
such purpose. Each of the Company and the Parent acknowledge that each of the

closing a transaction with multiple Shareholders and not because it was
required or requested to do so by any Shareholder.

 

 Section 8.06

 

 _  Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
liability of a Shareholder arising directly or indirectly, under any
transaction document of any and every nature whatsoever shall be satisfied
solely out of the assets of such Shareholder, and that no trustee, officer,
other investment vehicle or any other affiliate of such Shareholder or any
investor, shareholder or holder of shares of beneficial interest of such
Shareholder shall be personally liable for any liabilities of such
Shareholder.

 

 Section 8.07

 

 _  Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". 

 

 Section 8.08

 

 _  Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that Transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

   

 Section 8.09

 

 _  Counterparts; Facsimile Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Facsimile
execution and delivery of this Agreement is legal, valid and binding for all
purposes.

 

 Section 8.10

 

 _  Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, taken
together with the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter,
(a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
Transactions and (b) are not intended to confer upon any person other than the
Parties any rights or remedies.

 

 Section 8.11

 

 _  Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof, except to the extent the laws of Nevada are mandatorily applicable to
the Transactions.

 

 Section 8.12

 

 _  Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without such consent
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.
