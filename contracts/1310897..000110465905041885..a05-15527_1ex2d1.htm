WHEREAS, the respective Board of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved, and deem it advisable to consummate, the merger of

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and,
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I**

  

# 

  

# **The Merger**

  

# 

  

## 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the " _
_Merger__ ") with and into the Company in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the " _ _DGCL__
"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _ _Surviving
Corporation__ ").

  

## 

  

## 1.2. _Closing Date_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date (the " _ _Closing Date__ "), which
shall be the date after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article V other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment
or waiver of those conditions, that is the earlier of (a) a date during
the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent on no less than three Business

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

## Days notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period,

writing by the parties hereto.

  

## 

  

## 1.3. _Effective Time_. Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will
file a certificate of merger (the " _ _Certificate of Merger__ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed by Parent
and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _
_Effective Time__ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

## 

  

## 1.4. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
amended to read in its entirety in the same fashion as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, other than the incorporator of Merger Sub, the
exculpation and indemnification provisions (which shall remain unchanged),
and corporate name (which shall remain PanAmSat Holding Corporation), and, as
so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving

### automatically be converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share

(the " _ _Merger Consideration__ "), payable to the holder of such shares of
Company Common Stock, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.8,

Company.  Promptly and in any event no later than simultaneously with the
Closing, the Company shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the proceeds of
the PanAmSat Debt Financing (including the cash on hand contemplated thereby,
less the amount of any fees or expenses paid by the Company) with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common

Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 1.7(c), the Dissenting Shares and the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, or the Company or any of
their respective wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries) and (ii) the

_Certificates__ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 1.7(a) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration:  (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions not inconsistent with
this Agreement as

### Parent and Surviving Corporation shall reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate
is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(a) (without limiting the effect of
Section 1.11).  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor
the aggregate Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.7(a) (after taking into account all Certificates
surrendered by such holder), and each Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.  Until so surrendered, each Certificate will
represent, from and after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Article I.  No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the amounts payable pursuant to this Article I
upon surrender of a Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Agent_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall, at the request of Parent, be delivered to
Parent (or an affiliate of Parent) or otherwise on the instruction of Parent,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered
such Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.8 shall after such
delivery look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) for payment, as general creditors thereof, of their claim for
the Merger Consideration, without interest, to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(a). Any such portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

## 1.9. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration in
the Merger shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
law. The Merger Consideration paid in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. As of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
those stockholders whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of such shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates with respect to those stockholders whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration in the Merger are

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

## presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided for in
this Article I.

  

## 

  

## 1.10. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
Article I; provided, however, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, as a
condition precedent to such delivery, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as they may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

## 

  

## 1.11. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
held by a Person who has the right to and has demanded appraisal of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _ _Dissenting
Holder__ "), and as of the Effective Time has not failed to perfect,
effectively withdrawn or lost his right to such appraisal (" _
_Dissenting Shares__ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7(a), but
such Dissenting Holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights in
respect thereof as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

## 

  

## 1.12. _Withdrawal_. Notwithstanding the provision of Section 1.11, if any
Dissenting Holder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) his right to appraisal, then as of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later, such shares
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 1.7(a), without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares in accordance with Section 1.7(a).

  

## 

  

## 1.13. _Notice of Dissenters_. The Company shall provide Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal or payment of the fair
value of any shares of Company Common Stock, the withdrawals of such demands
and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent and, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal and shall not settle or offer to settle any such demands.

  

## 

  

## 1.14. _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger such amounts as the
Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or
under any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

## the holder of the Company Common Stock, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent.

  

## 

  

## 1.15. _Transfer of Ownership_. If the Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered,
it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Persons requesting such payment will have paid to the Surviving Corporation
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the amount specified in Section 1.7(a) to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or any agent
designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

## 

  

## 1.16. _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Effective Time, and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall, subject
to this Article I, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with

not solicited in violation of this Section 4.6 that is on terms that the
Companys Board of Directors (or any authorized committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with its counsel and financial advisors,

faith deems relevant, including the identity of the offeror and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the terms

other agreements with or to one or more Governmental Authorities (each, a " _
_Settlement__ ") in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including obtaining the requisite consent of such Governmental
Authorities), including one or more Settlements that require Parent or, to
the extent requested by Parent, the Company, to restructure the operations
of, and sell or otherwise divest or dispose of its or its Subsidiaries
assets up to the Limit; provided, however, that (A) the Company shall not
take any of the foregoing actions without the consent of Parent, and (B)
Parent shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the consent of the
Company if such actions would bind the Company to do something irrespective
of whether the Closing occurs. In addition, Parent and the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries shall, subject to the preceding and next
succeeding sentences, use their respective reasonable best efforts to seek to
lift, reverse or remove any temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order or decree that would otherwise give rise
to a failure of any Regulatory Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be obligated to agree, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall or shall agree without Parents
consent, to take any action or to accept any condition,
restriction, obligation or requirement with respect to Parent, the Company,
their respective Subsidiaries or their and their Subsidiaries assets if such
action, condition, restriction, obligation or requirement would be, or result
in, individually or in the aggregate, a Burdensome Condition.

  

### 

  

### (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Section 4.8 shall (i) limit either the Companys or Parents right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6 hereof so long as such party
has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
4.8, or (ii) require any party to amend this Agreement or to waive or forbear
from exercising any of its rights or remedies hereunder or under this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 4.9. _Approach to Proceedings_. Parent will determine strategy, lead all
proceedings and coordinate all activities with respect to seeking any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any Governmental Authority as
contemplated hereby, and the Company and its Subsidiaries will take such
actions as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining such
consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding Parents rights to lead
all proceedings as provided in the prior sentence, Parent shall not require
the Company to, and the Company shall not be required to, take any action
with respect to satisfying the Regulatory Conditions which would bind the
Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Closing occurs.
For all purposes and provisions of this Agreement, each requirement for the
Company and its Subsidiaries to use "reasonable best efforts" in respect of
matters relating to the satisfaction of the Regulatory Conditions is subject
to the following qualifications: (1) except as requested or directed by
Parent, the Company shall not be obligated to offer or agree to

which Parent has made a specific request or provided specific direction to
the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy
their reasonable best efforts obligation if it or they use reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the actions so requested or directed.  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub may withdraw or
cause the withdrawal, or request the Company to withdraw, any filing, notice
or consent without being deemed to be in breach of any obligation hereunder
so long as action was taken in good faith with the goal of enabling the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the Outside
Date.

  

## 

  

## 4.10. _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in
effect, Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing
any press release or making any SEC filing or other public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except

Exchange (in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such press release
or making any such SEC filing or public statement), will not issue any such
press release or make any such SEC filing or other public statement prior to
such consultation and providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity
to comment thereon.

## 

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, the bylaws and certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, present and

modified for a period of six years from the Closing Date in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the individuals who at the

such modification is required after the Closing by applicable Law.  Parent
shall obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from the Closing with respect to the directors
and officers liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable
as the coverage applicable to the Companys directors and officers for the
period from August 20, 2004 through the Closing Date; _provided_ , if the
premiums for such tail insurance policies exceed 200% of the per annum rate
of premium paid by the Company as of the date hereof for such insurance, then
Parent shall provide a policy with the best coverage as shall then be
available at 200% of such rate (which annual premium is set forth on Section
4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule);

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent agrees that for six years after the Closing Date, it shall,
and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify each Person

successors and assigns (individually an " _ _Indemnified Party__ " and
collectively the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), with respect to any claim,
liability, loss, damage, judgment, fine, penalty, amount paid in settlement
or compromise, cost or expense (including reasonable fees and expenses of
legal counsel), against any Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a
officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whenever asserted or

other Law and including any liability arising out of or pertaining to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the same extent
as provided in the Companys bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation
or any other applicable contract or agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement. In the event of any claim, liability, loss, damage, judgment,
fine, penalty, amount paid in settlement or compromise, cost or expense
described in the preceding sentence, the Company shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties
promptly after statements are received in advance of settlement, judgment or
other resolution thereof to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement
of documented expenses reasonably incurred, provided the applicable
Indemnified Parties provide an undertaking to repay all advanced expenses if
it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Parties are not
entitled to indemnification.

  

### 

  

### (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall

of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under applicable Law or under any agreement of
any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

## 4.12. _Employee Benefits_. (a) For the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the Continuation Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company and its other Subsidiaries to, maintain (i) employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements, salaries and bonus programs (excluding equity-

Incentive Plan which will continue in accordance with its terms through the
calendar quarter in which the Closing Date occurs) and any provision
under the PanAmSat Corporation Retirement Savings Plan increasing the
company matching contribution in effect since the Company Balance Sheet Date)
for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date who continue to be so employed after the Closing
Date, which are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided
pursuant to Company Plans (excluding equity-based plans, retention and bonus
programs (except for the Companys Sales Incentive Plan which will continue
in accordance with its terms through the calendar quarter in which the
Closing Date occurs) and any provision under the PanAmSat Corporation
Retirement Savings Plan increasing the company matching contribution in
effect since the Company Balance Sheet Date) as of immediately before the
Closing Date, (ii) employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements,
salaries and bonus programs that are triggered upon the termination of
employment for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

## of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date who continue to be so
employed after the Closing Date, which are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than those provided pursuant to the Company Maintained Plans as of
immediately before the Closing Date and (iii) contribution levels and loan
provisions under the defined contribution plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case, at levels which are no less favorable than those
provided as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 4.12 to the contrary, for the three-year period beginning on
the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and its other
Subsidiaries to, honor the terms of the Companys 2005 Severance Pay Plan as
it exists on the date hereof, subject to the amendment of the Severance Plan
described in Section 2.15(g) hereof (the " _ _Severance Plan__ "). Employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date who
continue to be so employed after the Closing Date (a " _ _Covered Company
Employee__ ") shall be given credit for all service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (and service credited by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing Date (to the extent recognized as service
under corresponding Company Plans in effect immediately before the Closing
Date) for crediting service for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and determination of level of benefits (other than for level of
benefits under any defined benefit pension plan, except as would result in
the duplication of benefits or under plans or programs which do not provide
for credit for prior service for employees of Parent generally), under (i)
all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or
contributed to by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, the Company) in which such Covered Company Employees become
participants, and (ii) severance plans for purposes of calculating the amount
of each Covered Company Employees severance benefits. After the Closing
Date, Parent and the Company shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Covered Company Employees under any
welfare benefit plans that such Covered Company Employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date, to the extent such waivers are
consistent with the welfare benefit plans in which the Covered Company
Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
provide each Covered Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid during the portion of the relevant plan year prior to the
Closing Date in which the Closing Date occurs in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
Covered Company Employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing
Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Company to honor (1) those employment,
termination and severance agreements, in each case, to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (2) those incentive compensation plans
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all as set forth in
Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject in each case to the
terms of such agreements and plans, including such terms governing amendment
and termination thereof.  Except as expressly provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, this Section 4.12 shall not require Parent to continue or
cause the Company to continue any specific Company Plan or continue the
employment of employees. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Person (other than the parties hereto) shall have any rights or remedies
pursuant to this Section 4.12.

  

## 

  

### (b) For the calendar year in which the Closing occurs (the " _
_Closing Year__ ") the Company shall pay an annual bonus (the " _ _Closing
Year Bonus__ "), based upon the sum of the Pre-Closing Amount plus the Post-
Closing Amount, to employees who remain employed with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries through the date on which bonuses are generally paid by

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

### Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(pro rata for any employee hired by the Company after January 1 of the
Closing Year). The Closing Year Bonus shall be comprised of (x) an amount
prorated through the Closing Date based upon performance through the Closing
Date (the " _ _Pre-Closing Date Amount__ ") and (y) an amount based upon
performance from the Closing Date through December 31 of the Closing Year
(the " _ _Post Closing Date Amount__ "), and shall be earned separately for
each such period based upon achievement of applicable performance goals
during such period. In determining the amount of the bonuses to be earned for
the Pre-Closing Date Amount, the Company shall set annual bonus targets for
officers and employees with respect to any calendar year prior to the Closing
Year in amounts and on terms and conditions and other criteria in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and such
targets shall be substantially comparable to and no more likely to be
achieved at the time they are established than the corresponding performance
targets established for the Companys 2005 Annual Incentive Plan, and the
Company shall provide for no greater target or maximum bonus (expressed as a
percentage of base salary) for each participant in the Annual Incentive Plan
than was provided for in 2005 (other than in connection with promotions or
newly hired employees, provided that such target or maximum bonus amounts
shall be established in a manner consistent with similarly situated
employees). All annual bonuses paid pursuant to this Section 4.12(b) shall be
paid as of the date on which Purchaser and its Subsidiaries pay
annual bonuses to employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries generally;
provided that with respect to any employee who is (i) terminated by Parent or
the Company without Cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) or (ii)
terminates employment for Good Reason (as defined in Appendix A to the
Severance Plan), in either case, on or after the Closing Date, any such
employee shall be paid, on or reasonably promptly after the date of such
termination, the Pre-Closing Date Amount. Parent shall set annual
bonus targets for Covered Company Employees with respect to 2006 and/or 2007,
as applicable, under an annual bonus plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries (the
" _ _Parent Bonus Plan__ ") in amounts and on terms and conditions and other
criteria in the ordinary course of business consistent with the past practice
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (taking into account the effect of this
transaction) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and no less likely to be achieved than bonuses established for
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries and, at the cost of Parent, to provide any necessary "comfort
letters" and to prepare and deliver other customary opinions and other
deliverables.

of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries) and financial statements
relating to completed or probable acquisitions (including pro forma financial

Regulation S-X that would apply to a Form S-1 registration statement being
filed by the Company on such date of delivery under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _ _Required Financial Information__ "); _provided_  
_that_ , if on any date during such 30-day period prior to the Closing Date
financial statements for a later period-end would be required if the Company
filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on such date, and the
Administrative Agent requests that such financial statement be provided, then
financial statements with such later period-end meeting the forgoing
requirements shall have also been received reasonably promptly following such
request, and in any event, prior to the Closing Date.

## 7.3. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, each
Transaction Document (including the Company Disclosure Schedule and any
exhibits hereto), the other agreements referred to in this Agreement,
each other Transaction Document, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Voting Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements, understandings and negotiations, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect to such subject matter and (ii) are not
intended to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto or thereto)
any rights or remedies hereunder, except only as specifically provided,
following the Closing, the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 4.11.

  

## 

  

## 7.4. _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_.
The representations and warranties contained herein or in any schedule,
instrument or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the

terms contemplate a shorter survival time).

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

## 7.5. _Amendments; No Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Closing if, and only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the
Company and Parent or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that after the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by the Companys stockholders
without obtaining the further approval of such stockholders.  No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Law.

  

## 

  

## 7.6. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that
no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without such consent shall
be null and void without effect; and provided, further, that Parent and
Merger Sub may assign their respective rights or obligations hereunder to
Intelsat Holdings, Ltd. and/or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of Intelsat Holdings, Ltd. (or any successor thereto) without
the prior written consent of the parties hereto.

  

## 

  

## 7.7. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any controversies arising with
respect hereto shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of Delaware (without regard to principles of conflict of
laws that would apply the law of another jurisdiction).

  

## 

  

## 7.8. _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be brought against any of the parties in any Federal
court located in the State of Delaware, or any Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or outside the State of Delaware. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that service of
process upon such party at the address referred to in Section 7.2, together
with written notice of such service to such party, shall be deemed effective
service of process upon such party.

  

## 

  

## 7.9. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

determination that any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is invalid, void, unenforceable or against regulatory policy,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

## 

  

## 7.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that the remedies at
law for any breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are
inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived.
