on the second business day after the date on which each of the conditions set
forth in Article 9 has been satisfied or waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as MergerCo and the Company may mutually
agree. At the Closing, MergerCo and the Company shall cause a certificate of

executed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.  The
Merger shall become effective as of the date and time of such filing or such
other time after such filing as MergerCo and the Company shall agree in the
Certificate of Merger (the " **Effective Time** ").

  



  

Section 2.03 _. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers.
_(a) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company or MergerCo, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and thereafter

(b) The bylaws of the Company shall become, from and after the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended or
repealed as provided therein or in the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

(c) The directors of MergerCo and the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become, from and after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed or their earlier
resignation or removal.

  



  

Section 2.04. _Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time:

  



  

(i) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.04(ii), each Share shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount, calculated as set forth in
Schedule 2.04 and adjusted pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sections
2.11, 2.12 and 2.13 (such adjusted amount, the " **Share** **Consideration**
"), in cash without interest, except as contemplated by Section 4 of the
Escrow Agreement;

  



  

(ii) each Share held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and

  



  

(iii) each share of common stock of MergerCo outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation with the

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.05. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) At Closing, in addition to
making the payments set forth in Section 7.09, Buyer or MergerCo shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited (x) with the Company, in a separate
account established for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Company
Warrants (the " **Payment Fund** "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the estimate of the aggregate Share
Consideration furnished pursuant to Section 2.11 and the estimate of the
aggregate Warrant Consideration furnished pursuant to Section 2.11,  _less_
the Escrow Amount, and (y) with the Escrow Agent, in a separate account
established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement for the benefit of the holders
of Shares and Company Warrants (the " **Escrow Fund** "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Escrow Amount. Neither the Payment Fund nor
the Escrow Fund shall be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in
this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the applicable Share Consideration will be entitled to receive upon surrender
to the Surviving Corporation of certificates representing Shares (the "
**Share** **Certificates** "), together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, the Share Consideration for each Share represented by such Share
Certificate, in the manner and at the times set forth in Sections 2.05(c) and
2.13. Until so surrendered, each such Share Certificate shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Share
Consideration.

  



  

(c) Payment of the applicable Share Consideration shall be effected in the
following manner:

  



  

(i) If any holder of record of any Shares surrenders such holders
Share Certificate(s), together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, to the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, or
thereafter but prior to the determination of Final Working Capital, then such
holder shall receive (A) payment of the applicable Initial Payment for such
Shares, if surrendered at the Effective Time, at the Closing, or, if
surrendered after the Effective Time, on the second business day after such
surrender, and (B) the applicable Final Payment for such Shares in accordance
with Section 2.13, in each case in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account designated by such holder in the letter of
transmittal.

  



  

(ii) If any holder of record of any Shares surrenders such holders
Share Certificate(s), together with a properly completed letter of

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

transmittal, to the Surviving Corporation after the determination of Final
Working Capital, then such holder shall be entitled to receive payment of the
Share Consideration for each such Share on the second business day after such
surrender in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by such holder in the letter of transmittal.

  



  

No later than two business days prior to the date on which the Closing is
scheduled to occur, the Company shall send to each holder of Shares a
letter of transmittal for use in exchanging such Shares for the applicable
Share Consideration. The letter of transmittal shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

  



  

(d) If any portion of the applicable Share Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Share Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Share
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Share Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Share Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the applicable Share Consideration. For purposes of such exchange, the
canceled Shares shall be deemed surrendered pursuant to Section 2.05(c) as
of the date presented to the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(f) Any amount in the Payment Fund and the Escrow Fund (and any interest or
other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders and
the holders of the Company Warrants after the later of (i) the
determination of the Final Working Capital and Final Closing Cash and (ii) a
period of 12 months immediately following the Effective Time shall be
returned to the Surviving Corporation, and any holder who has not exchanged
its Shares for the applicable Share Consideration and any holder who has not
exercised its Company Warrants for the applicable Warrant Consideration prior
to such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment thereof without any interest thereon. Any portion of the aggregate
Share Consideration (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that
remains unclaimed by the Stockholders on the second anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs (or such earlier date immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any governmental authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the property of the

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the aggregate
Warrant Consideration that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company
Warrants at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 15, 2014 shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable law and the provisions of the Warrant
Agreement, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Sections 2.04 and 2.05,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with
Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to receive the
applicable Share Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal.  If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the applicable
Share Consideration, to be paid as provided in Section 2.05(c). The Company
shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.07 _. Warrants. _(a) At or after the Effective Time, upon the
exercise of any Company Warrant by any holder thereof and upon such holders
surrender of such holders certificates representing such Company Warrants
(the " **Warrant Certificates** ") to the Surviving Corporation, in each case
in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver to such holder the
applicable Warrant Consideration, in the manner and at the times set forth in
Sections 2.07(b) and 2.13.

  



  

(b) Payment of the applicable Warrant Consideration shall be effected in the
following manner:

  



  

(i) If any holder of any Company Warrants exercises such Company Warrants,
and surrenders such holders Warrant Certificate(s) therefor to the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time, or thereafter but prior to the
determination of the Final Working Capital, then such holder shall receive
(A) payment of the applicable Initial Payment for such Company Warrants, if
surrendered at the Effective Time, at the Closing, or, if surrendered after
the Effective Time, on the second business day after such surrender, and (B)
the applicable Final Payment for such

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

Company Warrants in accordance with Section 2.13, in each case in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by such holder in
writing at the time of surrendering such Warrant Certificate(s).

  



  

(ii) If any holder of Company Warrants exercises such Company Warrants, and
surrenders such holders Warrant Certificate(s) therefor to the Surviving
Corporation after the determination of the Final Working Capital, then such
holder shall be entitled to receive payment of the applicable Warrant
Consideration for such Company Warrants on the second business day after such
surrender in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by such holder in writing at the time of surrendering such Warrant
Certificate(s).

  



  

Section 2.08. _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the applicable Share Consideration and the applicable
Warrant Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

Section 2.09. _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving
Corporation so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or
Company Warrants in respect of which the Surviving Corporation made such
deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 2.10. _Lost Share Certificates_. If any Share Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and such indemnification or other undertakings as may be reasonably requested
by the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will pay, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate, the applicable Share
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Share
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

  



  

Section 2.11 _. Estimate of Share Consideration. _No later than five (5)
business days prior to the date on which the Closing is scheduled to occur,
the Company shall furnish to Buyer a statement, prepared in reasonable
detail,

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

reflecting the Companys good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital (the
" **Estimated Working Capital** ") and the Companys good faith estimate of
Closing Cash (the " **Estimated Closing Cash** "), in each case determined in
accordance with the definitions thereof. The Company shall also deliver to
Buyer its estimated calculation of the Share Consideration, the Warrant
Consideration and the Per Share Escrow Amount. Such calculations shall be
made by applying the Estimated Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Cash
and the amounts reflected on the pay-off letter from the Administrative Agent
under the Senior Credit Agreement delivered pursuant to Section 7.09 and the
amounts of Transaction Expenses to the methodology set forth in Schedule 2.04.
Buyer and the Company shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve
any dispute regarding the Estimate Closing Cash prior to Closing; _provided_
that if any such item of dispute is not resolved by agreement in writing
between Buyer and the Company not less than two (2) business days prior to
the Closing, then the Companys estimate of such disputed items, together
with the resolved items, shall be the final estimates.

  



  

Section 2.12. _Closing Working Capital_. (a) As promptly as practicable, but
no later than 60 days after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will cause
to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholders Representative (i) a
statement setting forth the Surviving Corporations calculation of Closing
Working Capital (the " **Closing Working Capital Statement** "), and (ii)
a statement setting forth the Surviving Corporations calculation of Closing
Cash (the " **Closing Cash Statement** " and together with the Closing
Working Capital Statement, the " **Closing Statements** "), in each case
determined in accordance with the definitions thereof. The
Closing Statements shall (i) be signed by the Surviving Corporations
chief financial officer, (ii) fairly present the Closing Working Capital
and Closing Cash, each in accordance with the definitions thereof, and (iii)
the Closing Working Capital Statement shall specifically identify the
respective amounts of inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and
other current assets (and, in each case, any allowances or reserves therefor)
and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities used for
the Surviving Corporations calculation of Closing Working Capital.

  



  

(b) If the Stockholders Representative disagrees with the Surviving
Corporations calculation of Closing Working Capital or Closing Cash
delivered pursuant to Section 2.12(a), the Stockholders Representative may,
within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statements, deliver a written
notice to the Surviving Corporation and Buyer disagreeing with such
calculation and setting forth the Stockholders Representatives calculation
of such amount.  Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or
amounts as to which the Stockholders Representative disagrees, and the
Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other
items and amounts contained in the relevant Closing Statement and the
Surviving Corporations calculation of Closing Working

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

Capital or Closing Cash, as the case may be, and such agreed items and
amounts shall be final and binding upon the parties. If the
Stockholders Representative fails to deliver such a written notice within
such 30 day period, the Surviving Corporations calculation of Closing
Working Capital and Closing Cash, respectively, shall be final and binding
upon the parties.

  



  

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.12(b), the Stockholders Representative, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall, during the 30 days following such delivery, use all
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital
or Closing Cash, as the case may be. Any written agreement by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative resolving
any disputed items or amounts during such period or any mutually agreed
extension thereof shall be final and binding upon the parties. If, during
such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Stockholders
Representative, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst and Young LLP or such
other nationally recognized accounting firm agreed to among the parties (the
" **Neutral Arbitrator** ") promptly to review this Section 2.12 and the
disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working
Capital or Closing Cash, as the case may be. In making such calculation,
the Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator and shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Surviving Corporations calculation of Closing
Working Capital or Closing Cash, as the case may be, as to which the
Stockholders Representative has disagreed. The Neutral Arbitrator shall
make its determination based solely on the presentations and supporting
materials provided by the parties and not pursuant to any independent review.
The Neutral Arbitrator shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative,
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as practicable, a written
report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and
binding upon the Stockholders Representative, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation, and judgment may be entered on the award. The fees and expenses
of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be allocated to and paid by the Buyer and
Stockholders Representative in the same proportion that the aggregate amount
of the disputed items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Neutral
Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so submitted;
_provided_ that such fees and expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator allocable to
and payable by the Stockholders Representative may be paid by the
Stockholders Representative from the Escrow Fund.

  



  

(d) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation agree that they will, and Buyer will
cause its Subsidiaries to, and Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to
cause its and the Surviving Corporations respective independent accountants
to, cooperate and assist the Stockholders Representative in the review of
the Closing

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

Statements, including without limitation, the making available of books,
records, work papers and personnel; _provided_ that any such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries. If any party fails to submit a statement
regarding any disputed item submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within the
time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator (which shall take into account the
proviso in the immediately preceding sentence) or otherwise fails to give the
Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested, then the Neutral
Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely
submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative.

  



  

Section 2.13 _. Adjustment of Share Consideration and Warrant Consideration.
 _(a) If the sum of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Closing Cash
exceeds the sum of Final Working Capital and Final Closing Cash (the amount
of such excess being referred to as the " **Shortfall Amount** "), then (i)
the Share Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Shortfall
Amount (not to exceed the Escrow Amount) divided by the Full Dilution Number
(the " **Common Stock Reduction** ") and (ii) the Warrant Consideration for
each Company Warrant shall be reduced by the product of the Common Stock
Reduction and the number of Voting Common Shares issuable upon exercise of
such Company Warrant. No Stockholder or holder of Company Warrants shall
have any liability to the Surviving Corporation or to Buyer for any amount by
which the Shortfall Amount may exceed the Escrow Amount.

  



  

(b) If the sum of Final Working Capital and Final Closing Cash exceeds the
sum of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Closing Cash (the amount of
such excess being referred to as the " **Excess Amount** "), then (i) the
Share Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the Excess
Amount divided by the Full Dilution Number (the " **Common Stock Increase** ")
and (ii) the Warrant Consideration shall be increased by the product of the
Common Stock Increase and the number of Voting Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of such Company Warrant.

  



  

(c) Promptly following determination of Final Working Capital and Final
Closing Cash, each holder of any Shares that has previously surrendered Share
Certificate(s) therefor pursuant to Section 2.05(c), and each holder of
Company Warrants that has previously exercised such Company Warrants and
surrendered the Warrant Certificate(s) pursuant to Section 2.07, shall be
entitled to prompt payment of the applicable Final Payment, if any, in
respect thereof from the Surviving Corporation. To the extent funds are
available in the Escrow Fund, the Surviving Corporation may cause payment of
the Final Payment to be made in accordance with Section 5 of the Escrow
Agreement. If there is no Excess Amount, or if the Excess Amount is less than
the amounts in the Escrow Fund, Buyer shall be entitled to receive the
amounts remaining in the Escrow

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

Fund after the payment of the applicable Final Payment. If for any reason
the Payment Fund and the Escrow Fund are inadequate to pay all amounts to
which the holders of Shares and Company Warrants shall be entitled, pursuant
to this Agreement, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and
severally liable for payment thereof. Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative each agrees to instruct the Escrow Agent to make disbursements
from the Escrow Fund consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.13.

  



  

ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation

necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

47

Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Sections 3.12 or 5.06.

  



  

Section 6.04 _. Stockholder Approval. _The Company shall, reasonably promptly
after the date hereof and in any case within 10 business days, distribute a
written consent of stockholders to be executed by the Companys stockholders,
or shall cause a stockholder meeting to be duly called and held as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date hereof, in either case for the
purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger (" **Stockholder Approval** "). In connection therewith, the
Company shall furnish such material to its stockholders, if any, as shall be
required by Delaware Law. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend, and use its best efforts to obtain, Stockholder Approval.

  



  

Section 6.05. _Stockholders  Representative_. DLJMB will serve as the
Stockholders representative (in such capacity, the " **Stockholders 
Representative**") and will take such actions to be taken by the

deem necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including (i) taking all actions and making all filings on behalf of

Closing Cash, (iii) subject to Section 11.03, negotiating and executing any
waivers or amendments of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and (iv)

act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders Representative while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment.

  



  

Section 6.06 _. Debt Offer and Consent Solicitation. _(a) As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause Mueller
Group to, prepare and commence an offer to purchase all of Mueller Groups
outstanding Second Priority Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the
" **Second Priority Notes** ") with the minimum tender conditions and such
other terms and conditions, in accordance with applicable law, as are
reasonably requested by Buyer (the " **Debt Offer** "), together with a letter
of transmittal and such other customary documents required in connection
therewith (collectively, together with the documents required for the Consent
Solicitation (as defined below), the " **Offer Documents** "). The Company
shall use, and shall cause Mueller Group to use, its reasonable best efforts
to consummate such Debt Offer as soon as practicable after the date hereof;
_provided_  that any payment for the Second Priority Notes and/or the
consents referred to in Section 6.06(b) shall only be made after the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
no change to the terms or conditions of the Debt Offer which decreases the
price per Second Priority Note payable in the Debt Offer, changes the form of
consideration payable in the Debt Offer (other than by adding consideration)
or imposes conditions to or changes any of the terms of the Debt Offer in any
manner that is adverse to holders of the Second Priority Notes or which would
be reasonably likely to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
Closing shall be made unless such change was previously approved by the
Company, and neither the Company nor Mueller Group shall be required to make
any such change. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that a request
by Buyer that the Company or Mueller Group waive any condition or other
provision in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole
discretion shall not be deemed to be adverse to any holder of the Second
Priority Notes.  Neither the Company nor Mueller Group shall be required to
waive any condition that would require any payment for the Second Priority
Notes and/or the consents referred to in Section 6.06(b) to be made at or
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) As part of the Debt Offer, the Company shall, and shall cause Mueller
Group to, solicit the consent (the " **Consent Solicitation** ") of the
holders of the Second Priority Notes to amendments to the Indenture (the "
**Indenture** "), dated as of April 23, 2004, among Mueller Group, the
Guarantors named therein

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

and the Trustee, relating to the Second Priority Notes, as set forth in
Schedule 6.06 (the " **Amendments** "). The Company shall, and shall cause
Mueller Group to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, the consent of holders representing at
least two-thirds of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Second Priority Notes (the " **Requisite Consent** ") to authorize
the Amendments. Promptly upon receipt of the Requisite Consent, the Company
shall, shall cause Mueller Group to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Trustee to, execute a supplemental indenture
incorporating and giving effect to the Amendments; _provided_ that the
Amendments shall not become effective until the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) The Company shall not, and shall cause Mueller Group not to, make any
change to any term or condition, or waive any condition or other provision,
of the Debt Offer or Consent Solicitation, without Buyers prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  The
Company shall, and shall cause Mueller Group to, waive any condition or other
provision of the Debt Offer or Consent Solicitation reasonably requested by
Buyer, except that neither the Company nor Mueller Group shall be required to
waive any condition that would require any payment for the Second Priority
Notes and/or the consents referred to in Section 6.06(b) to be made at or
prior to the Effective Time.  The Company shall give Buyer an opportunity to
review and comment on drafts of the Offer Documents and any other mailing to
the holders of Second Priority Notes in connection with the Debt Offer and
Consent Solicitation, and the Company shall incorporate all material comments
that are reasonable and timely requested by Buyer. The Company shall, and
shall cause Mueller Group to, promptly correct any information in the Offer
Documents or such other mailing that shall be or have become false
or misleading in any material respect.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 11.04, Buyer shall pay all costs incurred in
connection with the Debt Offer and the Consent Solicitation, including all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Company (or
Mueller Group) in connection with the Debt Offer and the Consent Solicitation
and the printing and mailing of all materials relating to the Debt Offer and
the Consent Solicitation. The Company agrees (and agrees to cause Mueller
Group) to retain any dealer manager, banker or other advisor to the
Company or Mueller Group (other than counsel) reasonably acceptable to the
Company or Mueller Group, as may be requested by Buyer at Buyers expense.

  



  

(e) At Buyers request, the Company shall, and shall cause Mueller Group to,
cooperate with Buyer in causing the satisfaction and discharge and/or
covenant defeasance provisions of the Second Priority Notes and the indenture
(the " **Discharge/Defeasance** ") pursuant to which they were issued to be
satisfied on the date of the Closing; _provided_ that Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall have sole responsibility for making any payments to the
Trustee and otherwise satisfying

  



  

50   

      
  

  



  

the requirements and conditions that must be satisfied in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding Section 11.04, Buyer shall pay all
costs incurred in connection with such satisfaction and discharge or covenant
defeasance, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Companys
outside counsel, accountants and/or financial advisors to the extent that
Buyer requests one or more of them to prepare or deliver any documentation
required in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 6.07 _. Termination of Affiliate Agreements. _Except as set forth on
Schedule 6.07, the Company shall, and shall cause any applicable Company
Subsidiary to, terminate, as of the Closing, the agreements, contracts,
commitments and other transactions with DLJMB and its Affiliates contemplated
by Section 3.23.

  



  

ARTICLE 7 
 COVENANTS OF BUYER

  



  

Section 7.01 _. Confidentialit_ _y. _Prior to the Effective Time and after
any termination of this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates will hold in
confidence, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2005, all confidential documents and
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary furnished to, or
prepared by, Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. If this Agreement is terminated,
Buyer and its Affiliates will destroy or deliver to the Company, upon
request, all documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, prepared
or obtained by Buyer or its Affiliates or on their behalf from the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in connection with the Transaction Agreements that are
subject to such confidence.

  



  

Section 7.02. _Access_. Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and
each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, at and after the Effective
Time, to afford promptly to the Stockholders Representative and its agents
reasonable access to their properties, books, records, employees and auditors
to the extent necessary to permit the Stockholders Representative and its
agents to determine any matter relating to its (or any holders of Shares
and/or Company Warrants) rights and obligations hereunder or relating to any
period ending at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that any such
access by the Stockholders Representative and its agents shall
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Surviving Corporation or any such Subsidiary. The Stockholders
Representative agrees to hold, and will use all reasonable efforts to cause
its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of law, all
confidential

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

documents and information concerning the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation provided to it pursuant to this
Section.

  



  

Section 7.03 _. Employees and O_ _ffers of Employment. _(a)
Buyer acknowledges that, subject to the last sentence of Section 7.03(b),
it shall, through the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, continue
the employment of all of the employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the "
**Transferred Employees** ").

  



  

(b) Until at least the end of the 12-month period immediately following the
Effective Time, and except as to those Transferred Employees whose terms and
conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement as
such may exist at the Effective Time (" **Union Employees** "), (i)
Buyer agrees to provide, or to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to provide, each Transferred Employee with base pay that is no
less than the base pay of the Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) Buyer agrees to, or to cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide a total incentive compensation
opportunity that is not less than the total incentive opportunity that would
be provided pursuant to the applicable Employee Plan disclosed on Schedule
3.20(a) in effect as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that until
September 30, 2005, the annual incentive compensation shall be determined
pursuant to the applicable Employee Plan disclosed on Schedule 3.20(a) in
effect as of the date hereof, but that for the remainder of the 12-month
period immediately following the Effective Time, the total incentive
opportunity shall be determined by using updated financial performance
metrics for the Company and under bonus plans of Buyer using performance
metrics consistent with those used for similarly situated employees of Buyer
and the form in which such bonuses, if any, will be paid shall be consistent
with the overall bonus and incentive compensation programs of Buyer (and may
be paid in cash, equity or other equity-related types of awards). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an express or
implied promise of continued employment for any period or at all and will not
interfere in any way with an employers right to dismiss a Transferred
Employee or Union Employee from employment at any time, with or without
cause, other than as prohibited by applicable law.

  



  

Section 7.04 _. Company Em_ _ployee Plans. _Buyer agrees to honor, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under the
provisions of each Employee Plan and collective bargaining agreement as such
Employee Plan or agreement relates to each Transferred Employee or
Union Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Section
7.04 is intended to prevent Buyer from amending or terminating any such
Employee Plan in accordance with its terms, so long as, through the end of
the 12-month period

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

immediately following the Effective Time, the benefits provided to
Transferred Employees (other than Union Employees) under all Employee Plans
(including severance, but excluding any plans related to or denominated with
regard to the equity of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other
entity, other than as described in Section 7.03(b)) are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those generally provided to the Transferred
Employees (other than Union Employees) immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

Section 7.05 _. Buyer Employe_ _e Plans. _(a) Buyer or one of its Affiliates
will recognize all service of the Transferred Employees to the extent such
service is recognized by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for all
purposes of the employee benefit plans of Buyer or its Affiliates (other than
benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates).

  



  

(b) Within 60 days after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cover, or cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to cover, Transferred Employees
under one or more defined contribution plans and trusts intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code (collectively, the "
**Buyer DC Plan** "). To the extent relevant, the Surviving Corporation
shall permit such Transferred Employees to make a "direct rollover" of their
account balances under the Companys 401(k) plan to the Buyer DC Plan in
cash. The Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good
faith to effect such transfers or distributions as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 7.06 _. No Third P_ _arty Beneficiaries Regarding Employment Matters.
_Without limiting Section 7.10 or 11.12, Buyer and the Company acknowledge
and agree that all provisions contained in this Article 7 with respect to
employees are included for the sole benefit of Buyer and the Company and
shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including, without
limitation, any current or former employees, any participant in any Employee
Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, or shall interfere with Buyers
right to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan (subject in each case
to the provisions of Sections 7.03, 7.04 and 7.05) or to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason, other than as prohibited by
applicable law.

  



  

Section 7.07 _. Obligat_ _ions of MergerCo and Surviving Corporation. _Buyer
agrees to cause MergerCo to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.08 _. Offer for N_ _otes. _As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but in no event later than 60 days thereafter, Buyer
shall, or shall

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

cause the Surviving Corporation to, commence a tender offer pursuant to the
"change of control" provisions in the applicable Indenture (the " **Tender
Offer** ") for all of the Notes (other than the Second Priority Notes to the
extent no longer required under the terms of such Notes).  The Tender Offer
shall be made by means of an offer to purchase and shall comply with the
provisions of the applicable Indenture pursuant to which each series of the
Notes has been issued and all applicable laws, including the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the Tender Offer is
made by Buyer, Buyer shall accept and pay for all Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the Tender Offer.  If the
Tender Offer is made by the Surviving Corporation, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to accept and pay for, and shall provide the Surviving
Corporation with funds sufficient to pay for, all Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the Tender Offer.

  



  

Section 7.09 _. Repayment of_ _Senior Indebtedness; Payment of Transaction
Expenses. _(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, on behalf of the Company, or
shall provide the Company (or Mueller Group) with funds sufficient to repay
in full the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries arising
pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company (or Mueller Group) shall pay all such obligations in full.
On or prior to the fifth business day prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer copies of a customary pay-off letter from the
Administrative Agent under the Senior Credit Agreement and shall have made
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Buyer for the release of all Liens

securing such obligations.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, on behalf of the Company, or shall
provide the Company with funds sufficient to pay, all Transaction Expenses.

City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction
over such Dispute, suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action
arising out of the Transaction Agreements shall be deemed to have arisen from
a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Dispute, suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by

**Claimant** ") may initiate the Dispute resolution procedures of this
Section 11.10 by providing written notice (the " **Notice of Claim** ") to
the other party (the " **Respondent** ") identifying the nature and scope of
the Dispute and stating the desire to resolve the Dispute. Insofar as
is practicable, any documentation that supports the Claimants Notice of
Claim shall be included with said Notice of Claim.  Within 15 days after
receiving the Notice of Claim, Respondent will respond in writing by stating
its position (including any related claims it may have) and setting forth a
proposed resolution of the Dispute. Insofar as is practicable, any
documentation that supports the Respondents defense shall be included with
such response. If Claimant and Respondent are not able to resolve the Dispute
within 10 days thereafter, then the parties shall proceed in accordance with
the provisions of Section 11.10(b) hereof.

  



  

65   

     
   

  



  

(b) If a Dispute is not promptly resolved after the submission of the Notice
of Claim and response specified in Section 11.10(a), then each party shall
promptly nominate a senior officer of its management to meet to resolve the
Dispute.

  



  

(c) If the parties have not resolved the Dispute within 15 days after the
date of the commencement of informal resolution proceedings set forth in
Section 11.10(b) above, then either party may initiate arbitration of the
Dispute by notifying the other party in writing that arbitration of the
Dispute is demanded. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with
the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution Rules for Non-Administered
Arbitration (the " **Rules** ") by one arbitrator. Unless the parties agree
on an individual arbitrator by name, each party shall appoint one
arbitrator, obtain its appointees acceptance of such appointment, and
deliver written notification of such appointment and acceptance to the other
party within 10 days after delivery of the written notice demanding
arbitration. The two party-appointed arbitrators shall then jointly appoint a
third arbitrator, obtain the appointees acceptance of such appointment and
notify the parties in writing of such appointment and acceptance within 10
days after their appointment and acceptance. The arbitrator appointed by the
two party-appointed arbitrators shall serve as the sole arbitrator. If the
party appointed arbitrators fail to appoint an arbitrator within the time
limits specified herein, the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution shall
appoint the arbitrator in accordance with Article 6 of the Rules.
The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§
1-16, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
by any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Unless otherwise agreed, the
place of the arbitration shall be New York City, New York. The parties agree
and consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for
the purpose of enforcing this Section 11.10 and for the purpose of
confirming an award and entering judgment upon said award, and the parties
further waive all objections to jurisdiction and venue in any such courts.

  



  

(d) All Dispute resolution costs, which shall include any fee for the
arbitrator for services rendered, shall be borne equally by the parties.
 Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses.

  



  

Section 11.11. _WAIVE_ _R OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING

HEREBY.

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Buyer, JW MergerCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("

June 17, 2005 (the " **Merger Agreement** ") pursuant to which MergerCo will
merge with and into the Company, in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware and the stockholders of the Company will receive
cash in consideration for such merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Merger Agreement, the Company as

(b) It is expressly agreed and understood that the Escrow Amount shall,

claims, liabilities and reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees of
its counsel, which it may suffer or incur hereunder, or in connection
herewith, except such as shall result solely and directly from its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  The Escrow Agent shall not be bound in any

 ** _Schedule 2.04 - Share Consideration_**

  



  

The Share Consideration shall be calculated as follows:

  



       

Share  Consideration =

    |  

Adjusted Price

    |  



    
---|---|--- 
     



    |  

Full Dilution Number

    |  



    
   



  

Adjusted Price = $1,912,500,000 _plus_ (i) the aggregate exercise price of
the Company Warrants, (ii) Closing Cash* and (iii) if Closing Working
Capital* exceeds Benchmark Working Capital, the amount of such difference,
_less_ (i) if Benchmark Working Capital exceeds Closing Working Capital*, the
amount of such difference, (ii) Indebtedness and (iii) Transaction Expenses

  



  

Benchmark

  

Working Capital = $359,800,000

  



  

Benchmark Working Capital was determined by adding the amount of accounts
receivables (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), inventories, prepaid
expenses and other current assets (other than cash and cash equivalents,
income taxes receivable and deferred income taxes), and subtracting therefrom
the sum of accounts payable (other than any accounts payable in respect of
Transaction Expenses), accrued expenses and other current liabilities (other
than current portion of long-term debt), in each case as set forth on the
Balance Sheet.

  



  

   

* The Adjusted Price and the Share Consideration at the Effective Time shall be determined using Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated Working Capital.
