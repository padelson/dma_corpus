 WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, including _Annex A_ hereto, Merger Sub has agreed to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) an offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase for cash all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Companys Common Stock (as defined below), at a price of $8.60 per share, or any higher price per share of Common Stock paid by Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Offer for shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ "), acting upon the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors of the Company (the " _Special Committee_ "), has (i) determined that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared this Agreement advisable, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and (iii) determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant thereto and, to the extent applicable, to adopt this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent and Merger Sub are unwilling to enter into this Agreement (and effect the transactions contemplated hereby) unless, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, certain directors and executive officers of the Company enter into Stockholder Agreements substantially in the form of _Annex B_ hereto (collectively, the " _Stockholder Agreements_ ") and, in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, such Persons are executing and delivering the Stockholder Agreements to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently herewith; and

ARTICLE I 

   

THE TENDER OFFER AND MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1. _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ and that none of the events set forth in _Annex A_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, within ten Business Days after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub (and the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub) to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company at the purchase price of $8.60 per share of Common Stock (such price, or any higher price per share of Common Stock paid by Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Offer, the " _Per Share Amount_ ") and shall, upon commencement of the Offer but after affording the Company reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") and all other necessary documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and make all deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, in each case in connection with the Offer (the " _Offer Documents_ "), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall, upon the expiration of the Offer, accept for payment, and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax), all Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn on the Acceptance Date. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered shall be subject solely to the satisfaction of the Tender Offer Conditions. The Per Share Amount shall be net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or stock transfer Taxes payable by such seller. No Shares held by the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be tendered pursuant to the Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that Restricted Shares may be tendered in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (b) Parent on behalf of Merger Sub expressly reserves the right from time to time, subject to  _Sections 1.1(c)_ and _1.1(d)_ , in its sole discretion, to waive any Tender Offer Condition, to increase the Per Share Amount or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to (i) decrease the Per Share Amount or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex A_ ), (iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer, (v) make any change in the Offer that would require an extension or delay of the then current Expiration Date (other than an increase in the Per Share Amount); _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (v) shall not limit the right of Parent and Merger Sub to extend the Expiration Date as required or permitted by _Section 1.1(d)_, (vi) modify or amend the Tender Offer Conditions (other than to waive such Tender Offer Conditions, other than the Minimum Condition), or (vii) modify or amend any other term of the Offer, in the case of this clause (vii), in any manner (A) adverse to the holders of Shares or (B) 

    ##### 

  

 

that would reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) No agreement or representation hereby is made or shall be made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company expressly for inclusion in, or with respect to Company information derived from the Companys public SEC filings that is included or incorporated by reference in, the Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and Merger Sub shall, and Parent further agrees to cause Merger Sub to, take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any Offer Documents (including each amendment or supplement thereto), and shall provide any comments thereon as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, before they are filed with the SEC. Merger Sub shall, and Parent agrees to cause Merger Sub to, provide the Company with (in writing, if written), and to consult with the Company regarding, any comments (written or oral) that may be received by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral comments and proposed responses. 

   

 (d) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth business day (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act, " _Business Day_ ") following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Merger Sub shall not and Parent agrees that it shall cause Merger Sub to not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection with the effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may, without Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Expiration Date for any period required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or the NASDAQ applicable to the Offer, including in connection with an increase in the Per Share Amount, (ii) extend the Expiration Date if on any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived by Parent, for such periods for up to five (5) Business Days at a time (or such longer period as shall be approved by the Company) as Merger Sub may deem reasonably necessary, but, except as provided in  _Section 1.1(d)(iii)_ or as required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or the NASDAQ applicable to the Offer (including in connection with an increase in the Per Share Amount), in no event may the Expiration Date be extended to a date later than the End Date, or (iii) extend the Expiration Date beyond the End Date for up to a period not to exceed the period which ends on the 15th Business Day after the date that either (w) the Company shall have publicly announced the receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal in the event such announcement is made less than ten Business Days prior to the End Date, (x) the Company publicly announces its reaffirmation of its approval or recommendation of the Offer following the public announcement of the receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal in the event that such reaffirmation or announcement is made less than ten Business Days prior to 

    ##### 

  

 

the End Date, (y) the Board of Directors shall have withdrawn or adversely
modified, made a public statement or taken a public position inconsistent
with the Recommendation at any time within ten Business Days prior to the End
Date or (z) any Notice of Superior Proposal is given by the Company in
accordance with _Section 6.3(e)_ if such notice is received by Parent less
than ten Business Days prior to the End Date. Except as expressly provided in
this _Section 1.1(d)_ , Parent shall not extend the Offer if all of the
Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived and it is permitted under
applicable Law to accept for payment and pay for validly tendered Shares that
are not validly withdrawn. 

   

 (e) In the event the Acceptance Date occurs but Merger Sub does not acquire a sufficient number of Shares to enable a Short-Form Merger to occur pursuant to _Section 2.8_ hereof, Merger Sub may (in its sole discretion), and Parent may (in its sole discretion) cause Merger Sub to, provide a "subsequent offering period" for a number of days to be determined by Parent but not less than three nor more than 20 Business Days in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (f) Promptly upon the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Tender Offer Conditions in accordance with _Section 1.1(b)_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "), (ii) on the Acceptance Date, deposit with the depositary engaged by Merger Sub in connection with the Offer, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Amount for all such accepted Shares and (iii) as soon as practicable following such deposit, cause the depositary to pay for all Shares so accepted for payment.

The Company agrees to mail such Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company along with the Offer Documents promptly after the commencement of the Offer. Subject to any Recommendation Withdrawal in accordance with this Agreement, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall contain the Recommendation.

 Section 1.3. _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) _Grant of Top-Up Option_. The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Per Share Amount (the " _Per Common Share Price_ "), a number of newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Class A Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised at any time on or after any Expiration Date hereunder and on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later to occur of the Expiration Date or the expiration date of any subsequent offering period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no provision of any applicable Law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require approval by the Companys stockholders under applicable Law or regulation (including NASDAQ rules and regulations), (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub constitutes one share of Class A Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (D) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock not otherwise reserved for issuance for outstanding Company Stock Options or other obligations of the Company, (E) Merger Sub has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn, and (F) the number of shares tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn shall be not less than 70% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the Top Up Option. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. 

   

 (b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with _Section 1.3(a)_, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock expected to be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Merger Sub of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to this _Section 1.3_, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid, at the election of Merger Sub or Parent, by Merger Sub by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to 3%, shall mature on the first anniversary of 

    ##### 

  

 

the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty. 

   

 (c) _Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization_. In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company that would have the effect of diluting Merger Subs rights under the Top-Up Option, the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the Per Common Share Price shall be adjusted appropriately so as to restore Merger Sub to its rights hereunder with respect to the Top-Up Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 1.3_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 1.4. _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the payment by Parent or Merger Sub for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer which represent at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and from time to time thereafter, as shares of Common Stock are acquired by Parent or Merger Sub, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors as will give Parent representation on the Board of Directors equal to at least that number of directors which equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as officers of the Company), multiplied by (ii) the percentage (the " _Board Percentage_ ") that the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any of their affiliates (including for purposes of this _Section 1.4_ such shares of Common Stock as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer) bears to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors (as long as Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates own a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors shall always have at least three directors who are directors on the date hereof and who are neither officers of the Company nor designees, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the Federal securities laws) of Parent (one or more of such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_   _further_ , that if there are in office fewer than three Independent Directors, the Board of Directors shall take all actions necessary to cause a person or, if there are two vacancies, two persons designated by the remaining Independent Director(s) to fill such vacancy(ies) who shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, affiliate or associate of Parent, and each such person(s) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, or, if no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate three persons to fill the vacancies who shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, affiliate or associate of Parent, and each such person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. At each such time, the Company shall, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable Law or NASDAQ rules, also cause (x) each committee of the Board of Directors, (y) if requested by Parent, the board of directors of each of the Companys Subsidiaries and (z) if requested by Parent, each committee of such board of directors of each of the Companys 

    ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries to include persons designated by Parent constituting the Board
Percentage of each such committee or board as Parents designees constitute
on the Board of Directors. The Company shall, upon request by Parent, subject
to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, promptly increase the size of
the Board of Directors or exercise its reasonable best efforts to secure
the resignations of such number of directors as necessary to enable Parents
designees to be elected to the Board of Directors in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 1.4(a)_ and shall cause Parents designees to be so
elected. The Company shall promptly amend, or cause to be amended, its by-
laws, if necessary, to increase the size of the Board of Directors if such
increase is required to satisfy the Board Percentage pursuant to this
_Section 1.4_. The Company shall promptly take, at the Companys expense,
any lawful action necessary to effect any such election, including mailing to
its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder ( _provided_ that Parent has provided
the information described in the following sentence), unless such information
has previously been provided to the Companys stockholders in the Schedule
14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to (i) authorize any agreement between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and any of their affiliates (other than the Company and any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, (ii) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (iii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (iv) extend the time for performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder or (v) take any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Board of Directors. The Independent Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the Independent Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III 

   

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Class A Common Stock (such shares, together, unless the context clearly otherwise requires, with the associated Rights, collectively, the " _Common Stock_ ", and each, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive in cash an amount equal to the Per Share Amount (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof in cash, without any interest thereon, upon surrender and exchange of the Certificate representing such Share pursuant to the terms hereof. All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of Third Parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who are entitled to demand and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demands. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent, and is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or noncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article III_ (such cash being hereinafter 

    ##### 

  

 

referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent
directs. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall mail, to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_) to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares formerly represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to  _Section 3.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence, to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation, that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (iii) All cash paid upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented thereby. From and after the Effective Time, the 

   ##### 

  

    

holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to Shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law. 

  

 (iv) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement (whether pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise) to any holder of Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares) or holder of Company Stock Options, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holder of the Company Stock Options, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation or by book-entry of the Shares, other than transfers that occurred before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this _Article III_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this  _Section 3.2_ and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holder after the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration. 

    ##### 

  

  

 Section 3.3. _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. 

  

 (a) Each option, prior to the Effective Time, to purchase Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any equity based compensation plan (including the Companys employee stock purchase plans) of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will at the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of such Company Stock Option will, in full settlement of such Company Stock Option, receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the case of any Company Stock Option that does not explicitly provide for the cash out of such stock option as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_, the Company shall obtain, prior to the Acceptance Date, a waiver and release from the holders of all such Company Stock Options, except as provided below in this  _Section 3.3(a),_ in exchange for the Option Consideration; in any case where the Option Consideration is zero or negative, the Company shall offer the stock option holder an amount of cash (the " _Stock Option Cash Out Consideration_ ") as determined by the Company and the applicable stock option holder as necessary to obtain the waiver and release as contemplated herein and the Company shall pay to such holders the Stock Option Cash Out Consideration prior to the Acceptance Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Stock Option Cash Out Consideration must be approved by Parent in writing prior to any payment thereof.

None of the Board of Directors, any committee thereof or the Company itself, shall agree with any Person to limit or not to give prior notice to Parent and Merger Sub of its intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding _Sections 6.3(a)(iii)_ and _6.3(a)(iv)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_ , if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company receives a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_, the Board of Directors (or any duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors) may withdraw, modify, change, condition or qualify the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (" _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors (or any duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors) may not effect a Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ (i) unless the Company has complied with this _Section 6.3_ , (ii) until after the third Business Day following actual receipt by Parent by the Company of a Notice of Superior Proposal, (iii) unless either (A) on or before the expiration of the three (3) Business Day period following the actual receipt by Parent of the Notice of Superior Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (ii), Parent does not make a Matching Bid in response to such Superior Proposal or (B) following receipt of a Matching Bid within the three (3) Business Day period, the Board of Directors (or any duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors) concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and based on the advice of outside legal

counsel and after taking into consideration the Matching Bid, that the
Superior Proposal to which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues
to be a Superior Proposal and (iv) unless the Board of Directors (or any duly
constituted committee of the Board of Directors) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and based on the advice of
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal
in response to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Unless the Board of Directors has
previously effected a Recommendation Withdrawal, or is concurrently
therewith withdrawing, the Recommendation in accordance with this _Section
6.3_ and otherwise complies with _Section 6.3(e)_, neither the Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall recommend any Company Acquisition
Proposal to the stockholders of the Company or, except as otherwise permitted

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (or any duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors), after receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law. 

   

 (g) As used in this Agreement, the term: 

   

 (i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains provisions that, in the aggregate, are no less restrictive of and no more favorable to the Person (other than the Company) subject to such agreement than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and which contains additional provisions that expressly and solely permit the Company to comply with its obligations under this _Section 6.3_ _provided_  that the duration of the standstill agreement shall not be less than the duration of the standstill agreement contained in the Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party who has previously entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company relating to a purchase of, or business combination with, the Company shall not be required to enter into a new or revised confidentiality agreement if such existing confidentiality agreement contains provisions that satisfy the requirements for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement contained in the immediately preceding sentence;

 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Company Acquisition Proposal, (except that solely for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal" all references in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)" and all references to "the Company or any of its Subsidiaries" in clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed references to "the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole") that (a) the Board of Directors of the Company (or any duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors) concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and based on the advice of 

   ##### 

  

    

outside legal counsel, is on terms that are more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the stockholders of the Company than the terms of the

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the draft of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto). The Company shall provide Parent with copies of all filings made and correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed promptly by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company as soon as practicable. 

   

 (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Meeting_ "), (ii) cause the Proxy Statement to include the Recommendation and a copy of the opinion referred to in _Section 4.18_, and (iii) subject to _Section 6.3_, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is 

    ##### 

  

 

terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and subject to compliance with
_Section 8.3_ , the Company, regardless of whether the Board of Directors
(whether or not acting through the Special Committee, if such committee still
exists or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its disinterested
directors) has approved, endorsed or recommended a Company Acquisition
Proposal, or has withdrawn, modified, changed, conditioned or qualified the
Recommendation, will submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company
at the Company Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Short Form Merger may be effected
in accordance with _Section 2.8_ and Section 253 of the DGCL, the parties
hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective on the dates specified in _Section 2.2_ without a
Company Meeting, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

   

 Section 6.5. _Employee Matters_.

 (b) Upon and after the Closing Date, Parent shall continue to sponsor the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 6.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Continued Plans_ ") for the benefit of each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than such employees covered by collective bargaining agreements (the " _Company Employees_ "), in accordance with the terms of such Continued Plans. The Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in the Continued Plans from and after the Closing Date until such time that Parent suspends participation in or terminates such Continued Plans (the " _Transition Period_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon and after the Closing Date until May 1, 2008, Parent shall continue to sponsor, for the benefit of the Company Employees, those Continued Plans that solely provide for medical and dental benefits. Upon the expiration of the Transition Period, the Company Employees shall then be entitled to participate in the benefit plans and arrangements sponsored or maintained by Parent to the extent such plans or arrangements are made available to similarly situated employees of Parent (the " _New Plans_ "), subject to the terms and conditions of the New Plans. For purposes of eligibility to participate in the New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time. Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions of any New Plan to be waived for each Company Employee and his or her 

    ##### 

  

 

covered dependents unless such Company Employee, or dependent, as applicable,
would not be entitled to coverage for the condition if the covered employee
were employed by the Parent during the period for which credited service is
applied. 

   

 (c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries maintained pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under the Companys plan maintained pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation, or any affiliate thereof, to terminate any Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.5_, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing Date. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_ with respect to Employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Employees, former Employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective affiliates or continued participation in any Company Benefit Plan.

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts promptly to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Specified Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time 

    ##### 

  

 

any fee, penalty or other consideration to any Third Party, other than a
Governmental Entity, for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
contract or agreement (other than de minimis amounts or if Parent and
Merger Sub have provided adequate assurance of repayment). No party shall
take any action that is intended or would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in any of the Tender Offer
Conditions or the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ not
being satisfied or the satisfaction of those conditions being materially
delayed. 

   

 (b) On or before January 18, 2008, each party hereto shall file, or cause to be filed by their respective "ultimate parent entities", with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, any Notification and Report Forms and related material required to be filed by it under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and thereafter shall promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable and to respond on a timely basis to any requests for additional information made by either of such agencies.

 (c) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the required waiting period under the HSR Act, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries shall not take any action that would reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust Law. 

   

 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, until the Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms the Company and Parent shall (i) cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any Third Parties in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation and effectiveness of, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (ii) supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental Entity and (iii) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Offer and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any Law with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Expiration Date and the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date). 

     ##### 

 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any terms contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub, Parent and its other Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to agree to (x) the sale, divestiture or disposition of any material assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (y) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or controlled affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines, services or assets; nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its affiliates, unless (but only if Parent grants its written consent in Parents sole and absolute discretion) such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs. 

   

 (f) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including to the extent permitted by Law and with the exception of the HSR filings and competitively sensitive documents promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications sent or received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to or from any Third Party with respect to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law and to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication to any supervisory or Governmental Entity with the exception of HSR filings and competitively sensitive documents. To the extent practicable, each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in Person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with such transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. 

   

 (g) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this  _Section 6.6_, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.6_. 

   

 Section 6.7. _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards of directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly

to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 6.8. _Public Announcements_.

For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees listed in _Section 6.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Closing Date were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

 (b) The Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in 

   ##### 

  

   

settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred before the
Closing Date (including acts or omissions in connection with such
persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (and following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without either Parents or the Companys (and following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporations) prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the Company (and following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single such Action, unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate.
It shall be a condition to the advancement of any amounts to be paid in
respect of legal and other fees and expenses that the Company (and following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) receive an undertaking by the
Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid
in advance if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law. In the event of any such
Action, the Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Action. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Company (and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in either case of substantially the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not materially less advantageous in the aggregate than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage maintained by the Company on the date of this Agreement with respect to matters arising on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Acceptance Date, the Company (and following the Effective time, the Surviving Corporation) shall not be required (and, prior to the Effective Time, shall not be permitted) to pay with respect to such current or substitute insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; and _further_ _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time if the Surviving Corporation purchases a six-year "tail policy" and the same coverage costs more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of "tail" coverage that can be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement with respect to matters arising on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ that the cost of such tail policy shall not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the 

    ##### 

  

    

Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full
term. 

   

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. Subsequent amendment of the Certificates of Incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of the Surviving Corporation shall not diminish or impair the rights of any Indemnified Party. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

Parent may participate in (but not control) the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Stockholder Agreement at Parents sole cost and expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that without Parents prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall not enter into or agree to any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment of the validity of any such stockholder litigation matter if such settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement would impose injunctive or other non-monetary relief or other duties or obligations on the Company and its Subsidiaries that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or would continue following the Closing Date and; _provided_ _further_ , that without Parents prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall not enter into or agree to any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment of the validity of any such stockholder litigation matter if such settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement would result in a payment obligation by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of more than 

   ##### 

  

 

$500,000. In addition, subject to _Section 6.3_, the Company shall not
voluntarily cooperate with any Third Party which has sought or may hereafter
seek to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Stockholder
Agreement and shall cooperate with Parent to resist any such effort to
restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Stockholder Agreement. The
Company may participate in (but not control) decisions relating to any

 Section 6.13. _Termination of Credit Agreement and Funded Indebtedness_. On or prior to the second Business Day prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters, in reasonable form, from the holders of any Funded Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement. On the Acceptance Date, the Company shall repay all such Funded Indebtedness, terminate the Credit Agreement and the Loan Agreement, and obtain the release of all mortgages, liens and other security over the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties and assets securing such obligations (other than the filing of Form UCC-3s).

In addition, if the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall fail to pay such fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, when due, then, as applicable, the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall also pay to the other party all of
