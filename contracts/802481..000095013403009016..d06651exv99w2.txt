         3.1      PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price payable by Buyer for the
                  Stock (the "Purchase Price") shall be an amount equal to Final
                  Adjusted Net Book Value, as set forth in the Final Adjusted
                  Net Book Value Calculation.

         3.2      ESTIMATED CLOSING BALANCE SHEET. On the fourth (4th) business
                  day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
                  deliver an estimated combined consolidated balance sheet for
                  the Business (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), along
                  with an estimate of the calculation of Adjusted Net Book
                  Value, which shall be prepared pursuant to the provisions of
                  Section 5.1(a) using the amounts reflected on the Estimated
                  Closing Balance Sheet, both of which shall be estimated as of
                  the Closing Date. Seller shall prepare the Estimated Closing
                  Balance Sheet in good faith and in accordance with Applicable
                  Accounting Principles. Buyer and its representatives shall
                  have the right to consult with Seller in connection with the
                  preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet but shall
                  not have the right to approve the Estimated Closing Balance
                  Sheet.

         3.3      PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price shall be
                  paid as follows:

                  3.3.1    CASH PAYMENT. $100,000,000 shall be paid by Buyer to
                           Seller in cash at Closing (the "Cash Payment").

                  3.3.2    BUYER'S SHARES. A portion of the Purchase Price (the
                           "Share Amount") shall be paid by Buyer issuing and
                           delivering to Seller at Closing shares of Buyer's
                           Class A common stock (the "Shares"). The number of
                           Shares to be issued to Seller at Closing shall be
                           equal to the lesser of 39,400,000 or the number of
                           Shares determined by dividing (i) forty-five percent
                           (45%) of the Estimated Purchase Price by (ii) the
                           greater of (1) the volume weighted average trading
                           price of

                           Exchange, as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., during the
                           period from the first trading day following the date
                           the parties publicly announce their signing of this
                           Agreement through the date that is five (5) trading
                           days prior to the Closing Date (the "Average Price")
                           and (2) $5.35. The value of such Shares for purposes
                           of determining the amount of the Subordinated
                           Promissory Note shall be equal to such number of
                           Shares multiplied by the greater of the Average Price
                           and $5.35.

                  3.3.3    SUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTE. The balance of the
                           Purchase Price shall be paid by Buyer executing and
                           delivering to Seller the Subordinated Promissory Note
                           in the principal amount of such balance. The
                           principal balance of the Subordinated Promissory Note
                           delivered at Closing shall be based upon the
                           Estimated Purchase Price, and shall subsequently be
                           adjusted to reflect the final Purchase Price in
                           accordance with Section 5.2.

                  3.3.4    SHARE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. Notwithstanding anything to
                           the contrary in this Agreement, in the event the
                           Average Price is less than $5.35, then, at Buyer's
                           option, by written notice to Seller delivered not
                           more than three (3) business days prior to the
                           Closing Date specifying which option Buyer elects,
                           one of the following shall apply: (i) Buyer shall
                           issue to Seller that number of additional Shares
                           equal to (x) the amount by which $5.35 exceeds the
                           Average Price, multiplied by the number of Shares
                           determined in accordance with Section 3.3.2

                           (the "Share Price Adjustment") divided by (y) the
                           Average Price; (ii) Buyer shall issue to Seller
                           additional subordinated debt on the same terms as the
                           Subordinated Promissory Note, the principal amount of

                           shall deliver to Seller a combination of the forms of
                           additional consideration referred to in clauses (i),
                           (ii) and (iii) above having an aggregate value equal
                           to the Share Price Adjustment, such aggregate value
                           determined by adding (a) the amount of cash, if any,
                           (b) the principal amount of additional subordinated
                           debt, if any, and (c) the number of additional
                           shares, if any, multiplied by the Average Price; (v)
                           Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree that Buyer
                           shall deliver to Seller some other consideration
                           having a value equal to the Share Price Adjustment;
                           or (vi) Buyer may terminate this Agreement in
                           accordance with Section 11.1(g) hereof, unless Seller
                           agrees in writing, within 48 hours after receipt of
                           written notice from Buyer of its intent to terminate
                           this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(g), that the
                           Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
                           the Share Price Adjustment, in which case Seller will
                           not be entitled to the Share Price Adjustment and
                           this Agreement will not be terminated pursuant to
                           Section 11.1(g).

                  3.3.5    ASSET RETENTION. Notwithstanding anything to the
                           contrary in this

                           that, the Purchase Price as determined pursuant to

                           Price as determined pursuant to the terms and
                           conditions of this Agreement but for the application
                           of this Section 3.3.5, (ii) the Moorefield, West

                           prior to the Effective Time and (iv) reduce Net Book
                           Value by the amount, if any, by which the Discount
                           Amount exceeds the Impairment Charge. The "Impairment
                           Charge" shall mean the impairment charge with respect
                           to the Business arising after April 20, 2003 as
                           reflected in the audited financial statements for the
                           fiscal year ended May 25, 2003 referred to in Section
                           9.15 of this Agreement so long as the impairment
                           charge pertains to the write-off of no more than
                           $36,343,582 of goodwill. If the impairment charge
                           pertains to the write-off of more than $36,343,582 in
                           goodwill, then for purposes of this definition, the
                           impairment charge shall be reduced by an amount equal
                           to the excess of the goodwill write-off included in
                           the impairment charges over $36,343,582. Buyer shall
                           consult with Seller in good faith in connection with

                           Seller and Buyer its draft preliminary audit report

                           have been resolved in accordance with Section 5.1(d)
                           and such resolution is incorporated into the
                           Preliminary Audited Closing Balance Sheet. Seller

                           writing within sixty (60) calendar days after
                           delivery of the Preliminary Audited Closing Balance
                           Sheet and revised calculation of Adjusted Net Book
                           Value that such party objects to the calculation
                           contained therein, specifying in detail each
                           objection and the basis for each objection, the
                           Preliminary Audited Closing Balance Sheet shall be
                           issued in final form by Deloitte and such Preliminary
                           Audited Balance Sheet and revised calculation of
                           Adjusted Net Book Value shall be final and binding
                           upon the parties. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have
                           the right to dispute the principles and procedures
                           used in the preparation of the Preliminary Audited
                           Closing Balance Sheet so long as the principles and
                           procedures used are consistent with the Applicable
                           Accounting Principles; provided that the foregoing
                           shall in no event effect the right of Seller or Buyer
                           to object to any estimates or judgments made in
                           connection with the preparation of the Preliminary
                           Audited Closing Balance Sheet. If Buyer and Seller
                           are unable to resolve the disputed items within
                           thirty (30) calendar days after any such notification
                           has been given (or within such extended time period
                           as is mutually agreed to by the parties), the
                           unresolved disputed items shall be referred for a
                           final determination to a mutually acceptable
                           independent accountant. Such determination shall be
                           final and binding upon the parties, absent manifest
                           error. Such accountant shall be jointly retained by
                           the

                           parties hereto on a mutually acceptable basis and
                           Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half of the fees
                           and expenses of such accountant. Promptly following
                           the date that Seller and Buyer reach agreement upon
                           the disputed items pursuant to Section 5.1(d), or, if
                           applicable, the date of the final determination of
                           such accountant of the disputed items pursuant to
                           Section 5.1(d), the parties shall cause such
                           resolution to be incorporated into the Preliminary
                           Audited Closing Balance Sheet and shall cause
                           Deloitte to issue its final audit report and final
                           revised calculation of Adjusted Net Book Value. The
                           Preliminary Audited Closing Balance Sheet, as may be
                           adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof (the "Final
                           Closing Balance Sheet"), and Deloitte's final revised
                           calculation of Adjusted Net Book Value, as
                           appropriately modified to reflect any changes (the
                           "Final Adjusted Net Book Value Calculation"), shall
                           be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
                           hereunder.

         5.2      SETTLEMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. On the second business day
                  following (i) the expiration of sixty (60) calendar days
                  following delivery of the Preliminary Audited Closing Balance
                  Sheet to Buyer and Seller if neither Seller nor Buyer has
                  objected to the Preliminary Audited Closing Balance Sheet, or
                  (ii) if either Seller or Buyer shall have objected to the
                  Preliminary Audited Closing Balance Sheet, final determination
                  of the disputed items pursuant to Section 5.1(d), Buyer shall
                  deliver to Seller a revised Subordinated Promissory Note in
                  exchange for the Subordinated Promissory Note delivered to
                  Seller at Closing, which Seller shall deliver to Buyer for





                                      -30-

                  cancellation. Such revised Subordinated Promissory Note will
                  reflect the principal outstanding equal to the Final Adjusted
                  Net Book Value, less the sum of (i) the Share Amount, (ii) the
                  Cash Payment and (iii) the Share Price Adjustment, if
                  applicable pursuant to Section 3.3.4 (such difference being
                  referred to as the "Adjustment Amount"). This revised
                  Subordinated Promissory Note shall otherwise be on the same
                  terms and conditions as the Subordinated Promissory Note
                  delivered by Buyer to Seller and substituted for the
                  Subordinated Promissory Note delivered by Buyer at Closing. As
                  used herein, "Final Adjusted Net Book Value" shall mean Net
                  Book Value, as of the Closing Date, as reflected in the Final
                  Adjusted Net Book Value Calculation. If the Adjustment Amount
                  is a negative number, then Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer
                  an amount of cash equal to the Adjustment Amount and return to
                  Buyer for cancellation the Subordinated Promissory Note
                  delivered by Buyer to Seller at Closing. To the extent the
                  revised Subordinated Promissory Note shall have a principal
                  amount that is less than the principal amount of the
                  Subordinated Promissory Note delivered by Buyer at Closing,
                  Seller shall refund to Buyer any interest previously paid by
                  Buyer on such excess amount, and shall cancel any accrued but
                  unpaid interest payable by Buyer on such excess amount (or, if
                  not permitted by the Subordinated Promissory Note, repay to
                  Buyer such interest after payment of such interest by Buyer)
                  with respect to periods ending prior to the date of
                  substitution. To the extent the revised Subordinated
                  Promissory Note shall have a principal amount that exceeds



                                      -31-
<PAGE>

                  the principal amount of the Subordinated Promissory Note
                  delivered by Buyer at Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller, on
                  the next succeeding interest payment date under the terms of
                  the Subordinated Promissory Note, interest at the rate
                  specified in the Subordinated Promissory Note on the amount of
                  such difference with respect to the period beginning on the
                  Closing Date and ending prior to the date of substitution.
                  Seller agrees that it shall not sell or otherwise transfer the
                  Subordinated Promissory Note until the Final Adjusted Net Book
                  Value is determined in accordance with this Section 5.2 and
                  the exchange of notes contemplated by this Section 5.2 has
                  occurred.

         6.       EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

         6.1      GENERAL.

                  (a)      Continued Employment. As of the Effective Time, Buyer
                           will cause the Acquired Companies to provide
                           continuation of employment to each individual
                           employed by any of the Acquired Companies (or
                           otherwise in connection with the Business) on the
                           Closing Date (including employees absent from work
                           due to short-term or long term disability, sick
                           leave, military leave or other employer approved
                           absences of a short duration) other than those
                           employees employed in connection with the Retained
                           Businesses (the "Company Employees"). Notwithstanding
                           the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
                           shall prohibit Buyer from terminating or changing the
                           terms of employment of any Company Employee after the
                           Effective Time. Notwithstanding the preceding,
                           Company Employees on




                                      -32-
<PAGE>

                           long term disability on the Closing Date ("Disabled
                           Company Employees") will continue to be provided long
                           term disability benefits under the Seller's long term
                           disability plan, subject to the terms and conditions
                           of such plan, as long as the Disabled Company
                           Employee meets the conditions for benefits.

                  (b)      Retention Bonuses. Buyer shall be responsible for and
                           pay the Buyer Retention Obligations, provided that
                           Buyer's maximum aggregate liability for Buyer
                           Retention Obligations shall be $2,925,798. Seller
                           shall be responsible for and pay the Seller Retention
                           Obligations and any Buyer Retention Obligations that
                           exceed $2,925,798. Buyer shall be responsible for and
                           pay any other liabilities, obligations and claims of
                           any kind arising out of employment (or termination of
                           employment, whether actual or constructive) of the
                           Company Employees on and after the Closing Date
                           resulting from actions taken by Buyer. Seller agrees
                           that, from and after the Closing, it will not consent
                           to the termination of any Company Employee's
                           employment and that in the event prior to the first
                           anniversary of the Closing any Company Employee
                           voluntarily terminates his employment with an
                           Acquired Company, then upon the written request of
                           Buyer, Seller will assign to Buyer any rights Seller
                           may have to recover any Transaction Bonuses paid to
                           such Company Employee.

                  (c)      COBRA. Seller agrees to maintain the group health
                           plan continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B
                           of the Code and Sections 601-609 of ERISA for the
                           "qualifying beneficiaries" (within the meaning of
                           Section 4980B of the Code) and Company Employees who
                           are "covered employees"

                           (within the meaning of Section 4980B(f)(7) of the
                           Code) who experience a "qualifying event" (within the
                           meaning of Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) prior to
                           the Closing Date ("COBRA Participants"). Subject to
                           the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, the
                           parties agree that any Company Employee or qualifying
                           beneficiaries who becomes eligible for COBRA for the
                           period between the Closing Date and the later of (i)
                           December 31, 2003 and (ii) 120 days after the Closing
                           Date shall receive COBRA benefits from certain
                           benefit plans which will continue to be maintained by
                           the Seller. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all
                           costs and expenses incurred by Seller to maintain
                           continuation coverage for the COBRA Participants as
                           reasonably determined by Seller. Buyer shall
                           indemnify and hold Seller and Seller's Affiliates
                           harmless from and against any Liability Seller or
                           Seller's Affiliates incur at any time after Closing
                           under the provisions of Section 4980B of the Code or
                           Sections 601-609 of ERISA with respect to any covered
                           employee who is a Company Employee, or the qualified
                           beneficiary of any such employee, who has a
                           "qualifying event" on or after the Closing Date.

         6.2      SELLER PENSION PLANS.

                  (a)      Non-Union Employees. As of the Closing Date, the
                           Company Employees whose benefits are not governed by
                           a collective bargaining agreement shall cease to
                           actively participate in any pension plan offered by
                           Seller, any Acquired Company or any subsidiary
                           thereof, including but not limited to, (a) the
                           ConAgra Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and (b)
                           the ConAgra Pension Plan for Hourly Rate Production
                           Employees, in each case pursuant




                                      -34-

                           to the provisions in the plan documents and not
                           because of any amendment to either of the
                           aforementioned pension plans. The non-union Company
                           Employees described in the preceding sentence shall
                           receive no further benefit accrual under said pension
                           plans.

                  (b)      Union Employees. As of the Closing Date, the Company
                           Employees whose pension benefits are governed by a
                           collective bargaining agreement shall cease to
                           actively participate in any pension plan offered by
                           Seller, any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary
                           thereof and shall receive no further benefit accrual
                           thereunder. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
                           become the plan sponsor of the Retirement Income Plan
                           of Production Employees of Seaboard Farms of
                           Chattanooga, Inc. (the "Chattanooga Plan") with
                           respect to the Company Employees participating in
                           that plan and no further benefits shall accrue
                           thereunder with respect to any other employees of
                           Seller and its Affiliates. To the extent any Company
                           Employee whose benefits are governed by a collective
                           bargaining agreement is entitled to receive pension
                           benefits under a defined benefit plan after the
                           Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the
                           applicable collective bargaining agreement, Buyer
                           will provide such Company Employee his or her accrued
                           benefit (under the Chattanooga Plan) less any benefit
                           accrued under a defined benefit pension plan of
                           Seller as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
                           foregoing, if a Company Employee, whose pension
                           benefits are governed by a collective bargaining
                           agreement, is not vested in his or her accrued
                           benefit under a defined benefit pension plan of
                           Seller and if the vesting requirements are

                           of Buyer, then Seller shall cause the benefit accrued
                           under Seller's pension plan to be paid to such
                           Company Employee as if that benefit was fully vested
                           as of the Closing. As of the Closing, Seller will
                           provide Buyer with a list of Company Employees, whose

                           of such benefit as of the Closing Date. As of the
                           Closing Date, the union Company Employees at the
                           facilities located in Batesville and Clinton,

                           (the "Frozen Plan") so that, on or before the Closing
                           Date, it shall become the sponsor of that Frozen Plan
                           and the Company Employees will be eligible to receive
                           a distribution of their accounts in the Frozen Plan
                           within a reasonable period after the Closing Date.
                           Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in preparing
                           communications to Company Employees regarding the
                           distribution and their rollover options, including
                           Buyer's 401(k) plan.

                  Plan for Hourly Rate Production Employees (the "Seller 401(k)
                  Plans") and no further contributions shall be made to the
                  Seller 401(k) Plans for the benefit of the Company Employees.

                  Affiliates or to any plan of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
                  As soon as practical following receipt by Buyer and Seller of
                  favorable determination letters or Buyer's certification to
                  Seller, and Seller's certification to Buyer, in a manner
                  reasonably acceptable to both Seller and Buyer, that Buyer's
                  401(k) Plan and Seller's 401(k) plans are qualified under the
                  applicable provisions of the Code, and contingent on Buyer's
                  401(k) Plan administrator's ability to accept an in-kind
                  transfer of the assets (except for shares of Seller's stock)
                  and Seller's 401(k) Plan's ability to make an in-kind transfer
                  of assets, Seller shall cause the trustee of Seller's 401(k)
                  Plans to transfer, solely in the form of the mutual funds
                  currently available, cash from the sale of Seller's stock, or
                  notes representing outstanding participant loans or assets
                  representing the full account balances of the Company
                  Employees, and upon such transfer, Buyer and Buyer's 401(k)
                  Plan shall be responsible for proper administration of such
                  account balances and the related liability to the Company
                  Employees.

                  Employees participate in Seller's welfare benefit plans and

                  Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for all costs and expenses
                  (as reasonably determined by Seller) to maintain the continued
                  participation in such plans, and Seller agrees to modify its
                  welfare plans to permit the continued participation by the
                  Company Employees after the Closing Date. After the later of

                  local laws or ordinances (such laws collectively described as
                  the "WARN Act"). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
                  cooperate with the reasonable request of Buyer, to provide
                  notices and other communications to Company Employees in order

                  provided to the Company Employees after the Closing Date.

                  plans of the Seller as of the Closing Date. After the Closing

                  employee welfare benefit plans any amounts paid (or accrued)
                  by each Company Employee prior to Closing under welfare
                  benefit plans during the then current Plan Year and Seller

                  violation, conflict, default, right, cancellation or
                  acceleration, loss or Encumbrance that, individually or in the

                  operations, or capitalization of the Business or on the

                           authorization is required, except for those
                           jurisdictions in which failure to be so qualified or
                           authorized would not have a Company Material Adverse
                           Effect.

                  7.7.2    All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other

                           and the Applicable Accounting Principles, except in
                           the case of the Interim Financials, for normal
                           year-end adjustments that are not material and the
                           omission of footnote disclosures required by GAAP.
                           The Year-end Statements for 2001 and 2002 and the
                           Interim Financials do not contain any material
                           (individually or in the aggregate) items of

                           separately disclosed.

                           the Acquired Companies has any Liabilities of a type
                           required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared
                           in accordance with GAAP consistently applied except
                           those (i) set forth or provided for in the balance
                           sheet (including notes thereto) included in the
                           Interim Financials, (ii) incurred since April 20,
                           2003, in the ordinary course of business, or (iii)
                           recorded as part of normal year end adjustments.
                           Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation and
                           warranty is made pursuant to this Section 7.8.2 with
                           respect to any matter that is specifically addressed
                           by another representation or warranty contained in

                           accordance with their terms and at their recorded
                           amounts, in accordance with the Business' prior
                           practices, and (iii) between April 20, 2003 and the
                           date hereof, to the knowledge of Seller, neither
                           Seller nor any of its Affiliates has (a) permitted or
                           agreed to any extension in the time for payment of
                           receivables relating to the Business other than in
                           the ordinary course of business and consistent with
                           past practice or (b) changed its policies or
                           practices with respect to the extension of credit to

                           course of business and consistent with past practice.

                           after April 20, 2003.

                           for borrowed funds or purchase money indebtedness, or

                           paid or accrued. No Governmental Authority has
                           asserted any material claim for Taxes, or to the
                           Seller's knowledge has threatened to assert any
                           material claim for Taxes.

                  (b)      The statute of limitations has closed for all Tax
                           Returns of the Acquired Companies.

                  (d)      There are no liens for Taxes upon the material assets

                           Companies (other than Liens for Taxes that are not
                           yet due and payable).

                  (e)      None of the assets of the Acquired Companies are
                           considered tax-exempt use property or tax-exempt bond

                           168(g)(1)(B) or (C) of the Code.

                           effect an election under Section 936(a) of the Code
                           during the ten taxable years ending immediately prior
                           to the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.
                           Such election has not been revoked during such ten
                           year period.

                  (g)      All Tax Returns filed by To-Ricos with any Puerto
                           Rican Governmental Authority are true and correct in
                           all material respects.

                  (h)      To Seller's knowledge, none of the Acquired Companies
                           has a material taxable presence in any jurisdiction
                           where they do not file a Tax Return.

                  (i)      The Acquired Companies have not made or become
                           obligated to make, and will not as a result of the
                           transactions contemplated hereby become obligated to
                           make, any payments that could be nondeductible by
                           reason of Section 280G (without regard to subsection
                           (b)(4) thereof) or 162(m) of the Code, nor will any
                           Acquired Company be required to "gross up" or
                           otherwise compensate any individual because of the
                           imposition of any excise tax on such a payment to the
                           individual.

         7.11     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Acquired Companies own, or possess
                  adequate licenses or other rights to use (or will as of the
                  Closing Date own or possess adequate

                  Property Rights currently used or necessary to conduct the
                  Business as now operated by them. Without limitation to the
                  foregoing, the Acquired Companies own (or will as of the
                  Closing Date own) the trademarks and related Intellectual
                  Property Rights described in Section 7.11 of the Seller
                  Disclosure Schedule and those trademarks include the only
                  material trademarks used in the Business (other than the
                  Retained Intellectual Property). To the knowledge of Seller,
                  and other than such infringements that would not have a
                  Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Intellectual Property
                  Rights of the Acquired Companies currently used to conduct the
                  Business do not infringe upon any Intellectual Property Rights
                  of others, and (ii) no third party is infringing on the
                  Intellectual Property Rights of any of the Acquired Companies
                  currently used to conduct the Business. For purposes of this
                  Agreement, "Intellectual Property Right" means any trademark,
                  service mark, trade name, mask work, copyright, patent,
                  software license, data base, invention, trade secret, know-how
                  (including any registrations or applications for registration
                  of any of the foregoing) or any other similar type of
                  proprietary intellectual property right.

         7.12     ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS. As of the date hereof, there are no
                  outstanding orders, judgments, injunctions, awards or decrees
                  of any Governmental Authority against any of the Acquired
                  Companies other than those that would not have a Company
                  Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there are no
                  actions, suits or legal, administrative, regulatory or

                           would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the

                  Section 8.15, Buyer's employees, former employees, or their

                  include any government sponsored employee benefit
                  arrangements. Except as reflected in the Seller Disclosure
                  Schedule or as would not have, individually or in the
                  aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect:

                  7.17.1   The Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies all of the
                           Employee Plans.

                  7.17.2   The Seller, the Acquired Companies, each Employee
                           Plan, and the administrator and fiduciaries of each
                           Employee Plan have complied in all material respects
                           with all applicable legal requirements governing each
                           Employee Plan including, but not limited to, the
                           Code, ERISA, HIPAA and the changes made under the
                           Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. No lawsuits or complaints
                           to, or by, any Person are pending with respect to any
                           Employee Plan.

                  7.17.3   No Employee Plan is currently under audit,
                           examination or investigation by any government
                           agency, including but not limited to the IRS, the SEC
                           or the DOL.

                  7.17.4   To the best of Seller's knowledge, neither Seller,
                           its Affiliates, the Acquired Companies, an Employee
                           Plan, nor an administrator or fiduciary of any
                           Employee Plan has taken any action, or failed to take
                           any action, that could subject it or him or her or
                           any other Person to any liability for any excise tax,




                                      -56-

                           fine or other penalty under applicable laws or for
                           breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or the Code with
                           respect to or in connection with any Employee Plan.

                  7.17.5   Neither Seller, their Affiliates, the Acquired
                           Companies, an Employee Plan, an administrator or
                           fiduciary of any Employee Plan, nor any other Person
                           has any liability to any Employee Plan participant,
                           beneficiary or other Person under any provision of
                           ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law by reason
                           of any payment of benefits or other amounts or
                           failure to pay benefits or any other amounts, or by
                           reason of any credit or failure to give credit for
                           any benefits or rights (such as, but not limited to,
                           vesting rights) with respect to benefits under or in
                           connection with any Employee Plan. Neither Seller,
                           their Affiliates nor any of the Acquired Companies is
                           in arrears with respect to any contributions under or
                           premiums payable for any Employee Plan.

                  7.17.6   Each Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a)
                           of the Code, and the trust or trusts maintained in
                           connection with such Pension Plan is or are exempt
                           from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. A
                           favorable IRS determination letter as to the
                           qualification under the Code has been received for
                           each such Pension Plan and its related trust or
                           trusts and has been, or will be, timely amended for
                           the recent tax changes commonly referred to as
                           "GUST," since the date of such determination letter
                           there are no circumstances that are likely to
                           adversely affect the qualification of such Pension
                           Plans, and each such Pension Plan has been, or will
                           be, timely

                           Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.

                           time during the last six (6) years been a

                  Agreement.

         7.23     INVENTORY. Except for such matters that would not have a
                  Company Material Adverse Effect, to Seller's knowledge, the

                  which is slow-moving, obsolete, damaged, or defective, subject
                  only to applicable reserves. Since April 20, 2003, the

                  material respects at levels in the ordinary course of
                  business. The inventory of the Acquired Companies existing on

                  respectively, the Business' top 25 customers determined by

                  and (b) for the Acquired Companies' fiscal year ended May 25,
                  2003, by facility, the amount of revenue and type of product

                  to operations of Seller that do not constitute the Business
                  (including the Retained Business). Seller has previously
                  provided to Buyer a schedule of each of the Business'
                  long-term pricing commitments for the Major Customers for the
                  fiscal year ending May 30, 2004 in effect as of the date of
                  this Agreement, and no material reduction in any such
                  commitment has occurred between February 23, 2003 and the date
                  of this Agreement. Except as indicated in the Seller
                  Disclosure Schedule, none of the Business' top 25 customers,

                  Acquired Companies between February 23, 2003 and the date of
                  this Agreement, or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened to do so
                  or otherwise




                                      -68-

                  notified any Acquired Company of its intention to do so, and
                  there has been no material dispute with any of such customers
                  between February 23, 2003 and the date of this Agreement.

         7.25     NO OTHER BUSINESS. As of the Closing, the Acquired Companies
                  will not have (a) any material amount of assets or Liabilities
                  that do not primarily relate to the Business or (b) any
                  employees that have not historically spent substantially all
                  of their time performing services for the Business

                  citations against the Acquired Companies under any Law
                  designed to provide safe and healthful working conditions and
                  to reduce occupational safety and health hazards, or any
                  program, whether government or private, designed to provide
                  safe and healthful working conditions, including the
                  Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) (collectively, "OSHA
                  Laws") or state equivalent other than those that would not
                  have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof,
                  to Seller's knowledge, none of the Acquired Companies is in
                  violation of any OSHA Laws that could reasonably be expected
                  to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. This Section 7.26
                  contains the exclusive representations and warranties of
                  Seller with regard to OSHA Laws, and any violation thereof or
                  other matter related thereto, in this Agreement.

                  to Seller complete and correct copies of Buyer's Charter

                           rights and remedies generally and subject, as to
                           enforceability, to general principles of equity.

                           of Buyer Capital Stock.

                  (c)      Except as contemplated in Section 8.4(b), no other
                           corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer are
                           necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
                           Ancillary Agreements or to consummate the
                           transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

                  violation, conflict, default, right, loss, cancellation or
                  acceleration, or Encumbrance that, individually or in the

                  financial condition, results of operations or capitalization
                  of Buyer, or prevent the consummation of the transactions

         8.8      SUBSIDIARIES.

                  8.8.1    Buyer's Subsidiaries and their respective
                           jurisdictions of incorporation are identified on the
                           Buyer Disclosure Schedule. Each Subsidiary of Buyer
                           is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
                           in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
                           of incorporation, and each has the corporate power to
                           own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on
                           its business as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary
                           of Buyer is qualified to conduct its business in all
                           jurisdictions in which such qualification or
                           authorization is required, except for those
                           jurisdictions in which failure to be so qualified or
                           authorized would not have a Buyer Material Adverse
                           Effect.

                  8.8.2    Except as identified on the Buyer Disclosure
                           Schedule, all of the outstanding capital stock of, or
                           other ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of
                           Buyer, is owned by Buyer, free and clear of all
                           claims, options, charges and Encumbrances, and all of
                           the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
                           equity interests of each Subsidiary of Buyer are
                           validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

         8.9      CONDUCT OF BUSINESS SINCE MARCH 29, 2003. Since March 29, 2003
                  and except for transactions contemplated herein or set forth
                  on the Buyer Disclosure Schedule:

                  8.9.1    There has not been a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

                  8.9.2    No event has occurred that would have been prevented
                           by Section 9.2.1 if the terms of said Section had
                           been in effect as of and after March 29, 2003.

                  8.9.3    Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has
                           incurred or assumed any




                                      -74-

                           indebtedness for borrowed funds or purchase money
                           indebtedness, or assumed, guaranteed, endorsed or
                           otherwise become liable or responsible (either
                           directly, contingently or otherwise) for the
                           obligations of any other Person, except in respect of
                           such assumption, guarantees or endorsements for such
                           amounts that are incurred in the ordinary course of
                           Buyer's business.

         8.10     SEC DOCUMENTS AND OTHER REPORTS. Buyer has filed all documents
                  required to be filed by it and its Subsidiaries with the SEC
                  since September 28, 2000 (the "Buyer SEC Documents"). As of
                  their respective dates, or if amended as of the date of the
                  last such amendment, the Buyer SEC Documents complied, and all
                  documents required to be filed by Buyer with the SEC after the
                  date hereof and prior to the Effective Time ("Subsequent Buyer
                  SEC Documents") will comply, in all material respects with the
                  requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the
                  case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations
                  promulgated thereunder. The consolidated financial statements
                  (including related notes) of Buyer included in the Buyer SEC
                  Documents fairly present in all material respects, and the
                  consolidated financial statements (including related notes) of
                  Buyer included in the Subsequent Buyer SEC Documents will
                  fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated
                  financial position of Buyer and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
                  as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
                  results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
                  for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of
                  the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments
                  and to any other adjustments described therein and the fact
                  that certain information and notes have been condensed or
                  omitted in accordance with the Exchange Act and the rules and





                                      -75-

                  regulations promulgated thereunder) in conformity with GAAP
                  (except in the case of the unaudited statements) applied on a
                  consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
                  indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since September
                  28, 2002, Buyer has not made any change in the accounting
                  practices or policies applied in the preparation of its
                  financial statements, except as may be required by GAAP or
                  disclosed in the Buyer SEC Documents. Except for such matters
                  that would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
                  receivables of Buyer, as reflected on the latest financial
                  statements included in the Buyer SEC Documents or created
                  subsequent to the date of such financial statements were
                  created in the ordinary course of Buyer's business, (ii) to
                  the knowledge of Buyer and subject to any reserves established
                  therefor in such financial statements, will be collected in
                  accordance with their terms and at their recorded amounts, in
                  accordance with Buyer's prior practices, and (iii) between the
                  date of such financial statements and the date hereof, to the
                  knowledge of Buyer, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
                  has (a) permitted or agreed to any extension in the time for
                  payment of receivables relating to its business other than in
                  the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
                  practice or (b) changed its policies or practices with respect
                  to the extension of credit to customers of Buyer other than in
                  the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
                  practice.

         8.11     ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS. There are no outstanding orders,
                  judgments, injunctions, awards or decrees of any Governmental
                  Authority against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries other than
                  those that would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.
                  Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents filed prior to the
                  date hereof, there are no




                                      -76-

                  actions, suits or legal, administrative, regulatory or
                  arbitration proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer,
                  threatened against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that, if
                  adversely determined, would result, individually or in the
                  aggregate, in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Neither Buyer
                  nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any property or asset of Buyer
                  or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to (other than as apply
                  to the poultry industry in general) or in violation of any
                  order, executive order, writ, stay, decree, judgment,
                  determination, award or injunction that could reasonably be
                  expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

         8.12     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except for such matters that would not
                  have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (i) Buyer holds, owns or
                  possesses, and is in compliance with the terms of, all
                  permits, licenses, exemptions, orders and approvals of all
                  Governmental Authorities (other than Environmental Permits,
                  which are exclusively provided for in Section 8.16) necessary
                  for the conduct of its businesses and to own, lease and
                  operate its properties (the "Buyer Permits"), (ii) with
                  respect to the Buyer Permits, no action or proceeding is
                  pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened by any
                  Governmental Authority, (iii) Buyer's business is being
                  conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws, and (iv) no
                  investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with
                  respect to Buyer is pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer,
                  threatened, in each case, other than disclosed on the Buyer
                  Disclosure Schedule.

                  as of the date hereof, a listing of all of the following

                  its Subsidiaries nor, to Buyer's knowledge, any other party to
                  any such Buyer Material Contract is in breach thereof, or
                  default thereunder, and (iii) there does not exist under any
                  provision thereof, or any event that, with the giving of
                  notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
                  breach or default except for such breaches, defaults and
                  events which in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) would
                  not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material
                  Adverse Effect. Buyer has made available to Seller true and
                  correct copies of all Buyer Material Contracts.

                           arbitration proceedings, letter agreements or
                           settlement agreements arising out of collective

                           no activity involving any employees seeking to

                           knowledge, as of the date hereof, except as described
                           in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, no executive, key
                           employee, or group of employees has any plans to
                           terminate employment with Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

         8.15     EMPLOYEE PLANS. Except as reflected in the Buyer Disclosure
                  Schedule or as would not have, individually or in the
                  aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect:

                  8.15.1   The Buyer Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Employee

                  8.15.2   Buyer, each Employee Plan, and the administrator and
                           fiduciaries of each Employee Plan have complied in
                           all material respects with all applicable legal
                           requirements governing each Employee Plan, including,
                           but not limited to, the Code, ERISA, HIPAA and the
                           changes made under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. No
                           lawsuits or complaints to, or by, any Person are
                           pending with respect to any Employee Plan.

                  8.15.3   No Employee Plan is currently under audit,
                           examination or investigation by any government
                           agency, including but not limited to the IRS, the SEC
                           or the DOL.

                  8.15.4   To the best of Buyer's knowledge, neither Buyer, its
                           Affiliates, an Employee Plan, nor an administrator or
                           fiduciary of any Employee Plan has taken any action,
                           or failed to take any action, that could subject it
                           or him or her or any other Person to any liability
                           for any excise tax, fine or other penalty under

                           applicable laws or for breach of fiduciary duty under
                           ERISA or the Code with respect to or in connection
                           with any Employee Plan.

                  8.15.5   Neither Buyer, its Affiliates, an Employee Plan, an
                           administrator or fiduciary of any Employee Plan, nor
                           any other Person has any liability to any Employee
                           Plan participant, beneficiary or other Person under
                           any provision of ERISA, the Code or any other
                           applicable law by reason of any payment of benefits
                           or other amounts or failure to pay benefits or any
                           other amounts, or by reason of any credit or failure
                           to give credit for any benefits or rights (such as,
                           but not limited to, vesting rights) with respect to
                           benefits under or in connection with an Employee
                           Plan. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates is in arrears
                           with respect to any contributions under or premiums
                           payable for any Employee Plan.

                  8.15.6   Each funded Employee Plan that is a Pension Plan is
                           qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and the
                           trust or trusts maintained in connection with such
                           Employee Plan is or are exempt from tax under Section
                           501(a) of the Code. A favorable IRS determination
                           letter as to the qualification under the Code has
                           been received for each such Pension Plan. A favorable
                           IRS determination letter as to the qualification
                           under the Code has been received for each such
                           Pension Plan and its related trust or trusts and has
                           been or will be timely amended for the recent tax
                           changes commonly referred to as "GUST", since the
                           date of such determination letter there are not
                           circumstances that are likely to adversely affect the
                           qualification of such Pension Plans, and each such
                           Pension Plan has been

                           Multiemployer Plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of
                           ERISA).

                  8.15.8   No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of
                           ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Buyer
                           of its Affiliates either directly or indirectly with
                           respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single
                           employer plan", within the meaning of Section
                           4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

                           governmental or administrative agency, with respect
                           to pension benefits, unemployment compensation
                           benefits, social security benefits or any other

                           have been paid or adequate accruals therefore have
                           been made in Buyer's financial statements, and none
                           of the foregoing has been rendered not due by reason
                           of any extension, whether at the request of any of
                           Buyer, its Affiliates or otherwise.

                  8.15.10  Buyer and its Affiliates are in material compliance
                           with the requirements of Sections 162(k) (to the
                           extent applicable prior to its amendment by the

                           4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA and no
                           event or condition exists with respect to any welfare
                           plan that could subject Buyer or its Affiliates to
                           any tax under the foregoing sections of the Code and
                           ERISA.

                           terminate any such post-retirement medical or other
                           benefits upon thirty (30) days' notice or less

                  Property Rights currently used or necessary to conduct its
                  business. Without limitation to the foregoing, Buyer owns the

                  trademarks are the only material trademarks used in the
                  business of Buyer. To the knowledge of Buyer, and other than

                  Adverse Effect, (i) the Intellectual Property Rights of the

                  is in violation of any OSHA Laws that could reasonably be
                  expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. This Section
                  8.25 contains the exclusive representations and warranties of
                  Buyer with regard to OSHA Laws, and any violation thereof or
                  other matter related thereto, in this Agreement.

                           paid or accrued. No Governmental Authority has
                           asserted any material claim for Taxes, or to the
                           Buyer's knowledge, has threatened to assert any

                           become obligated to make, and will not as a result of
                           the transactions contemplated hereby become obligated
                           to make, any payments that could be nondeductible by

                           (b)(4) thereof) or 162(m) of the Code, nor will any
                           of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries be required to
                           "gross up" or otherwise compensate any individual
                           because of the imposition of any excise tax on such a
                           payment to the individual.

                  (h)      To Buyer's knowledge, no facts or circumstances have
                           occurred or failed to occur which would cause the
                           inclusion of the suspense account (that Buyer
                           established pursuant to Code Section 447(i)(1)) into
                           the gross income of the Buyer or any member of its
                           affiliated group other than ratably as provided by
                           Code Section 447(i)(5), consistent with Buyer's past
                           practice. In addition, the transactions contemplated
                           in this Agreement will not cause the Buyer or its
                           affiliated group to include the balance of such
                           suspense account into gross income for Tax purposes.

                           foregoing, unless Seller shall otherwise agree in
                           writing (which agreement shall not be unreasonably
                           withheld) or as contemplated by this Agreement or as
                           necessary or appropriate to satisfy its obligations

                           other authorized representatives (except to the
                           extent not permitted under Law or to the extent
                           resulting in the waiver of attorney-client privilege,
                           as advised by counsel), with reasonable access during
                           normal business hours to Buyer's and its

                           and personnel.

                  9.2.3    CONTRACTS. Buyer acknowledges that various contracts
                           relating to the Business were originally entered into
                           in the name of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
                           (other than the Acquired Companies). Such contracts
                           have been or, subject to Section 9.12, will be
                           assigned to CPC at or prior to Closing. Buyer shall
                           indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless
                           from and against all Liability arising under such
                           contracts, except to the extent Buyer is entitled to
                           indemnification with respect to such Liability
                           pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof. Buyer and Buyer's
                           Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts
                           to obtain the release of Seller and its Affiliates
                           (other than the Acquired Companies) from all
                           Liabilities arising under such contracts. Buyer
                           shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, not
                           renew or otherwise extend, or permit the renewal or
                           extension of, the existing term of any such contracts
                           to the extent Buyer has or gains knowledge of such
                           contracts, other than any such contract with respect
                           to which Seller and its

                           have no potential Liability.

                  9.2.4    GUARANTEES. Buyer and Seller shall use their
                           commercially reasonable efforts to cause Buyer to be
                           substituted in all respects for Seller and its
                           Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), and
                           Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
                           Companies) fully released, effective as of the
                           Closing or as soon as possible thereafter, in respect
                           of all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates
                           (other than the Acquired Companies) under each of the
                           guarantees, indemnities, bonding arrangements,
                           letters of credit and letters of comfort given by
                           Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
                           Companies) for the benefit of the Business (the
                           "Guarantees"), including, without limitation, those
                           which are identified on Exhibit 9.2.4 hereto. If any
                           such release cannot be obtained, (i) Buyer shall
                           indemnify and hold Seller and Seller's Affiliates
                           (other than the Acquired Companies) harmless from and
                           against any Liability relating to any Guarantee not
                           released except to the extent Buyer is entitled to
                           indemnification with respect to such Liability
                           pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof, and (ii) Buyer
                           shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, not
                           renew or otherwise extend the original term of any
                           contract, agreement, lease, or other document or
                           instrument to which such unreleased Guarantee relates
                           to the extent Buyer has or gains knowledge of such
                           unreleased Guarantee.

                           the date hereof until the Closing Date, Buyer shall

                           condition, fact or circumstance that would make the
                           timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set
                           forth in Section 10 impossible or

                           unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be
                           expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.
                           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
                           Buyer shall promptly advise Seller in writing of any
                           Action threatened, commenced or asserted against or
                           with respect to Buyer, except where such Action would
                           not be reasonably likely to have a Buyer Material
                           Adverse Effect. No notification given to Seller
                           pursuant to this Section 9.2.6 shall limit or
                           otherwise affect any of the representations,
                           warranties, covenants or obligations of Buyer

                           Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

         9.3      NO SOLICITATION. From the date hereof through the date two (2)
                  years after the earlier of the Closing Date and the
                  termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11, neither
                  Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one
                  hand, nor Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on
                  the other, will, directly or indirectly, except as
                  contemplated by this Agreement, solicit for employment or
                  employ any management level employee of the other party;
                  provided, however, nothing herein shall restrict the above
                  referenced parties from (i) soliciting any such employee by
                  general employment advertising or third party employment
                  agencies (so long as such agencies are not directed by such
                  parties to target such employees), or (ii) hiring any employee
                  who responds to such permitted solicitation or seeks
                  employment on an unsolicited basis. The parties hereto agree
                  that the terms of this Section 9.3 shall

         9.4      EXCLUDED ASSETS.

                  9.4.1    RETAINED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Seller specifically
                           and exclusively retains all right, title and interest
                           in and to the name "ConAgra," "Butterball," "Country

                           names, copyrights and trade dress related thereto
                           (the "Retained Intellectual Property"). Buyer
                           acknowledges that, except as provided in the
                           Transition Trademark License Agreement, it will not
                           acquire, and that the Acquired Companies do not own,
                           any right, title or interest in or to the Retained
                           Intellectual Property. Buyer agrees that as promptly
                           as practicable after Closing, except as required by
                           any agreement to which an Acquired Company was bound
                           immediately prior to Closing, it will cause the
                           Acquired Companies to discontinue the use of any
                           advertising or other form of media that uses or
                           references any such Retained Intellectual Property,
                           except as permitted by the Transition Trademark
                           License Agreement. Buyer further agrees that as soon
                           as practicable, but in no event longer than one (1)
                           year after the Closing Date, it shall remove all
                           signage which refers to any Retained Intellectual
                           Property, and take all such other action as may be
                           necessary to dissociate Seller with the operations of
                           the Business after Closing, except as permitted by
                           the Transition Trademark License Agreement.

                           that the Acquired Companies are covered by certain

                           conduct of the Business on or prior to the Closing
                           Date for which Seller would be entitled to assert, or

                           use its reasonable efforts to assert, or to assist

                           under such insurance covering such loss, Liability or
                           damage if none of the Acquired Companies are entitled
                           to assert such claim, but Seller or an Affiliate
                           thereof is so entitled, in all events subject to
                           applicable deductibles and retentions, (y) Seller
                           shall provide the Acquired Companies with any

                           subject to applicable deductibles and retentions, and
                           (z) Seller shall provide the Acquired Companies with
                           access to any applicable insurance policies. Buyer
                           further acknowledges that the systems and services
                           listed on Exhibit 9.4.2 hereto (the "Corporate
                           Services") are supplied by Seller or its Affiliates
                           to the Business, and (ii) Buyer will not acquire, and
                           the Acquired Companies do not own, any right, title

                  9.4.3    RETAINED ASSETS. The Retained Assets shall be
                           distributed by the Acquired Companies to Seller or

         9.5      RECORD RETENTION. Except as set forth below and also subject
                  to Section 13 hereof, Buyer will cause all books and records
                  relating to the Business as of the Closing (the "Records") to
                  be retained for seven (7) years after Closing. In addition,
                  except as set forth below and also subject to Section 13
                  hereof, to the extent any books and records relating to the
                  Business are retained by Seller following Closing (the
                  "Retained Records"), Seller shall retain the Retained Records
                  for seven (7) years after Closing. During such term, each
                  party shall allow the other party and its representatives
                  access to inspect or copy the Records and Retained Records, as
                  appropriate, during normal business hours. In the event a
                  party intends to destroy any Records or Retained Records in
                  its control at the end of such seven (7) year term, such party
                  shall first notify the other party at which time the other
                  party shall have the right to remove the Records at its own
                  cost. The parties acknowledge that, in the past, they have
                  routinely disposed of certain books and records on a periodic
                  basis and have not retained such books and records for seven
                  (7) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may
                  continue such routine periodic record destruction so long as
                  prior to such destruction, the party intending to destroy the
                  records notifies the other party of the nature of such
                  destruction and permits the other party to remove and retain
                  such records at its expense.

         9.6      GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.

                  9.6.1    Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided
                           and applicable legal requirements, each of the
                           parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
                           reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
                           action, and to do, or

                           the other parties hereto in doing, as promptly as
                           practicable, all things necessary, proper or
                           advisable under applicable Laws to ensure that the
                           conditions set forth in Section 10 are satisfied and

                  9.6.2    Each of the parties shall use its commercially
                           reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as
                           practicable all consents, waivers, approvals,
                           authorizations or permits of, or registration or
                           filing with or notification to, any Governmental
                           Authority or any other Person required in connection
                           with, and waivers of any violations, defaults or
                           breaches that may be caused by, such party's
                           consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
                           Agreement.

                  9.6.3    Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of
                           any communication from the FTC, the DOJ, the SEC or
                           any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the
                           transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any
                           party hereto or any Affiliate thereof receives a
                           request for additional information or documentary
                           material from any such Governmental Authority with
                           respect to the transactions contemplated by this
                           Agreement, then such party shall use commercially
                           reasonable efforts to cause to be made, as soon as
                           reasonably practicable and after consultation with
                           the other party, an appropriate response in
                           compliance with such request.

                  9.6.4    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
                           each of the parties will

                           information or documentation. Buyer shall pay all of
                           its filing and its legal fees associated with the

                  (a)      Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
                           hand, each acknowledge and agree that it has made its
                           own inquiry and investigation into, and, based
                           thereon, has formed an independent judgment
                           concerning, the other party and its Subsidiaries and
                           their business and operations, and such party has
                           requested such documents and information from the

                           Agreement. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
                           other hand, each acknowledges and agrees that it has
                           had an opportunity to ask all questions of and
                           receive answers from the other party with respect to

                           contemplated in this Agreement. In connection with
                           each party's investigation of the other party and its
                           Subsidiaries and their business and operations, each
                           party and its representatives have received from the
                           other party or its representatives certain

                           budget information. Each party acknowledges and
                           agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in

                           estimates, plans and budgets; that such party is
                           familiar with such uncertainties; that such party is
                           taking full responsibility for making its own

         9.8      LITIGATION.

                  9.8.1    COMPANY LITIGATION. Buyer acknowledges that various
                           Actions are now pending or may arise after the date
                           hereof which result from operations of the Business
                           or Acquired Companies and which name, or may in the
                           future name, Seller (and/or one or more of Seller's
                           Affiliates), either individually, together with one
                           or more Acquired Companies, or otherwise, as a party
                           thereto, including, without limitation, the Actions
                           which are described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule
                           (the "Company Litigation"); provided, however, that
                           for purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company
                           Litigation" shall not include the Retained
                           Litigation. Except as to matters subject to Seller's
                           indemnification obligations under Section 12.1, Buyer
                           shall indemnify and hold Seller and Seller's
                           Affiliates harmless from and against all Liability
                           relating to the Company Litigation including, without
                           limitation, all costs and expenses of defending the
                           Company Litigation. Buyer may settle or compromise
                           any such Company Litigation (i) with the written
                           consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
                           unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (ii) without
                           such consent, so long as such settlement or
                           compromise includes (A) an unconditional release of
                           Seller and/or its Affiliates, as the case may be,
                           from all Liability in respect of such Company
                           Litigation, (B) does not subject Seller or its
                           Affiliates to any injunctive relief or other
                           equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a



                                     -112-

                           statement or omission of fault, culpability or
                           failure to act by or on behalf of Seller or its
                           Affiliates. Seller and its Affiliates shall have the
                           right, but not the obligation, to participate at
                           their own expense in the defense of any Company
                           Litigation and any such participation shall not in
                           any way diminish or lessen the obligations of Buyer
                           hereunder. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
                           Buyer, at Buyer's cost and expense, in connection
                           with the defense of any Company Litigation and, in
                           connection therewith, shall furnish on a timely basis
                           all such information, records, documents and
                           testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
                           proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
                           reasonably requested by Buyer, and provide, on a
                           timely basis, access to and availability of its
                           employees for purposes of such litigation, including,
                           without limitation, for purposes of assisting in
                           trial preparation and the conduct of any trial.

                  9.8.2    RETAINED LITIGATION. Notwithstanding anything
                           contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
                           parties hereto agree that Seller, at its cost and
                           expense, shall retain, and shall have the sole right
                           to control, all claims and causes of action which
                           have been asserted or may be asserted in the future
                           by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies in the
                           following captioned lawsuits and/or any other
                           lawsuits which may be filed in the future with
                           respect to the subject matter of such captioned
                           lawsuits (hereinafter collectively referred to as the
                           "Retained Litigation"):

                                    appeals thereof.

                           Seller shall be entitled to receive and retain the
                           benefits of any judgment awarded or settlement
                           reached in connection with the Retained Litigation.
                           Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
                           to, reasonably cooperate with Seller, at Seller's
                           cost and expense, in respect to the Retained
                           Litigation and, in connection therewith shall

                           Company Employees for purposes of such litigation,
                           including, without limitation, for purposes of
                           assisting in trial preparation and the conduct of any
                           trial. Seller may settle or compromise the Retained
                           Litigation (i) with the written consent of Buyer,
                           which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
                           delayed, or (ii) without such consent, so long as
                           such settlement or compromise includes (a) an
                           unconditional release of the Acquired Companies from

                  financial statements referred to in Section 9.15, file with

                  use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy
                  Statement cleared by the SEC as soon as practicable. Seller
                  shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of the Proxy
                  Statement, including providing Buyer with such information
                  relating to Seller and its Affiliates and the Business as may

                  discovered by a party which should be set forth in an
                  amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party
                  shall promptly inform the other party and the parties shall
                  cooperate in taking appropriate action in respect thereof.

                           stockholders of Buyer the issuance of the Shares and
                           include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation.

                  (b)      Buyer, as promptly as practicable, shall cause the
                           definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
                           stockholders as soon as practicable following the
                           date on which it is cleared by the SEC.

         9.11     BATESVILLE PROPERTY. Seller shall, following the date hereof,
                  take all necessary action to "split" or otherwise "subdivide"
                  the real estate relating to Seller's and CPC's Batesville,
                  Arkansas facilities (the "Shared Property") along the lines as

                  included with the Business and, prior to the Closing Date,
                  shall be conveyed by Seller to CPC. Buyer and Seller shall use
                  their mutual best efforts to identify and resolve on or prior
                  to the Closing Date, or as soon as possible thereafter, all
                  issues relating to the Shared Property to provide for the
                  independent use and enjoyment of Parcel X by Seller and
                  Parcels Y and Z by CPC, such that such properties can be
                  independently operated after Closing on substantially the same
                  basis as such properties were operated prior to such split or
                  subdivision, including, without limitation, executing and
                  delivering cross-use and/or cross-easement agreements

         9.12     UNASSIGNABLE CONTRACTS. If (i) any third-party's (including
                  any Governmental Authority's) consent or approval to the
                  assignment or other transfer to the applicable Acquired
                  Company of a contract to be transferred pursuant to a
                  provision of this Agreement has not been obtained prior to the
                  Closing, then as to the burdens, obligations, rights or
                  benefits under or pursuant to such contracts (collectively,
                  the "Rights") not assignable to the applicable Acquired
                  Company because such consent or approval has not been
                  obtained:

                  (a)      Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
                           hold the Rights in trust for the applicable Acquired
                           Company, for the account and benefit of the
                           applicable Acquired Company;

                  (b)      After the Closing, (i) Seller shall, and shall cause
                           its Affiliates other than the applicable Acquired
                           Company, to take such reasonable actions and do all
                           such things as shall be reasonably necessary or
                           desirable in order that the value of the Rights shall
                           be preserved and shall inure to the benefit of the
                           applicable Acquired Company and such that all
                           benefits under the Rights may be received by the
                           applicable Acquired Company, and (ii) Buyer shall
                           cause the applicable Acquired Company to perform the
                           burdens and obligations under such Rights; and

                  (c)      After the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall continue to
                           use their respective reasonable efforts to obtain
                           such consent or approval.

                  (5) years after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of
                  its Subsidiaries will, within North America or Central America
                  (including Puerto Rico and the Caribbean region), without the
                  prior written consent of Buyer, (A) directly or indirectly
                  engage in (i) the growing or slaughtering of chickens, (ii) an
                  integrated chicken operation that grows, slaughters and
                  processes chickens, (iii) the sale of fresh chicken, or (iv)
                  the sale of fresh frozen chicken (whole or parts) that has not
                  been further processed (collectively, the "Restricted
                  Activities") (other than through their ownership of Shares or
                  other ownership interests in Buyer and other than as a holder
                  of less than 2% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly
                  traded corporation), or (B) (i) use, license or otherwise
                  allow any third party to use (to the extent Seller has rights
                  to limit such use) the name "Butterball," or use or license
                  any third party to use the name "Country Skillet," or in
                  either case any derivation thereof, as a trademark, service
                  mark, trade name or domain name in connection with any
                  Restricted Activity, or (ii) use, license or convey any rights
                  to a third party to any trade dress or copyright associated
                  with products marketed under such name or mark in connection
                  with any Restricted Activity. If Seller fails to keep or
                  perform every covenant of this Section 9.13, Buyer shall be
                  entitled to specifically enforce the same by injunction in
                  equity in addition to any other remedies which Buyer may have.
                  If any portion of this Section 9.13 shall be invalid or
                  unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall in no
                  way be deemed or construed to affect in any way the
                  enforceability of any other provision of this Section 9.13. If
                  any court in which Buyer seeks to have the provisions of this
                  Section 9.13 enforced determines that the activities, time or
                  geographic area




                                     -118-
<PAGE>

                  hereinabove specified are too broad, such court may determine
                  a reasonable activity, time or geographic area and shall
                  enforce this Section 9.13 for such activity, time and
                  geographic area.

         9.14     TRANSFERS OF BUSINESS ASSETS. Seller shall cause its assets
                  and Liabilities to be transferred and assigned so that the
                  representations and warranties contained in Sections 7.19 and
                  7.25 are true and correct in all material respects as of the
                  Closing.

         9.15     AUDIT. Seller shall cause combined, consolidated financial
                  statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X and
                  otherwise in a form that meets the requirement of Schedule 14A
                  under the Exchange Act for, with respect to the balance sheets
                  required thereby, the two (2) consecutive fiscal years ending
                  May 25, 2003 and, with respect to the related statements of
                  earnings and cash flows required thereby, the three (3)
                  consecutive fiscal years ending May 25, 2003, to be prepared
                  for the Business and audited by Deloitte as promptly as
                  practicable. Buyer shall be able to review such draft
                  combined, consolidated financial statement for the Business,
                  and the related workpapers, prior to issuance to ensure that
                  they are appropriate for inclusion in its proxy statement to
                  be filed with the SEC. At the request of Buyer, Seller shall
                  use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Deloitte to
                  consent to the inclusion of their related audit report in
                  Buyer's future SEC filings.

         9.16     COVENANT NOT TO DISCLOSE. Seller agrees that as the owner of
                  the Business, it and its Affiliates may possess certain data
                  and knowledge of operations of the Business which may be
                  proprietary in nature and confidential, including certain



                                     -119-
<PAGE>

                  trade secrets (herein, "Business Confidential Information").
                  Seller covenants and agrees that neither it nor any of its
                  Affiliates will, at any time after the Closing, reveal,
                  divulge or make known to any Person (other than Buyer) or use
                  for its own account or for the account of any Person, any
                  Business Confidential Information. Seller further covenants
                  and agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall
                  divulge any such Business Confidential Information which it
                  may acquire during any transition period in which it assists
                  or consults with Buyer or its Affiliates to facilitate the
                  transfer and the continued success of the Business.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that the
                  foregoing provisions shall apply only to Business Confidential
                  Information which relates exclusively to the Business and not
                  to information which is otherwise used in connection with
                  Seller's other operations. In addition, notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, it shall not be a violation of the covenant set
                  forth in this Section 9.16 for Seller to disclose information
                  if required to do so by court order or if any information
                  disclosed by Seller is in the public domain other than as a
                  result of conduct by Seller or its Affiliates which
                  constitutes the breach of a confidentiality obligation to
                  Buyer.

         9.17     STANDSTILL. During the period from the date hereof until the
                  earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this
                  Agreement pursuant to Section 11, Seller agrees not to, and
                  will not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or
                  indirectly (a) trade in the Buyer's securities in violation of
                  applicable securities laws, (b) offer, pledge, sell, contract
                  to sell, grant or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of the
                  Buyer Capital Stock or any securities convertible into or
                  exercisable or exchangeable for Buyer Capital Stock or (c)
                  enter into any swap, short position or other




                                     -120-
<PAGE>

                  arrangement that transfers all or a portion of the economic
                  consequences associated with the ownership of any Buyer
                  Capital Stock (regardless of whether any of the transactions
                  described in clause (b) or (c) is to be settled by the
                  delivery of Buyer Capital Stock, or such other securities, in
                  cash or otherwise).

         9.18     EXPIRED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Section 9.18 of the
                  Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a list of expired, lapsed
                  and/or abandoned trademarks and patents ("Expired Intellectual
                  Property Rights") in which Seller or the Acquired Companies
                  may or may not hold some residual rights. Notwithstanding
                  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer agrees that,
                  effective as of the Effective Time, the Expired Intellectual
                  Property Rights shall be deemed conveyed to Buyer on an "as
                  is" basis without any representations and warranties
                  whatsoever except that, to the knowledge of Seller, none of
                  Seller or its Affiliates have sold, licensed or otherwise
                  assigned any such Expired Intellectual Property Rights.
                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees
                  that the representations and warranties set forth in Section
                  7.11 shall not apply to the Expired Intellectual Property
                  Rights and that Seller hereby disclaims all other warranties
                  and representations relating to the Expired Intellectual
                  Property Rights, including but not limited to, warranties of
                  title, validity, enforceability, revival rights and
                  non-infringement.

         9.19     CUBAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything
                  in this Agreement to the contrary, no right, title or interest
                  in or to any Intellectual Property Rights in Cuba shall be
                  assigned, transferred or licensed from Seller to Buyer unless
                  and until the parties have complied with all applicable laws
                  and




                                     -121-

                  regulations, including the receipt of any necessary approval,
                  consent or license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control
                  of the United States Department of the Treasury.

         9.20     LIABILITIES AND INVESTMENTS. Except as disclosed on Exhibit
                  9.20, Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies not to be
                  obligated under any Indebtedness or hold any Restricted
                  Investments (as those terms are defined in the subordinated
                  indenture related to the Subordinated Promissory Note)
                  immediately prior to the Closing.

         9.21     RIGHTS AS HOLDER OF SHARES. As long as Seller holds any Shares
                  issued pursuant to this Agreement, the rights and privileges
                  of Buyer's Class A common stock and Class B common stock
                  (including dividend rights) will be identical, except as
                  otherwise set forth in subparts (1) through (6) under the
                  heading "Common Stock" of Article Fourth of Buyer's
                  Certificate of Incorporation in effect as of the Closing Date.

                           periods imposed by, any Governmental Authority, which
                           the failure to obtain, make or occur would have the
                           effect of making any of the transactions contemplated
                           hereby illegal, shall have been obtained, shall have
                           been made or shall have occurred.

                           preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and
                           has the effect of making the transactions
                           contemplated herein illegal or otherwise prohibiting

                           Date, except for such inaccuracies (without giving
                           effect to any limitations as to materiality or a

                           Adverse Effect. Buyer shall have received an

                           be materially different from the results of

                           Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
                           preventing the consummation of the transactions

                           available with respect to breaches of representation

                           obtain such stockholder approval is attributable to a
                           failure on the part of such party to perform any
                           material obligation required to be performed by such

         11.2     EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
                  Agreement pursuant to this Section 11, the transactions
                  contemplated hereby shall be deemed abandoned and this

                  Section 14.3 and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
                  shall survive any termination of this Agreement; provided,
                  however, that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any

                  reason other than pursuant to Sections 11.1(a) (b), (c), (d)
                  or (h) then Buyer shall immediately pay Seller $25,000,000.
                  Such payments shall be in addition to any other remedies or
                  damages available to the non-breaching party resulting from or
                  arising in connection with the other party's breach of this

                           understanding alleged to have been made by any such
                           Person with Seller or any of its Affiliates in
                           connection with the transactions contemplated by this
                           Agreement; and

                           assessments, adjustments, costs and expenses incident
                           to the foregoing or the Seller Indemnities and
                           including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
                           fees and other out-of-pocket expenses.

         12.2     INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLER BY BUYER. In addition to the other
                  indemnification obligations of Buyer set forth in this
                  Agreement (the "Buyer Indemnities"), from and after the
                  Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller, and the
                  directors, officers, employees and Affiliates of Seller,
                  harmless against and in respect of:

                  12.2.1   Any liability, loss, claim, damage or deficiency
                           resulting from any breach of representation or
                           warranty (without regard to any materiality or Buyer
                           Material Adverse Effect qualifier(s) contained in
                           such representations and warranties) or
                           nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the
                           part of Buyer under this Agreement, or from any
                           misrepresentation in or omission from any certificate
                           or other instrument furnished or to be furnished to
                           Seller hereunder;

                  12.2.2   Any liability, loss, claim, damage or deficiency
                           incurred or suffered by Seller or its Affiliates that
                           relate to the failure of Buyer or the Acquired
                           Companies to pay, perform or discharge any of the
                           Liabilities of the Acquired Companies, except as to
                           matters subject to Seller's indemnification
                           obligations under Section 12.1 or under any of
                           Seller's other

                           indemnity obligation under this Agreement or the
                           Ancillary Agreements;

                  12.2.3   All other actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
                           assessments, adjustments, costs and expenses incident
                           to the foregoing or the Buyer Indemnities and
                           including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
                           fees and other out-of-pocket expenses.

         12.3     THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. All claims for indemnification relating to
                  third party claims shall be asserted and resolved as set forth
                  in this section 12.3 subject, however, to the terms,
                  conditions and limitations otherwise set forth in this
                  Agreement. In the event that any written claim or demand for
                  which an Indemnifying Party would be liable is asserted
                  against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party
                  by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but
                  in no event more than 30 days following such Indemnified
                  Party's receipt of such claim or demand, notify the
                  Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim or demand and the
                  amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
                  feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
                  amount of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice"). The
                  Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed by any failure to
                  provide timely notice of the existence of a third party claim
                  or demand to the Indemnifying Party except to the extent that
                  the Indemnifying Party incurs any out-of-pocket expense as a
                  result of such delay or otherwise has been prejudiced as a
                  result of such delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have
                  fifteen days from the receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice
                  Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (a) whether or not
                  the Indemnifying Party disputes the liability of the
                  Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party hereunder with
                  respect to such claim or demand, and (b) whether or not it
                  desires to




                                     -133-
<PAGE>

                  defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. All
                  costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
                  defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and
                  shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party. In the event that
                  the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within
                  the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified
                  Party against such claim or demand and except as hereinafter
                  provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
                  select legal counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
                  Party, to represent and defend the Indemnified Party and to
                  otherwise control the proceedings relating to such claim or
                  demand. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all
                  reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its
                  counsel in defending any claims or demands, including, without
                  limitation, making available to the Indemnifying Party all
                  information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party
                  relating to such claim or demand, and shall not take any
                  action which is reasonably likely to be detrimental to such
                  defense. In addition, the Indemnified Party and the
                  Indemnifying Party shall render to each other such assistance
                  as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper
                  and adequate defense of any such claim or demand. The party in
                  charge of the defense shall keep the other party fully
                  apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any
                  settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If any
                  Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control,
                  any such defense or settlement it may do so at its sole cost
                  and expense provided, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
                  attorneys' fees of the Indemnified Party if (i) the employment
                  of separate counsel shall have been authorized in writing by
                  any such Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of
                  such third party claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party



                                     -134-
<PAGE>


                  shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
                  Indemnified Party to have charge of such third party claim, or
                  (iii) the Indemnified Party's counsel shall have advised the
                  Indemnified Party in writing with a copy to the Indemnifying
                  Party that there is conflict of interest that could make it
                  inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
                  conduct to have common counsel. In the event that the
                  Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend the claim, the
                  Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim or demand without
                  the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
                  unreasonably be withheld). The Indemnifying Party shall not,
                  without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
                  consent to the entry of a judgment, settle, compromise or
                  offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand or
                  admit or acknowledge any liability (i) on a basis which would
                  result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction,
                  decree or equitable remedy which would restrict the future
                  activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any Subsidiary
                  or Affiliate thereof without the written consent of the
                  Indemnified Party and (ii) without obtaining (a) a release of
                  the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim or demand and
                  (b) the dismissal with prejudice of any litigation or other
                  proceeding with respect to such claim or demand, in each case
                  for the benefit of and in form and substance reasonably
                  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
                  Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a
                  claim or demand for which the Indemnifying Party would be
                  liable, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely
                  notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any
                  such claim or demand, or, if the same is to be contested by
                  the Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof as to which
                  such




                                     -135-
<PAGE>

                  defense is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses
                  pertaining to such defense) shall be the liability of the
                  Indemnifying Party hereunder. To the extent the Indemnifying
                  Party shall control or participate in the defense or
                  settlement of any third party claim or demand, the Indemnified
                  Party will give to the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
                  access to, during normal business hours, the relevant business
                  records and other documents, and shall permit them to consult
                  with the employees and counsel of the Indemnified Party. The
                  Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
                  the defense of all such claims and demands.

         12.4     DIRECT CLAIMS. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
                  indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 12.3
                  because no third party action is involved, the Indemnified
                  Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
                  of any liability, loss, claim, damage or deficiency which such
                  Indemnified Party claims are subject to indemnification under
                  the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the terms, conditions
                  and limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnified
                  Party shall not be foreclosed by any failure to provide timely
                  notice of existence of a claim to the Indemnifying Party
                  except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party incurs any
                  out-of-pocket expense or otherwise has been prejudiced as a
                  result of such delay.

         12.5     LIMITATIONS.

                  12.5.1   BASKET. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any
                           Liability for indemnification obligations under
                           Section 12.1.3, or resulting from a breach of a
                           representation or warranty under Sections 7 or 8 of
                           this Agreement (including a deemed breach of a
                           representation or warranty as provided in



                                     -136-
<PAGE>

                           the proviso in Section 12.1.1 of this Agreement),
                           except to the extent such party's aggregate Liability
                           for all such indemnification obligations (without
                           regard to any materiality, Company Material Adverse
                           Effect qualifier(s) or Buyer Material Adverse Effect
                           qualifier(s) contained in any representations and
                           warranties set forth in this Agreement) exceeds
                           Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000); provided,
                           however, Seller's indemnity obligations set forth in
                           Section 7.6 and any matter constituting fraud or
                           intentional misrepresentation by Buyer or Seller in
                           connection with the transactions contemplated herein
                           shall not be subject to the foregoing limitation.

                  12.5.2   CAP. Each party's aggregate Liability for
                           indemnification under this Agreement shall in no
                           event exceed Two Hundred Million Dollars
                           ($200,000,000); provided however, that each party's
                           indemnity obligations set forth in Section 13 and any
                           matter constituting fraud, intentional
                           misrepresentation or criminal activity under
                           applicable Law shall not be subject to the foregoing
                           limitation.

                  12.5.3   REMEDIES. Other than equitable remedies available at
                           law to either party (including specific performance),
                           after Closing the provisions of this Section 12 and
                           Section 13 shall be the exclusive basis for the
                           assertion of claims against, or the imposition of
                           Liability on, Seller or its Affiliates, or Buyer or
                           its Affiliates, in respect to the transactions
                           contemplated herein, including, without limitation,
                           any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement;
                           provided that this paragraph shall not limit any
                           remedies available for breaches of the Voting
                           Agreement or any agreement executed at Closing
                           pursuant to this Agreement.

                  12.5.4   MITIGATION. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause
                           their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
                           efforts to mitigate the losses, costs, expenses and
                           damages for which such party or their Affiliates may
                           become entitled to indemnification hereunder.

                  12.5.5   NET RECOVERY. The amount to which an Indemnified
                           Party may become entitled pursuant to the
                           indemnification provisions of this Agreement shall be
                           net of any recovery (whether by way of payment,
                           discount, credit, set off, tax benefit, counterclaim
                           or otherwise) received by such party or its
                           Affiliates from a third party (including any insurer
                           or taxation authority) in respect of such claim. Any
                           such recovery shall be promptly repaid by Buyer to
                           Seller, or Seller to Buyer, as applicable, less any
                           taxes payable on the recovery and all reasonable
                           costs, charges and expenses incurred in obtaining
                           such recovery from the third party. For the avoidance
                           of doubt, a Tax benefit shall only be taken into
                           account under this paragraph to the extent that that
                           the Tax benefit results in a lower Tax liability for
                           the Indemnified Party than would have occurred absent
                           the indemnity payment and the Tax benefit is actually
                           recognized on a Tax Return.

                  12.5.6   LIMITATION OF DAMAGES. Each party shall be
                           responsible only for direct damages, and shall in no
                           event be liable for special, consequential or similar
                           damages or losses.

                  12.5.7   SATISFACTION OF INDEMNITY CLAIMS. Notwithstanding any
                           of the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the
                           contrary, except for each party's



                                     -138-
<PAGE>

                           indemnity obligations under Section 13, all amounts
                           payable by Seller to Buyer with respect to any
                           indemnity claim brought by Buyer under this
                           Agreement, shall be satisfied, at the Seller's
                           option, either by Seller delivering to Buyer for
                           cancellation that portion of the Subordinated
                           Promissory Note that has a principal amount equal to
                           the amount of the indemnity claim owed by Seller, or
                           by payment of cash. Notwithstanding any of the terms
                           and conditions of this Agreement to the contrary, all
                           amounts payable by Buyer to Seller with respect to
                           any indemnity claim brought by Seller under this
                           Agreement, shall be satisfied, at Buyer's option,
                           either by increasing the amounts due and owing under
                           the Subordinated Promissory Note in an amount equal
                           to the amount of the indemnity claim owed by Buyer,
                           or by the payment of cash. All payments with respect
                           to indemnity claims shall be made promptly.

         13.      SPECIAL TAX INDEMNITY.

         13.1     TAX RETURNS.

                  13.1.1   Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to consent
                           to join, for all taxable periods of the Acquired
                           Companies ending on or before the Closing Date for
                           which the Acquired Companies are eligible to do so,
                           in any consolidated or combined federal, state or
                           local Tax Returns of Seller or Seller's Affiliates.
                           Seller will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
                           and filed, all of the Acquired Company Tax Returns
                           for all taxable years or periods ending on or before
                           the Closing Date (to the extent they have not already
                           done so). Seller will pay to the applicable
                           Governmental

                           Authority, or cause the payment to the applicable
                           Governmental Authority of, any Taxes shown as due
                           thereon. Seller will prepare, or cause to be
                           prepared, such Tax Returns using material accounting
                           methods and other practices that are consistent with
                           those used by the Acquired Companies in their prior
                           Tax Returns except as otherwise required by Law.
                           Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may revoke the
                           election of To-Ricos under Code Section 936, in which
                           event, Buyer will reasonably cooperate with Seller,
                           and cause To-Ricos to consent to join in the filing
                           of any federal, state or local consolidated or
                           combined Tax Return with Seller and its affiliated
                           group for the taxable year or period ending on the
                           Closing Date. Items to be taken into account in any
                           Tax Return for the short taxable period ending on the
                           Closing Date will be determined under the
                           "closing-the-books" method as described in Treasury
                           Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (or any similar
                           provision of state, local or foreign Law). Seller
                           will deliver, or cause to be delivered, a draft of
                           each of the Tax Returns for any of the Acquired
                           Companies that require the signature of an officer or
                           employee of Buyer (or one of Buyer's Affiliates) to
                           Buyer not less than 30 days prior to the due date (as
                           may be extended) for filing such Tax Returns, and
                           Buyer will provide Seller with its comments on, and
                           proposed changes to, such Tax Returns not later than
                           15 days prior to such due date. If any aspect of such
                           Tax Returns remains in dispute within 10 days prior
                           to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, the
                           matter in dispute will be submitted to a mutually
                           acceptable,

                           nationally-recognized firm of certified public
                           accountants for resolution. The decision of such
                           accountant will be final and binding on the parties,
                           and the fees and expenses of the accountant will be
                           paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.
                           Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be
                           entitled to object to any Tax Return prepared by
                           Seller unless the accountant concludes that a
                           position claimed in the Tax Return does not possess
                           the level of support required to avoid the
                           substantial understatement penalty provided for in
                           Section 6662(d) of the Code.

                  13.1.2   Buyer will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
                           and filed, all of the Acquired Companies' Tax Returns
                           for all taxable years or periods ending after the
                           Closing Date, and Buyer will pay, or cause to be
                           paid, all Taxes shown as due thereon; provided, that
                           with respect to any Straddle Period, Buyer will be
                           entitled to indemnification as set forth in Section
                           13.3.

                  13.1.3   The parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each
                           other and each other's Affiliates in the preparation
                           and filing of Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies
                           for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
                           Date and Straddle Periods. The parties shall be
                           entitled to utilize the services of the personnel who
                           would have been responsible for preparing such
                           returns as they relate to the Acquired Companies,
                           without charge, to the extent reasonably necessary in
                           preparing said returns on a timely basis. The parties
                           shall also provide each other with full access to
                           applicable and reasonably relevant records to enable
                           the timely preparation and filing of said returns.

         13.2     Apportionment of Taxes. With respect to any Straddle Period of
                  the Acquired Companies, Buyer and Seller will, to the extent
                  permitted by law, elect to treat the Closing Date as the last
                  day of the taxable year or period of the Acquired Companies
                  and will apportion any Taxes arising out of or relating to a
                  Straddle Period to the Pre-Closing Period under the
                  "closing-the-books" method as described in Treasury Regulation
                  Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (or any similar provision of state,
                  local or foreign Law). In any case where applicable Law does
                  not permit the Acquired Companies to treat the Closing Date as
                  the last day of the taxable year or period, any Taxes arising
                  out of or relating to a Straddle Period will be apportioned to
                  the Pre-Closing Period based on a closing of the books of that
                  entity; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or
                  deductions (excluding depreciation, amortization and depletion
                  deductions) that are calculated on an annualized basis will be
                  apportioned on a daily pro rata basis. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, Taxes imposed with respect to a time period (e.g.,
                  property taxes) shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period
                  on a daily pro rata basis.

         13.3     Indemnification by Seller. Seller will indemnify and hold
                  harmless the Buyer and the directors, officers, employees and
                  Affiliates of Buyer ("Buyer Indemnified Persons") for, and
                  will pay to, or on behalf of, Buyer Indemnified Persons an
                  amount equal to (a) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
                  the Pre-Closing Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
                  any Taxes of the Acquired Companies resulting from an election
                  under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) that have not been paid
                  prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent accrued as a

                  Liability on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, (b) any Taxes
                  relating to any member of an affiliated group with which any
                  of the Acquired Companies has filed a Tax Return on a
                  consolidated, combined or unitary basis for a Pre-Closing
                  Period, and (c) any Tax deficiency, and all related,
                  reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses, each
                  directly resulting from any breach of Seller's representations
                  in Section 7.10(d), (e), (f), (g), and (i) or Seller's
                  covenants contained in this Section 13.

         13.4     Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer will pay, or cause to be paid,
                  on a timely basis, and shall indemnify, defend and hold
                  harmless Seller and the directors, officers, employees and
                  Affiliates of Seller ("Seller Indemnified Persons") for: (a)
                  any Tax deficiency, and all related, reasonable legal and
                  accounting fees and expenses, each directly resulting from any
                  breach of Buyer's representations in Section 8.26(d), (e), (g)
                  and (h) or Buyer's covenants contained in this Section 13, (b)
                  any Liability for Taxes for Tax periods of the Buyer and the
                  Acquired Companies beginning, and the portion of the Straddle
                  Period occurring, after the Closing Date, and (c) any
                  Liability for Taxes attributable to an extraordinary
                  transaction (other than the distribution of the Retained
                  Assets or any deemed asset sale occurring under section
                  338(h)(10) or any comparable provision of state or local Law)
                  effected at the direction of Buyer in respect of the Acquired
                  Companies on or after the Effective Time.

         13.5     Indemnification Process. In the event of a third-party claim
                  for Taxes arising out of or relating to any taxable year or
                  period of an Acquired Company ending on or before the Closing
                  Date, the indemnification procedures will be in accordance




                                     -143-
<PAGE>

                  with Section 12.3 and the limitations contained in Sections
                  12.5.3 through 12.5.6 (inclusive); provided however, that with
                  respect to any Tax matter involving a Governmental Authority
                  that does not treat the Acquired Companies as selling their
                  assets to a newly created corporation on the Closing Date as a
                  result of the Section 338(h)(10) election, Seller shall not
                  settle or compromise any third-party claim for Taxes that may
                  adversely effect Buyer in taxable periods ending after the
                  Closing Date without Buyer's consent (which shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld). Any indemnification payments due under
                  this Section 13 shall be paid within 10 days from the date of
                  a final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
                  Code) of the amount of Tax due.

         13.6     Characterization of Indemnity Payments. All amounts paid by
                  Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, by reason of Section
                  12.1, 12.2, 13.3 or 13.4 will be treated to the extent
                  permitted under applicable Law as adjustments to the Purchase
                  Price for all Tax purposes.

         13.7     Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                  Agreement, all Transfer Taxes will be borne by Seller
                  regardless of which party is obligated to pay such Tax under
                  applicable Law. Buyer and Seller will cooperate in timely
                  making and filing all Tax Returns that may be required to
                  comply with Law relating to such Taxes.

         13.8     Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller will cause the Acquired
                  Companies to terminate as of the Closing Date any tax sharing,
                  indemnity or allocation agreement between them and: (i) any
                  other Affiliate of the Seller; (ii) Renewable

                  Environmental Solutions, L.L.C.; or (iii) any partner of
                  Renewable Environmental Solutions, L.L.C..

         13.9     Tax Records. Seller will make available to Buyer such records
                  as Buyer may require for the preparation of any Tax Return and
                  such records as Buyer may require for the defense of any
                  proceeding concerning such Tax Return. Buyer will make
                  available to Seller such records as Seller may require for the
                  preparation of any Tax Return and such records as Seller may
                  require for the defense of any proceeding concerning any such
                  Tax Return.

         13.10    Refunds. Buyer and its Affiliates shall pay to Seller within
                  ten (10) days of receipt any refund of Taxes: (i) that relate
                  to a Pre-Closing Period of the Acquired Companies; (ii) that
                  were paid by Seller or its Affiliates; and (iii) to the extent
                  that any such refunds were not accrued as an asset on the
                  Final Closing Balance Sheet.

         13.11    Survival. The covenants and agreements of the parties
                  contained in this Section 13 and the representations and
                  warranties contained in Section 7.10(d), (e), (f), (g) and (i)
                  and Section 8.26 (d), (e), (g) and (h) will survive the
                  Closing and will remain in full force and effect until thirty
                  (30) days following the expiration of the applicable
                  underlying statutes of limitations (including extensions) with
                  respect to any Taxes that would be indemnifiable by Buyer or
                  Seller under Sections 13.3 and 13.4 of this Agreement.

         13.12    Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller agrees that it will, and
                  with Buyer's and the Acquired Companies' full cooperation,
                  prepare and make an election or join in making an election
                  under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code in order to treat the
                  sale of the Stock as a sale of all of the assets of the
                  Acquired Companies for U.S.

                  federal Tax purposes and an election under the statutes of
                  such states as permit an equivalent election. Seller and Buyer
                  will not make a joint election under the corresponding
                  provisions of Puerto Rican law. Seller agrees that it will,
                  and with Buyer's and the Acquired Companies' full cooperation,
                  take such action to comply with all of the requirements and
                  conditions of Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the treasury
                  regulations thereunder and all other applicable Code sections
                  and treasury regulations relating thereto, including without
                  limitation the execution and timely filing of Form 8023
                  entitled "Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making
                  Qualified Stock Purchases" or any successor form of similar
                  import, and any forms required to effectuate similar elections
                  for state tax purposes. The parties agree that the Purchase
                  Price shall be allocated to the assets of the Acquired
                  Companies in accordance with Exhibit 13.12 hereto. Each party
                  covenants to report gain, loss, or cost basis, as the case may
                  be, in a manner consistent with Exhibit 13.12 for federal and
                  state Tax purposes. Buyer, the Acquired Companies and Seller
                  shall promptly notify Seller (and Seller will promptly notify
                  Buyer) in the event that any Governmental Authority challenges
                  or threatens to challenge, such allocations. Buyer, the
                  Acquired Companies, and Seller shall cooperate after the
                  Closing Date to timely and properly file all applicable
                  federal and state elections required to be filed under this
                  Section and to take all such action as is required by Law to
                  give full effect to the elections for federal, state and local
                  Tax purposes to the greatest extent permitted by Law. Buyer,
                  the Acquired Companies and Seller shall fully cooperate in
                  order to qualify To-Ricos for the application of such election
                  to To-Ricos.

         13.13    Miscellaneous Tax Provisions. In no event shall any party
                  hereto pay more than once under different provisions of this
                  Agreement for the same Tax Liability. Notwithstanding anything
                  to the contrary herein, if Closing occurs, this Section 13 and
                  Sections 12.3, and 12.5.3 through 12.5.6 (inclusive) (to the
                  extent they govern the indemnification process for Taxes)
                  shall be the sole remedy for any Tax matters under this
                  Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
                  Section 12.5.1 do not apply to this Section 13.

         13.14    Puerto Rican Tax Incentives. The parties will fully cooperate
                  with each other to maintain (to the extent reasonably possible
                  under Puerto Rican Law) To-Ricos': (i) Grant of Industrial Tax
                  Exemption pursuant to the 1987 Puerto Rican Tax Incentives Act
                  (the "Industrial Grant"); and (ii) Certificate of Exemption
                  under the Agricultural Incentives Act (1995) ("Agricultural
                  Certificate") after Closing until such time as To-Ricos can
                  negotiate a modification of the Industrial Grant, obtain a new
                  Industrial Grant under the 1998 Puerto Rican Tax Incentives
                  Act, or ensure the continuation of its Agricultural
                  Certificate. Provided however, Seller's obligation to
                  cooperate with Buyer with respect to this matter shall cease
                  no later than one calendar year following the Closing Date;
                  provided, further Seller's obligation to so cooperate shall
                  not (x) include any obligation to start or continue to own or
                  conduct any entity or business in Puerto Rico or (y) preclude
                  Seller or any Affiliate of Seller from conducting or changing
                  any Puerto Rican business operation or activity, including
                  Molinos de Puerto Rico, Inc.'s activities, in any manner as
                  Seller or any Affiliate of Seller may determine.

         14.      MISCELLANEOUS. The following miscellaneous provisions shall
                  apply to this Agreement:

         14.2     AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. This Agreement may not be modified or
                  amended, except by an instrument or instruments in writing,

                  Buyer may, by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by
                  the other party with any term or provision of this Agreement
                  on the part of such other party to be performed or complied
                  with. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
                  any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
                  deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action
                  of compliance with any representation, warranty or agreement
                  contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach
                  of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be
                  construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

         14.3     EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
                  Buyer and Seller shall each pay their own expenses, and those
                  of their respective Affiliates, in connection with the
                  preparation and execution of this Agreement and any expenses
                  specifically payable by them pursuant to this Agreement.

         14.4     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Subject to Section
                  13.11 hereof, the representations and warranties and
                  indemnities related thereto of Seller and Buyer made in or
                  pursuant to this Agreement shall survive as follows:
                  representations and warranties, and the indemnities relating
                  thereto, under Sections 7.16, 7.17 (except with respect to
                  ERISA matters), 7.18, 8.14, 8.15 (except with respect to ERISA
                  matters) and 8.16 shall survive the Closing for a period of
                  four (4) years; representations and warranties, and the
                  indemnities relating thereto, under Section 7.1, Section 7.3,
                  Section 7.6, Section 7.7.2, Section 7.17 (with respect to
                  ERISA matters) and Sections 8.1, 8.4 and 8.15 (with respect to
                  ERISA matters) shall survive the Closing until expiration of
                  the applicable statute of limitations; and all other
                  representations and warranties, and the indemnities relating
                  thereto, under this




                                     -149-
<PAGE>

                  Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve
                  (12) months. Indemnities relating to the breach of any
                  covenant shall survive until expiration of the applicable
                  statute of limitations. Notwithstanding the forgoing, it is
                  specifically understood and agreed that the damages for which
                  indemnification may be sought need not be incurred or paid by
                  the Indemnified Party within the forgoing periods, but only
                  that the claim with respect to which indemnification is sought
                  be asserted and presented to the Indemnifying Party within
                  such periods.

         14.5     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements,
                  the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
                  and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
                  agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
                  matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
                  understandings, oral and written, among the parties hereto
                  with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         14.6     TERMS OF SALE. The parties agree and acknowledge, on behalf of
                  themselves and their Affiliates, that EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
                  SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE ANCILLARY
                  AGREEMENTS, THE STOCK AND THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES ARE BEING
                  SOLD TO BUYER, AND THE SHARES ARE BEING ISSUED TO SELLER,
                  WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
                  OTHER THAN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET
                  FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS. EXCEPT
                  FOR CLAIMS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THIS
                  AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, NO CLAIM SHALL BE MADE
                  AGAINST EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES,




                                     -150-

                  BY THE OTHER PARTY, IN RESPECT TO ANY REPRESENTATION,
                  WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, COVENANT OR UNDERTAKING. THE PARTIES
                  CONFIRM THAT THEY HAVE NOT RELIED ON ANY REPRESENTATION,
                  WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, COVENANT OR UNDERTAKING OF ANY PERSON
                  WHICH IS NOT EXPRESSLY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
                  ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, SELLER MAKES
                  NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH
                  RESPECT TO ANY TAX ATTRIBUTES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES.

         14.7     APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement and the legal relations among
                  the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in
                  accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable
                  to contracts made and performed in Delaware (without regard to
                  conflicts of law doctrines).

         14.8     BINDING EFFECT; BENEFITS. This Agreement shall inure to the
                  benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
                  respective successors and assigns; nothing in this Agreement,
                  express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other
                  than the parties hereto or their respective successors and
                  assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
                  under or by reason of this Agreement.

         14.9     ASSIGNABILITY. Neither this Agreement nor any of the parties'
                  rights hereunder shall be assignable by any party hereto
                  without the prior written consent of the other party hereto.

         14.10    EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The headings of the various sections and
                  subsections herein are inserted merely as a matter of
                  convenience and for reference and shall not be




                                     -151-
<PAGE>

                  construed as in any manner defining, limiting, or describing
                  the scope or intent of the particular sections to which they
                  refer, or as affecting the meaning or construction of the
                  language in the body of such sections.

         14.11    EXHIBITS; DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. All exhibits and schedules
                  referred to in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
                  reference as if fully set forth herein. The disclosure of any
                  matter in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the
                  Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
                  admission by any party or to otherwise imply that any such
                  matter is material or may have a Company or Buyer Material
                  Adverse Effect, as the case may be, for purposes of this
                  Agreement.

         14.12    SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
                  invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be
                  ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
                  unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
                  the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
                  affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
                  or other provisions of this Agreement in any other
                  jurisdiction.

         14.13    CONSTRUCTION AND INTERPRETATION. As used in this Agreement in
                  respect to Seller and Buyer, "knowledge," "knows" or "known"
                  means, with respect to the matter in question, if any of the
                  Executive Officers of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, has
                  actual knowledge of such matter. "Executive Officers" of
                  Seller means those executive officers of Seller and the
                  Acquired Companies listed on Exhibit 14.13 hereto, and
                  "Executive Officers" of Buyer means those executive officers
                  of Buyer listed on Exhibit 14.13 hereto. The language in all
                  parts of this Agreement shall in all cases be construed as a
                  whole according to its fair meaning, strictly neither for




                                     -152-
<PAGE>

                  nor against any party hereto, and without implying a
                  presumption that the terms thereof shall be more strictly
                  construed against one party by reason of the rule of
                  construction that a document is to be construed more strictly
                  against the person who himself drafted same. It is hereby
                  agreed that representatives of both parties have participated
                  in the preparation hereof. The word "or" is not exclusive and
                  the word "including" means "including without limitation."

         14.14    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
                  counterparts, each of which shall be regarded as an original
                  and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         14.15    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
                  submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any United States
                  federal or Delaware state court sitting in Wilmington,
                  Delaware with respect to any action or proceeding arising out
                  of or relating to this Agreement and each of the parties
                  hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
                  such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any
                  such court and irrevocably waives any objection it may now or
                  hereafter have as to the venue of any such suit, action or
                  proceeding brought in such court or that such court is an
                  inconvenient forum. The parties hereto shall cause the
                  Acquired Companies to be bound by this Section.

         14.16    FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of the parties hereto agrees that,
                  from and after the Closing, upon the reasonable request of the
                  other party hereto and without further consideration, such
                  party will execute and deliver to such other party such
                  documents and further assurances and will take such other
                  actions (without cost to such party) as such other party may
                  reasonably request in order to carry out the




                                     -153-
<PAGE>

                  purpose and intention of this Agreement. Such actions shall
                  include, without limitation, the transfer or conveyance by
                  Buyer, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates
                  and successors of any assets or rights included in the
                  Retained Assets, the transfer or conveyance by Seller or its
                  Affiliates and successors of any assets or rights included in
                  the Business, and Seller's commercially reasonable cooperation
                  at Buyer's cost in connection with the preparation of any
                  materials required to be filed by Buyer with the SEC or any
                  financing Buyer may seek.

         14.17    PUBLICITY. The parties hereto agree that they will consult
                  with each other concerning any proposed press release or
                  public announcement pertaining to the transactions
                  contemplated hereby and shall use their best efforts to agree
                  upon the text of any such press release or the making of such
                  public announcement. The parties hereto agree that the
                  issuance of any such press release or announcement shall not
                  be a violation of the Confidentiality Agreement.
