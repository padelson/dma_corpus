iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of November 14,
2005, among Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
("Parent"), Susquehanna Patriot Bank, a New Jersey state chartered bank and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("SPB"), and Minotola National Bank, a
national banking association (the "Bank"). SPB and the Bank are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Constituent Banks."



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, SPB and the Bank have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective entities and
their shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction
provided for herein in which the Bank will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into SPB;



WHEREAS, to induce Parent and SPB to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of the Bank, who hold approximately 60% of the issued
and outstanding shares of common stock of the Bank (the "Principal
Shareholders"), have agreed to support the Merger and to vote their shares in
favor thereof; and 



WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the National Bank Act and the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948,
as amended (the "NJ Banking Act"), at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.2 hereof), the Bank shall merge with and into SPB. SPB shall be the
surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes called the "Receiving Bank") in the
Merger, and shall continue its existence as a New Jersey banking corporation
under the NJ Banking Act. The name of the Receiving Bank shall continue to be
Susquehanna Patriot Bank. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
existence of the Bank shall cease.



1.2  _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Bank
Merger Agreement (as defined in Section 1.3) and the accompanying
certification required by Section 137 of the NJ Banking Act (collectively, the
"Certified Bank Merger Agreement") shall be duly prepared, executed and
delivered for filing with the Department of Banking and Insurance of the State
of New Jersey (the "Department"), on the Closing Date (as defined in Section
10.1 hereof). The Merger shall become effective (such time, the "Effective
Time") at such time as the Certified Bank Merger Agreement is filed with the
Department, or at such later time as may be specified in the Certified Bank
Merger Agreement.



 

1 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the National Bank
Act and the NJ Banking Act. In connection with the execution of this
Agreement, SPB and the Bank shall execute and deliver a separate merger
agreement (the "Bank Merger Agreement") in the form of Appendix A hereto.



1.4 _Conversion of Bank Common Stock_.



(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article I,
and Sections 2.2(e) and Section 9.1(g) hereof, each share of the common stock,
par value $70.00 per share, of the Bank (the "Bank Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares, as defined below, and shares of Bank Common Stock held directly or
indirectly by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except
for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section
1.4(d) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the
right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and
subject to the provisions of Section 1.5, either (i) the Per Share Stock
Consideration (as defined below) or (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as
defined below). The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share
Cash Consideration are referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."



For purposes of this Agreement:



"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of shares of common stock,
par value $2.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the
Exchange Ratio.



"Per Share Cash Consideration" shall mean $3,226.44.



"Exchange Ratio" shall mean 134.



"Total Cash Amount" shall equal (x) the product of the Per Share Cash
Consideration multiplied by 30% of the outstanding shares of Bank Common Stock
as of the close of business on the Determination Date, calculated on a Fully
Diluted Basis (as defined below), (y) then reduced by an amount equal to
the number of Dissenting Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash
Consideration, and (z) further reduced by an amount equal to all cash paid to
former shareholders of the Bank in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(e). For purposes of this calculation, the term
"Fully Diluted Basis" shall mean all outstanding shares of Bank Common Stock
(including all outstanding shares of Bank Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Banks Stock Bonus Plan, whether or not such shares are fully vested),
excluding shares of Bank Common Stock held in treasury.



"Determination Date" shall mean the third calendar day immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or if such calendar day is not a trading day on the
NASDAQ/NMS, then the trading day immediately preceding such calendar day.



 

2 (b) All of the shares of Bank Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of Bank Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration,
(ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(b)
hereof, and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof.



(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class
of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or similar transaction, or a
stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such
period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock
Consideration.



(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Bank Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
shares of Bank Common Stock (x) held directly or indirectly in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for
the benefit of third parties (any such shares, and shares of Parent Common
Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by SPB or
the Bank, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account
Shares") and (y) held by SPB or the Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares of
Bank Common Stock, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly
held, whether held directly or indirectly by SPB or the Bank, being referred
to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the Bank or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be
become treasury stock of Parent.



(e) At the Effective Time, each award granted by the Bank under its
Stock Bonus Plan which is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to date
of this Agreement shall vest and become free of any restrictions to which they
are subject under the Stock Bonus Plan.



(f) The calculations required by Section 1.4(a) shall be prepared jointly by
Parent, SPB and the Bank prior to the Closing Date.



1.5 _Election Procedures_.



(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing shares of Bank
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to
the Exchange Agent (as defined below)) in such form as Parent and the Bank
shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") shall be mailed 35 days prior to
the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as the Bank and SPB
shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Bank
Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth business day prior to
the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date") other than holders of
Dissenting Shares.



 

3 (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Bank Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock
Election Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of such holders Bank Common
Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration ("Cash Election Shares"), or (iii) that such holder makes no
election with respect to such holders Bank Common Stock ("No Election
Shares"). Any Bank Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has
not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00
p.m., on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date
as Parent and the Bank may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall
also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."



(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Bank Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline (other than holders of Dissenting Shares), and the Bank shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to
perform as specified herein.



(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by
the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed
only if accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Bank
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form at or prior to
the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Bank Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares, and Parent shall cause the
certificates representing such Bank Common Stock to be promptly returned
without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request
to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent as to
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent, SPB nor the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in an Election Form.



(e) Within ten business days after the Election Deadline, unless
the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among the holders of Bank Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common
Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:



 

4 (1) _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the sum of the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of
the Cash Election Shares (such sum hereinafter, the "Section 1.5(e) Cash
Amount") is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:



(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,



(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Stock
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, and



(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.



(2) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:



(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,



(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No
Election Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration, and



 

(C) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.



(3) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to
the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (1) and (2) above shall not apply
and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.



(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent
shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and the Bank.



 

5 1.6 _SPB Common Stock_. The shares of SPB Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and
such shares shall remain issued and outstanding.



1.7 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of SPB, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Receiving Bank.



1.8 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of SPB, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Receiving
Bank until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.9 _Directors and Officers_.



(a) At and after the Effective Time, the directors of SPB shall consist
of all of the directors of SPB serving immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the additional persons who shall become directors of SPB in
accordance with Section 7.13 hereof, each to hold office in accordance with
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Receiving Bank until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



(b) The officers of SPB immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Receiving Bank, each to hold office in accordance with
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Receiving Bank until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



1.10 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any holder of Bank Common Stock shall have the right to dissent in
the manner provided in the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 214a(b), and if all
necessary requirements of the National Bank Act are met, such shares shall be
entitled to payment in cash from SPB of the fair value of such shares as
determined in accordance with the National Bank Act. All shares of Bank
Common Stock as to which the holder properly exercises dissenters rights in
accordance with the National Bank Act constitute "Dissenting Shares" unless
and until such rights are waived, by the party initially seeking to exercise
such rights.



1.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Section 368 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.



ARTICLE II



EXCHANGE OF SHARES



2.1 _Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent")
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Bank, for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
(i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
 



 

6  pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Bank Common Stock, (ii) such cash as shall be necessary to pay the Per
Share Cash Consideration in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 2.2(a) hereof,
and (iii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid in accordance with
Section 2.2(e) hereof. Such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."



2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in no event more than three business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who
theretofore has not submitted such holders Certificate or Certificates with a
properly completed Election Form, a form letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The Bank shall have
the right to review both the letter of transmittal and the instructions prior
to the Effective Time and provide reasonable comments thereon. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 1.5 and upon
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with a properly executed letter of transmittal or
Election Form, as the case may be, the holder of such Certificate
or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder of Bank Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to
the provisions of Article I hereof and/or (y) a check representing the
aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and/or the amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of Article I, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Per
Share Cash Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.



(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.



 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.



 

7 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Bank of the shares of Bank Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock or cash or both, as
provided in this Article II.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay
to each former shareholder of the Bank who otherwise would be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) $24.00 by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.4 hereof.



(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of the Bank for twelve months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Bank who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or the
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Bank Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, SPB, the Bank, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Bank Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



ARTICLE III



DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES



Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Bank has delivered
to Parent and SPB, and Parent has delivered to the Bank, a schedule (in the
case of the Bank, the "Bank Disclosure Schedule," and in the case of Parent,
the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items
the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an

8 ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BANK



Subject to Article III, the Bank hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
SPB as follows:



4.1 _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Bank is a national banking association
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
United States of America. The Bank has the corporate power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on the Bank. The Articles of Association and Bylaws of the Bank, copies
of which have previously been made available to SPB, are true and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Bank Insurance Fund to the fullest
extent permitted by law, and all premiums and assessments required to be paid
in connection therewith have been paid when due. As used in this Agreement,
the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Parent or the Bank,
as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, other than any such effect attributable to or resulting from (v) any
change in banking or similar laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental
authorities, (w) any change in GAAP or regulatory accounting principles
applicable to banks, thrifts or their holding companies generally, (x)
changes attributable to or resulting from changes in general economic
conditions, including changes in the prevailing level of interest rates, (y)
any action or omission of the Bank or Parent or any Subsidiary of either of
them taken in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or with the prior
written consent of the other party hereto, or (z) any expenses incurred by
such party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (ii) the ability of such party and its Subsidiaries to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) Each of the Banks Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization. Each of the Banks Subsidiaries has the corporate (or
equivalent) power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or the location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be licensed or qualified
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on such Subsidiary. The certificates
of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of
the Bank, copies of which have previously been made available to Parent, are
true and correct copies of such  



 

9  documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party
means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes.



(c) The minute books of the Bank and each of its Subsidiaries contain
true and correct records of all meetings and other corporate (or equivalent)
actions held or taken since December 31, 2001 through August 31, 2005 of their
respective shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be, and Boards
of Directors or similar governing authority (including committees thereof).



4.2 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists
only of 52,000 shares of Bank Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement,
there were 51,140 shares of Bank Common Stock issued and outstanding. As of
the date of this Agreement, there were 860 shares of Bank Common Stock
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Banks stock bonus plan (the "Stock
Bonus Plan"). All of the issued and outstanding shares of Bank Common Stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. The Bank does not have and is not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares
of Bank Common Stock or any other equity security of the Bank or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of Bank Common Stock or any other equity security of the Bank.



(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Bank. The Bank owns, directly
or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock
or other equity interests of each of such Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and all of
such shares or equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of the Bank has or
is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity interest of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity interest of such
Subsidiary.



4.3 _Authority; No Violation_. (a) The Bank has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The
Board of Directors of the Bank has directed that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the Banks shareholders for
approval at a meeting of such shareholders and, except for the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Banks shareholders,
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Bank are necessary to
approve this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Bank
and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and SPB)
this Agreement  



 

10  constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Bank, enforceable against
the Bank in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited
by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court
of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and similar laws
affecting creditors rights and remedies generally.



(b) Except as may be set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Bank
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Bank Merger Agreement by the Bank, nor the consummation by the Bank of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by the Bank with
any of the terms or provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the Articles of Association or Bylaws of the Bank or the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or similar governing documents of any of
its Subsidiaries, or (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred
to in Section 4.4 hereof are duly obtained, (x) violate any statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective

provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other encumbrance
upon any of the respective material properties or assets of the Bank or any
of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, or by which they or any of their respective material properties or
assets may be bound or affected.



4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the approval of this Agreement by
the requisite vote of the shareholders of the Bank, and (b) such filings,
authorizations or approvals as may be set forth in Section 4.4 of the Bank
Disclosure Schedule, no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations
with any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality (each a "Governmental Entity") or with any third
party are required to be made by the Bank in connection with (1) the execution
and delivery by the Bank of this Agreement and (2) the consummation by the
Bank of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



4.5 _Regulatory Reports_. The Bank and each of its Subsidiaries have timely
filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file
since December 31, 2000 with the Comptroller of the Currency (the

or claiming regulatory jurisdiction over them, or any self-regulatory
organization ("SRO," and collectively with the Comptroller and such other
regulatory authorities, the "Regulatory Agencies"), and have paid all fees
and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except for normal
examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the regular course of the
business of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, and except as may be set forth in

any Plan will not materially increase as a result of the Merger; each of the

account of a Plan pursuant to Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premiums due the PBGC); no contract, Plan or arrangement (written or
otherwise) (including provisions that become operative by virtue of this
Agreement) covering any employee or former employee of the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries provides for payments that would not be deductible under Section
162(m) of the Code; no contract, Plan or arrangement (written or otherwise)
(including provisions that become operative by virtue of this Agreement)
covering any disqualified individual (within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code) of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries provides for payments
(including but not limited to liability associated with any gross-up payment
under any such contract, Plan or arrangement) that will result in any
nondeductible compensation under Section 280G(a) of the Code or will result in
an excise tax payable by such disqualified individuals under Section 4999 of
the Code; no Plan contains any provision or is subject to any law that would
prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that would give

have been operated and maintained in accordance with such requirements and
neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement
with, or has any obligation, direct or indirect, to, any current or former
employee, director, independent contractor or agent to indemnify such
individual for any excise or other taxes that would result from the failure to
operate such Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code; no Plan is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and no Plan is a multiple employer plan as defined in
Section 413 of the Code; and there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Bank, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims for
benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Plans or any trusts related
thereto.

any other document filed with any other regulatory agency in connection
herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



7.1 _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the
SEC the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of the Bank and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and the Bank shall thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to
its shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
as promptly as practicable all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger). The Bank and Parent shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to the Bank or Parent, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated herein. 



(c) Parent and the Bank shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of parent, the
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(d) Parent and the Bank shall promptly furnish each other with copies
of written communications received by Parent or the Bank, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates or associates (as such
terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the
date of this Agreement) from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any
Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.



7.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each party shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives
and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Neither
party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose  



 

28  information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b) All information furnished by either party to the other pursuant to
Section 7.2(a) shall be subject to, and the receiving party shall hold all
such information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreements, dated July 27, 2005 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Parent and the Bank.



(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth herein.



7.3 _Certain Actions_. (a) Except with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and except as otherwise permitted in this
Section 7.3, the Bank will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its
directors, officers, agents, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, agents, affiliates (as such term is used in Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act) or representatives (collectively, "Representatives")
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or take any
action to facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiries with respect to or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the
Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by any third party that is seeking to make, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, (v) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent its recommendation to its shareholders referred to in Section 7.4
hereof, or (vi) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Bank.



(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Bank and its Board of
Directors shall be permitted (i) to engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information to, any person in response to a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) by any such person, if and only to the extent that
(x) the Banks Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to do so would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Banks shareholders under applicable law, (y) prior to
providing any information or data to any person in connection with a Superior
Proposal by any such person, the Banks Board of Directors receives from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the
Bank than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which
executed confidentiality agreement shall have been provided to Parent for
informational purposes), and (z) at least 72 hours prior to providing any
information or data to any person or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any person, the Bank notifies Parent in writing promptly
of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information  



 

29  requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with, any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and (ii) to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its shareholders
referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior Proposal. The
Bank will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any information related thereto,
which notification shall describe the Acquisition Proposal and identify the
third party making the same.



(c) The Bank agrees that it will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



(d) For purposes of this Section 7.3:



(i) The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender offer or exchange offer
or any proposal for a merger, acquisition of all of the stock or assets of, or
other business combination involving the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or
the acquisition of a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion
of the assets of, the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries.



(ii) The term "Superior Proposal" means, with respect to the Bank, any bona-
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made by a person other than
Parent which is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Bank in good
faith concludes (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel), taking into account, among other things, all break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal, (A) is more favorable to its shareholders (in their capacities
as shareholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for
which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Bank, and (B) is
reasonably capable of being completed.



(e) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Bank shall pay to
Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two (2)
Business Days following such Payment Event, a fee of $7,000,000 (the "Break-up
Fee").



"Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement by SPB pursuant
to Section 9.1(f) (as a result of a breach by the Bank of any of its covenants
under Section 7.3(a) or (c), or Section 7.4) or pursuant to Section 9.1(h), or
(y) the occurrence of any of the following events within twelve (12) months
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c), provided that
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made after the date hereof and prior
to such termination (which shall not have been withdrawn in good faith prior
to such termination): (i) the Bank merges with or into, or is acquired,
directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, a Third Party; (ii) a Third
Party, directly or indirectly acquires more than 50% of  



 

30  the total assets of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) a
Third Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of
the outstanding Bank Common Stock; or (iv) the Bank adopts or implements a
plan of liquidation, recapitalization or share repurchase relating to more
than 50% of the outstanding Bank Common Stock or an extraordinary dividend
relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Bank Common Stock or 50% of the
assets of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As used herein,
"Third Party" means any person as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
(other than Parent or its affiliates).



(f) The Bank acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.3(e) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and that
without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event the Bank fails to pay to Parent the Break-up Fee,
promptly when due, the Bank shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in
collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of
the Break-up Fee (or any unpaid portion thereof), from the date such payment
was due until the date such payment is received by Parent, accrued at the
fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The Wall Street Journal) as in effect
from time to time during the period.



7.4 _Bank Shareholder Meeting_. The Bank shall take all steps necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders to
be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on which the S-4
becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to the right of the Bank and its Board of Directors to take action
permitted by Section 7.3(b) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Bank will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders
approval and adoption of this Agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its
shareholders in connection with this Agreement.



7.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and the Bank shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is
required to be obtained by the Bank or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of
such consent, authorization, order or approval.



 

7.6 _Affiliates_. The Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Bank to deliver to
Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, a written
agreement, in the form of Exhibit 7.6 hereto.



7.7 _Monthly and Interim Financial Statements_. From and after the
date hereof until the Closing or termination of this Agreement under Article
IX, the Bank will deliver to  



 

31  Parent, (a) consolidated statements of income for the Bank and its
Subsidiaries for each month, for that part of the fiscal year ending with such
month and, if such month is the end of a calendar quarter, the calendar
quarter ending with such month, and (b) the related consolidated balance
sheets as at the end of such month, as soon as available and in any event
within 15 calendar days after the end of each calendar month in the case of
the financial statements as of and for the monthly and year-to-date periods,
and within 25 calendar days after the end of such month in the case of the
financial statements as of and for the quarterly periods, in each case
certified by the chief financial officer of the Bank to the effect set forth
in Section 4.6.



7.8 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ/NMS, subject to official notice of
issuance, as of the Effective Time.



7.9 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_. (a) Following the Effective
Time, the employees of the Bank and its Subsidiaries (the "Bank Employees")
shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans, including
severance plans (each a "Parent Plan"), of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, to
the same extent that similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate; provided, however, that, in the case of all benefits
then provided to the Bank Employees, until the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent may instead provide such employees with participation
in the employee benefit plans of the Bank on a basis that is no less favorable
to such employees than those plans in which they participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time (it being understood that inclusion of Bank
Employees in Parents employee benefit plans may occur at different times with
respect to different plans). From and after the Effective Time, Parent may
elect not to provide to the Bank Employees any benefits which are not then
provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their employees notwithstanding
that such benefits were provided by the Bank and its Subsidiaries to their
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the case of benefits
which are provided at the Effective Time by Parent to employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries but are not then provided by the Bank and its Subsidiaries to
their employees, Parent will as soon as possible, and in all events within
one year, after the Effective Time include the Bank Employees in the plans
under which such benefits are made available.



(b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service is taken into
account for any purpose, service with the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Bank provides past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including
for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of
defined benefit pension benefits); provided however, that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations. Each Parent Plan shall
waive pre-existing condition limitations with respect to Bank Employees.
Bank Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding
benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.



 

32 (c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in accordance
with their terms all agreements listed in Section 7.9(c) of the Bank
Disclosure Schedule (the "Benefit Agreements"). Parent acknowledges and agrees
that the Merger will constitute a "change in control" of the Bank for all
purposes under such agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.9(c) are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director,
officer or employee that is a party to any Benefit Agreement.



(d) Any person who is serving as an employee of the Bank as of the date of
this Agreement (other than those employees who, pursuant to Section 7.14
hereof, enter into employment agreements with SPB) whose employment is
discontinued by Parent or SPB within one year after the Effective Time
(unless termination of such employment is for Cause (as defined below)) shall
be entitled to a severance payment from Parent or SPB equal in amount to two
weeks base pay for each full year such employee was employed by the Bank or
any successor or predecessor thereto, subject to a minimum of four weeks
severance and a maximum of 26 weeks severance. For purposes of this Section
7.9(d), "Cause" shall mean termination because of the employees personal
dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty
involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties or
willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic
violations or similar offenses). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Bank may pay cash retention bonuses to employees of the
Bank and its Subsidiaries who are selected by the chief executive officer of
the Bank with the prior approval of Parent, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, in order to help retain key employees through the
Effective Time and for a specified period thereafter, provided that the
aggregate amount of such retention bonuses shall not exceed $200,000. 



(e) On or before the Effective Time, the Bank shall contribute sufficient
funds to the Banks tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan so that the
present value of the accrued benefits of the Banks tax-qualified defined
benefit plan (using the interest rate applicable to lump sum distributions as
of the Effective Time) does not exceed the market value of the assets of such
plan.



7.10 _Indemnification_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Bank,
any of the Subsidiaries of the Bank or any of their respective predecessors
or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law and the Banks
Articles of Association and Bylaws, each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation incurred by each Indemnified Party to
the fullest  



 

33  extent permitted by law and the Banks Articles of Association and Bylaws
upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Parent; provided, however, that (1) Parent shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Parent
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent, and Parent
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (2) Parent shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Parent
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (4) Parent shall
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law, and (5) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party in respect of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, cost,
expense, judgment or amount paid in settlements which arose out of or
resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or criminal acts of
the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification
under this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, provided
that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under
this Section 7.10 except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices Parent. Parents obligations under this Section 7.10 shall
continue in full force and effect without time limit from and after the
Effective Time.



(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period
of three years from the Effective Time by a directors and officers
liability insurance policy having the coverages set forth in Section 7.10(b)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and maintained by Parent or SPB with respect
to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were
committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such.



(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing
or Receiving Bank or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.



(d) The provisions of this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.



 

34 7.11 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Receiving Bank with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to
the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement
and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by Parent.



7.12 _Coordination of Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement each of
Parent and the Bank shall coordinate with the other the declaration of
any dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock and the Bank Common Stock
and the record dates and payments dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties that the holders of Bank Common Stock shall not
receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any
single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Bank Common Stock and
any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Bank Common Stock receives in
exchange therefor in the Merger (it being understood and agreed by the
parties hereto that the dividend which would usually be paid by the Bank in
January 2006 may, at the Banks option, instead be paid in December 2005).



7.13 _Appointment of Directors_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause its Board of Directors to be expanded by one member and shall
appoint Mr. Michael A. Morello to fill the vacancy on Parents Board of
Directors created by such increase. If Mr. Morello does not become a director
of Parent because of death, disability or otherwise, Parent agrees, after
consultation with Messrs. Michael D. Capizola and Dennis W. DiLazzero, to
cause a person who is a member of the Board of Directors of the Bank as of the
date hereof to be appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent in Mr.
Morellos stead. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Receiving Bank shall
cause its Board of Directors to be expanded by two members and shall appoint
Messrs. Capizola and DiLazzero to fill the vacancies on the Receiving Banks
Board of Directors created by such increase. In connection with the foregoing,
Mr. Capizola will be appointed to the Executive Committee of the Receiving
Bank. If either Mr. Capizola or Mr. DiLazzero do not become a director of the
Receiving Bank because of death, disability or otherwise, Parent agrees, after
consultation with Messrs. Morello, Capizola and DiLazzero, as appropriate, to

ARTICLE IX



TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT



9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, by the
shareholders of both the Bank and SPB:



(a) by mutual consent of the Bank and Parent in a written instrument, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of
the members of its entire Board of Directors;



(b) by either Parent or the Bank upon written notice to the other party (i)
30 days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or
recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite
Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such denial or
withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed
with the applicable Governmental Entity (provided, however, that no party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein) or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger;



(c) by either Parent or the Bank if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before September 30, 2006, unless the failure of the Closing
to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;



(d) by either Parent or the Bank (provided that it shall not be in material
breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.4), if approval of the
shareholders of the Bank required for the consummation of the Merger shall not
have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain, after the use of all
reasonable efforts, the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;



 

(e) by either Parent or the Bank (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement  



 

38  contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(e) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all
other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation not
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in
the case of a breach of representation or warranty by the Bank) or Section
8.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by Parent);



(f) by either Parent or the Bank (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from
the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the Closing; or



(g) by the Bank at any time during the two-day period following
the Determination Date (as defined in Section 1.4 hereof), if both of the
following conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied:



(1) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less than the
product of 0.800 and the Starting Price; and



(2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below)
and subtracting 0.200 from such quotient (such number being referred to herein
as the "Index Ratio");



subject to the following. If the Bank elects to exercise its termination right
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written
notice to Parent; provided that such notice of election to terminate may be
withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned two-day period. During the
period commencing with its receipt of such notice and ending at the Effective
Time, Parent shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio and/or
the Per Share Cash Consideration in a manner such, and to the extent required,
so that the condition set forth in either clause (1) or (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist; provided, however, that the Per Share Cash Consideration
shall not be increased in a manner that would cause the failure of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(e) or 8.3(d) hereof.



For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:



the Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased
so that the Per Share Consideration (calculated by using the Average Closing
Price, as provided in the definition of "Per Share Consideration") after such
increase is not less than 86% of the Per Share Consideration calculated by
using the Starting Price in lieu of the Average Closing Price.



 

39 For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:



the Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased
so that the Adjusted Parent Ratio is not less than the Index Ratio.



If Parent makes this election, within such period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Bank of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio and/or
Per Share Cash Consideration, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio and/or Per Share Cash
Consideration, and derivatively the Per Share Stock Consideration and/or Total
Cash Amount, shall have been so modified), and any references in this
Agreement to "Exchange Ratio," "Per Share Cash Consideration," "Per Share
Stock Consideration" and "Total Cash Amount" shall thereafter be deemed to
refer to the Exchange Ratio, Per Share Cash Consideration, Per Share Stock
Consideration and Total Cash Amount after giving effect to any adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 9.1(g). For purposes of this Section 9.1(g), the
following terms shall have the meanings indicated:



"Adjusted Parent Ratio" means the number obtained by dividing (x) the sum of
(A) the Average Closing Price plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the
aggregate increase in transaction value resulting from an increase in the
Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration by the total number of
shares of Bank Common Stock outstanding multiplied by the initial Exchange
Ratio and the percentage offered as stock (70%), on the Determination Date, by
(y) the Starting Price. 



"Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale prices
per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ/NMS (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually
agreed upon authoritative source) for the twenty consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the Determination Date (as defined in Section 1.4(a)
hereof).



"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank
Index.



"Per Share Consideration" means the sum of (i) 70% of the product of the Per
Share Stock Consideration times the Average Closing Price plus (ii) 30% of
the Per Share Cash Consideration.



"Starting Date" means the trading day on the NASDAQ/NMS preceding the day on
which the parties publicly announce the signing of this Agreement.



"Starting Price" means $24.00.



If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices
for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g).



 

40 (h) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Bank shall have withdrawn
or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal, or (ii) prior to acceptance for payment of the Bank Common Stock any
Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other
than Principal Shareholders, Parent or its Subsidiaries) shall have become the
beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
of at least 20% of the outstanding Bank Common Stock.



9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Bank as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b), 7.3(e),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement. 



9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of this
Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby, by
the shareholders of either the Bank or SPB; provided, however, that after any
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Banks
shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders,
any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form
of the consideration to be delivered to the Bank shareholders hereunder other
than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.



9.4  _Extensions; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.
