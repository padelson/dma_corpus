to Seller for Sellers review, a copy of the Form 8594 and any required
exhibits thereto (the "Asset Acquisition Statement") allocating the Purchase
Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for income Tax purposes)
among the Companys assets and shall prepare and deliver to Seller, from time
to time, for Sellers review, revised copes of the Asset Acquisition Statement
so as to reflect any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement that need
updating (including purchase price adjustments, if any). Within 30 days of
delivery of the Asset Acquisition Statement, as the case may be, Seller shall
review such statements; and if Seller agrees on the allocation of the Purchase
Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for income Tax purposes)
(which shall be evidenced by an Asset Acquisition Statement signed by each of
Buyer and Seller), Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates shall file
all Tax Returns and information reports in a manner consistent with such
agreed allocation and shall take no position inconsistent therewith. In the
event that Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on such allocation within 30
days after the delivery of the Asset Acquisition Statement, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement. In the event that the parties
cannot agree on the allocation as set forth in such Asset Acquisition
Statement, then none of Buyer or Seller or any of their Affiliates shall be
required pursuant hereto to file any Tax Returns or otherwise take any
position consistent with such allocation. In the event that Buyer or Seller is
unable to agree on the allocation of the final purchase price, then each party
will in any event file a Form 8594. For purposes of the preceding, the
parties intend that the issue price of the Second Lien Credit Agreement shall
be equal to the face amount of the Second Lien Credit Agreement after the
Write-Down; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the assumed liabilities
for tax purposes with respect to the Indebtedness will generally be taken into
account as the amount of the adjusted issue price of such liabilities and
shall not take into account accrued interest that has not been deducted).

Section 3.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
complete list of:

bonus, profits units, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance contracts or
agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which
are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of

 


  

 

16

  

 



 

its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has or could have any obligation; and

 

(ii)

 

all Contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for
compensation to such employee, officer or director, including any Contracts
relating in any way to a sale of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Plans_ ").

 

(b)

 

Each Plan referred to in Section 3.12(a) is in writing. Seller has furnished
to Buyer a true and complete copy of each such Plan and has delivered to Buyer
a true and complete copy of each material document, if any, prepared in
connection with each such Plan, including (i) a true and complete copy of each
trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description and
summary of material modifications thereto, (iii) the two most recently filed
Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 5500s, (iv) the most recently
received IRS determination or opinion letter for each such Plan, and (v) the
most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement in connection
with each such Plan.

 

(c)

 

The Company has no direct or contingent liability with respect to any plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full. None of the
Plans is subject to Section 412 or 430 of the Code or is a multiemployer plan
within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer
Plan_ ") or a single employer pension plan within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could
incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "). None of such Plans provides for or promises retiree medical,
disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d)

 

Each Plan has been operated in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it and is not in any material respect
in default under or in violation under any Plan, nor does Seller have any
Knowledge of any such default or violation by any other party to any Plan. No
Action is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller or the Company, threatened
with respect to any Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
course, and no fact or event exists that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such Action. Each of the Plans is maintained in the United States
and is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof.

 

(e)

 

Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or Section
401(k) of the Code has received a timely favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to such Plan for
which determination letters are currently available that such Plan is so
qualified. No fact or event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of
any such trust, in each case that could not be corrected without material
liability.

 


  

 

17

  

 



 

(f)

 

There has not been any non-exempt prohibited transaction, within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Plan.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA that has not been
satisfied in full, other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course, including any liability
in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee
benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.

 

(g)

 

All material contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with
respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates.

 

(h)

 

There are no Actions or claims (other than routine claims for benefits)
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller or the Company, threatened with respect
to any Plan or any related trust or other funding medium thereunder or with
respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate as the sponsor or fiduciary
thereof or with respect to any other fiduciary thereof.

 

(i)

 

No Plan or any related trust or other funding medium thereunder or any
fiduciary thereof is, to the Knowledge of Seller or the Company, the subject
of an audit, investigation or examination by any Governmental Authority.

 

(j)

 

No "reportable event," as such term is used in Section 4043 of ERISA,
"accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is used in Section 412 or 4971
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or application for or receipt of a waiver
from the IRS of any minimum funding requirement under Section 412 of the Code
has occurred with respect to any Plan in the past five years.

 

(k)

 

The Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not maintain any Plan that is a "group
health plan," as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, which
has not been administered and operated in all material respects in compliance
with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA, Section 4980B(b) of
the Code and the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1986.

 

(l)

 

Each Plan that is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code has
complied in form and operation with the requirements of Section 409A of the

ARTICLE VI 
 TAX MATTERS

 

Section 6.1

 

 _Tax Returns._

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed after
the Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax Returns are to be filed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer
shall provide Seller with copies of completed drafts of such Tax Returns no
later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (including
applicable extensions) for Sellers review and approval. In the event that the
Company or any Subsidiary is treated as a pass-through entity other than a
disregarded entity for US federal income tax or for state income tax purpose
for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall make any revisions to such Tax Returns requested by Seller
that relate to the Tax liability of Seller or a direct or indirect owner of an
interest in Seller. Except as provided herein, Buyer shall be responsible for
all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries due and payable with respect to
such Company and Subsidiary Tax Returns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
for the avoidance of doubt, (i) Buyer shall not be required to pay or have any
liability for any Taxes imposed on a direct or indirect owner of an interest
in Seller on a pass-through basis as a result of its ownership of Seller and
(ii) Buyer shall not be responsible or liable for or required to pay for any
withholding Taxes imposed on the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries
resulting from the Sellers, the Companys or its Subsidiaries status as a
pass-through entity that relate to income Taxes of any indirect owner of an
interest in Seller (including but not limited to any withholding Taxes due as
a result of the non-resident status of a direct or indirect owner of Seller).

 

(b)

 

Seller and Buyer shall treat the Closing as a sale by Seller of the assets of
the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for all corresponding
state income tax purposes. Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns of Seller. Pursuant to Section 6.4 Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall provide Seller with such information and materials as it
needs to prepare such Tax Returns.

 

(c)

 

Buyer on the one hand and Seller on the other hand shall each be responsible
for 50% of any and all excise, sales, use, stamp, transfer, documentary,
filing, recordation, value added Taxes and other similar Taxes and fees, if
any, that are actually incurred as a result of the purchase and sale of the
Interests, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect
thereto (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer and Seller agree to
cooperate in the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes..

 

(d)

 

Not less than 60 days prior to the due date for the filing of any Tax Return
(taking into account applicable extensions) for which the other party or
parties have any liability, the filing party shall deliver a copy of such Tax
Return to the other party or parties for their review and comment. The other
party or parties shall pay directly to the

 


  

 

39

  

 



 

filing party or parties their portion of the Taxes due thereon (as determined
pursuant to this Article VI) no later than five days prior to the due date for
the filing of such Tax Return.

 

Section 6.2

 

 _Tax Indemnity._

 

(a)

 

Except as set forth herein, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay
and be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any
direct or indirect owner of an interest in Seller from and against any and all
(i) Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) Taxes of the Seller
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, that Seller
agrees to reimburse Buyer for the amount of any Taxes of Seller with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period paid or borne by Buyer pursuant to this Section
6.2(a) and for the expenses of Sellers for which indemnification is provided
in Sections 6.4(a) and 6.5(c), in a cumulative amount not to exceed
$3,000,000. This obligation of Seller to reimburse Buyer shall terminate upon
the earlier of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation or upon
the repayment in full of the Amended and Restated Second Lien Credit Agreement
(as defined in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement) and any reimbursement
payments made by Seller pursuant to this obligation shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the forgoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (i) Buyer shall
not be required to pay or have any liability for any Taxes of Seller with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period or Taxes imposed on a direct or indirect
owner of an interest in Seller on a pass-through basis as a result of its
ownership of Seller and (iii) Buyer shall not be responsible or liable for or
required to indemnify for any withholding Taxes imposed on Seller, the Company
and its Subsidiaries resulting from Seller, the Companys or its Subsidiaries
status as a pass-through entity that relate to income Taxes of Seller or any
indirect owner of an interest in Seller (including but not limited to any
withholding Taxes due as a result of the non-resident status of a direct or
indirect owner of Seller). Furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall not indemnify and shall not be required to pay for any Taxes imposed on
a direct or indirect owner of an interest in Seller on a pass through basis as
a result of its ownership of Seller.

 

(b)

 

Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any (i) Taxes of the Seller with respect to a Post-Closing
Tax Period and (ii) withholding of Taxes imposed on the Company and its
Subsidiaries resulting from the Companys or its Subsidiaries status as a
pass-through entity that relate to income Taxes of Seller or any indirect
owner of an interest in Seller (including but not limited to any withholding
Taxes due as a result of the non-resident status of a direct or indirect owner
of Seller). 

 

(c)

 

For purposes of this Article VI, in determining whether a Tax Return filing
obligation or any Tax liability imposed by a Governmental Authority with
respect to any specific type of Tax is an obligation or liability of Seller on
the one hand, or the Company and its Subsidiaries on the other hand, the Tax
Returns shall be filed and Tax liabilities shall be determined in accordance
with past practice of Seller, the Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may
be. For the avoidance of doubt, such past practice has been that all non
income taxes imposed as a result of the operations and assets of the Company

 


  

 

40

  

 



 

and its subsidiaries (e.g., sales and use, employment and property taxes) have
been filed and paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.3

 

 _Tax Allocation_. For purposes of this Article VI, Taxes of a Straddle Period
shall be apportioned between the taxable periods or portions thereof ending on
or prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), on the one hand,
and the taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date
(the "Post-Closing Tax Period"), on the other hand. The amount of any Taxes
based on or measured by income, gain, or receipts or other similar items shall
be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period on a closing-of-the-books basis. The amount of other Taxes shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
as follows: (i) in the case of any Tax imposed in respect of property and that
applies ratably to a Straddle Period, the amount of any such Tax allocable to
a portion of the Straddle Period shall be the total amount of such Tax for the
period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total number of days in such portion of such Straddle Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period and
(ii) in the case of sales, valued-added, withholding and similar transaction-
based Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) such Taxes shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period in which the relevant transaction occurred.

 

Section 6.4

 

 _Tax Cooperation._

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared drafts of all Tax Returns of
Seller for all taxable periods ending on, prior to or including the Closing
Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice and Buyer shall cooperate and consult with Seller in connection with
the preparation of such Tax Returns. Seller shall provide information to
Buyer with respect to any activities or operations of Seller (if any) with
respect to portions of periods beginning on or after the Closing Date. Such
drafts shall be delivered to Seller no less than sixty days prior to the due
date of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall provide such additional information,
calculations and material as shall be reasonably requested in connection with
such Tax Returns and shall cooperate and assist Seller as necessary for Seller
and Sellers accountants to finalize such draft Tax Returns. Buyer shall
prepare such Tax Returns using its internal tax personnel and Seller shall
hire any outside accountants required to finalize such Tax Returns. Sellers
shall be liable for and shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries)in accordance with and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 6.1(a), for all costs incurred by such
outside accountants and for any reasonable third-party costs incurred by Buyer
in connection with Buyers obligations under this Section 6.4(a).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, Seller will be responsible for the
information contained in the final Tax Returns, and Buyer shall have no
liability for or any indemnification obligation to Seller or Sellers direct
or indirect owners with respect to such Tax Returns except for fraud, willful
misconduct and gross negligence; provided that Buyer shall be liable for
indemnification of Taxes of the Seller for Pre-Closing Periods pursuant to
Section 6.2.

 

(b)

 

After the Closing Date, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees,
agents,

 


  

 

41

  

 



 

auditors and representatives to cooperate as reasonably requested, in
connection with the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns prepared and
filed pursuant to this Article VI and with respect to any Tax Claim. The
Company shall retain all Tax records related to the operations of the Company
and Tax Returns completed by Seller. Buyer and Seller recognize that Seller
may need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain
accounting and Tax records and information held by the Company to the extent
such records and information pertain to events occurring on or before the
Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company, its affiliates and successors to (1)
retain and maintain such records and information until one year after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (2) allow Seller (and
agents and representatives of Seller) to inspect, review and make copies of
such records and information as Seller or any agent and representative of
Seller may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, provided that
Seller or Seller Representative shall reimburse Buyer for all out of pocket
costs in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request,
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 

Section 6.5

 

 _Tax Claims._

 

(a)

 

If notice of any Action with respect to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Seller,
the Company or any Subsidiary is received by Buyer or an Affiliate that may
give rise to a liability for Taxes upon, or be reflected on the Tax Returns

Seller in writing of such Tax Claim. If Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
receives a Tax Claim the notified party shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable, notify Buyer in writing of such Company Tax Claim.

relieve any party of its obligations under this Article VI, except to the
extent that the other Party is prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b)

 

Buyer shall represent the interest of the Seller and Company and its
Subsidiaries in any Tax Claim; _provided_ that with respect to any Tax Claim
that relates to the liability for Taxes upon the Seller or any direct or

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the
forgoing, (x) with respect to a Tax Claim that relates solely to Seller or any
direct or indirect owner of an interest in Seller and for which only any
direct or indirect owners of an interest in Seller is liable on a pass through
basis, Seller shall be permitted at its option to represent the interest of
Seller and the direct or indirect owner of an interest in Seller provided that
Buyer may participate at its own expense in all aspects of such Tax Claim

 


  

 

42

(b) shall provide Buyer with copies of all correspondence, notices and other

pass through basis and the Company or Seller is liable on an entity basis,
Seller shall be permitted at its option to represent the interest of Seller
and the direct or indirect owner of an interest in Seller at its own expense
in all aspects of such Tax Claim, provided that Buyer may take control at its
own expense of all aspects of such Tax Claim that relate to entity level
Taxes, and each Party (a) shall keep the other Party informed with respect to
such Tax Claim; and (b) shall provide the other Party with copies of all
correspondence, notices and other written materials related to such Tax Claim
received from any Governmental Authority and shall keep the other Party
informed on significant developments and (c) neither party shall settle such
Tax Claim without consent of the other Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

 

(c)

 

With respect to any Tax Claim involving Seller, Buyer and Seller shall (i)
cooperate with each other in all aspects of such Tax Claim and (ii) make all
records and other materials of the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to such claim available to each other. Buyer shall, at Sellers,
request and to the extent it does not conflict with Buyers reasonable
position with respect to such Tax Claim, make such records available to the
applicable Governmental Authority and communicate with the applicable
Governmental Authority on behalf of Seller regarding positions taken on the
Tax Returns at issue. In accordance with and subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 6.1(a), Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) harmless from any
third-party costs associated with the performance of its obligations under
this Section 6.5(c) that relate to Tax Returns of Seller.

interests of the members of Seller and shall be responsible for any consent
and notification provisions under Article VI. In no event shall Buyer, the
Company or its Subsidiaries be liable to Seller or its direct, or indirect
