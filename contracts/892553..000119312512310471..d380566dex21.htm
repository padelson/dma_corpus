powers, franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

_(b)_ _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be amended and restated as of the
Effective Time to be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the
Company) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 



5  of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
herein or by applicable Law.

 

 _(c)_ _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_ __. __At the
Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub, as constituted immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and the officers set forth in Section 1.3(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule will be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected
or appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

 _Section 1.4_ _Conversion of Securities_.

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any Shareholder, the following
shall occur:

 

 _(a)_ Each share of Company Common Stock that is held in the treasury of the
Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company immediately before the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and no payment or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

_(b)_ Each share of common stock of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

_(c)_ Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 1.4(e), each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled
in accordance with Section 1.4(a)) will be cancelled and extinguished and be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, as
specified in this Section 1.4(c). All such shares of Company Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock which
immediately prior to the Effective Time were represented by a certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to those shares,
except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with the provisions of Section 1.5 and Section 8.9(e).

_(d)_ If there is a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital
stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to shares of Company Common Stock occurring
after the date of this Agreement and before the Effective Time, all references
in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series of
Company Common Stock affected thereby, and all calculations that are based
upon numbers of shares of any such class or series (or trading prices
therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as

 



6  contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

 

 _(e)_ Notwithstanding Section 1.4(c), shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the NYBCL shall not be converted into the Per Share
Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted

to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands prior to the Effective Time and the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands. All Shareholders who demand and perfect
appraisal rights for their shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the NYBCL are referred to herein as the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ ".

_Section 1.5_ _Payment; Exchange of Certificates_.

 

 _(a)_ _Company Indebtedness_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the Persons
set forth in Schedule 1.5(a) the Company Indebtedness (other than the

pursuant to Section 1.2(a)(5)(ii).

_(b)_ _Escrow Funds; Shareholders  Representative Amount_. 

_(1)_ Parent shall cause a portion of the Purchase Price equal to $5,000,000

the form of Exhibit C (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, the
Escrow Agent and the Representative.

_(2)_ Parent shall also cause a portion of the Purchase Price equal to
$1,000,000 (the " _280G Escrow Amount_ " and, as may be decreased from time to

7  Representative in the performance of Representatives duties in accordance

of transmittal substantially in the form of Exhibit D (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (2) instructions for use in surrendering Certificates to
Parent in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock. Upon the later of (1) the Closing or
(2) the submission to the Company of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, a
Certificate, any required Form W-9 or Form W-8 and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by Parent (the " _Letter of Transmittal Documents_ "),
the holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, subject to the next sentence, the Per Share
Merger Consideration into which the shares formerly represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted in accordance with Section 1.4. Parent
shall promptly pay to such holder the aggregate Per Share Closing
Consideration payable with respect to such shares on receipt of the applicable
Letter of Transmittal Documents. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.5(c), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate. If any transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock has not been registered in the
Companys transfer records, payment may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the new
registration instructions in the Letter of Transmittal are completed in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the Person requesting such transfer or

pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for payment as provided in this
Article 1, except as otherwise provided by Law.

 



8 _(e)_ _No Liability._ None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any Person with respect to any cash delivered to a public official
in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
If any amounts payable in accordance with this Article 1 would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
amounts, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to the
date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of
any Governmental Authority, shall become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

 _(f)_ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and executed
indemnification agreement and, if required by Parent, to post a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, in each case as reasonably requested
by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of any of them with respect to such
Certificate.

_(g)_ _Tax Withholding._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
in accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent reasonably believes are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Tax Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

 

 _(h)_ _Change in Control Payments._ Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Change in Control Payments promptly following the
Closing, provided that, any such payments owing under the SAR Plan (the " _SAR
Payment_ ") shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section
7.1(b)(2) of the SAR Plan; provided further, however, that Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay the SAR Payments owing under the SAR Plan in
a single lump sum promptly after the Closing Date (but no later than the time
periods set forth in Section 7.1(b)(2) of the SAR Plan) to those employees
who sign and deliver to the Company a receipt and release in the form attached

its properties and carry on its business as presently conducted. The
outstanding shares of capital stock or equity interests of the Company
Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and were not

representation is being made herein by the Company or the Company Subsidiary
with respect to any such Permit, Order, registration, filing, declaration or

benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person and their
respective heirs, legal

applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Parent or its Affiliates lists
securities, provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party
intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other party with
respect to the text thereof. To the extent that any such disclosure filing
(required by __

 



44  applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which Ultimate Parent
or its Affiliates list securities) will include a copy of this Agreement,
either (i) the Disclosure Schedule will not be included with the copy of this

the extent available for all information included in the Disclosure Schedule.

receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the Transactions (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that no
payment received by, or benefit provided to, such "disqualified individual"
would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code if the
Shareholders approve the payment by a vote that complies with Section
280(b)(5)(B) of the Code. The Company shall (i) at least five (5) Business
Days prior to providing (A) the applicable disqualified individuals with any
required waivers, consents or agreements and (B) the applicable Shareholders

Parties referred to herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the

notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to

Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of the Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 

 _(b)_ If a Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof. Subject to the last sentence
of this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnifying Party may also assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party;
provided, however, that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by
the Indemnified Party and the reasonable attorneys fees of the Indemnifying
Party in connection therewith shall reduce the amount recoverable under the
Escrow Fund by any Parent Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at the Indemnified Partys expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense.

and expenses of such counsel shall constitute Damages for purposes of this
Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 8.4, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such
Third Party Claim) if (1) the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or
other equitable relief or relief other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party, (2) the Indemnifying Party cannot demonstrate that it has
sufficient financial resources to satisfy the full amount of monetary damages
sought in the Third Party Claim, (3) the Third Party Claim includes criminal
charges against the Indemnified Party or alleges conduct or acts that could
reasonably result in criminal charges against the Indemnified Party, or (4)

to any and all claims for indemnification made under this Article 8 (excluding
any claims made under Section 8.1(a)(7)) shall be limited, individually and in
the aggregate, to the Escrow Fund (the " _Cap_ "). The amount of Damages that
may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to any and all
claims for indemnification made under Section 8.1(a)(7) shall be limited,
individually and in the aggregate, first to the 280G Escrow Fund _plus_ , to
the extent such claims exceed the 280G Escrow Fund, the Escrow Fund. If the
Merger is consummated, the recovery by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Article 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (other than with
respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are available) with respect to
any and all claims relating to or arising in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions, except for Damages resulting in the case of fraud.

 



52 _(b)_ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification against
Damages pursuant to this Article 8 (excluding any claims made under Sections
8.1(a)(7), (8) and (9)) unless the aggregate Damages related to all such
Damages are greater than $250,000 (" _Deductible_ "), in which case the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall, subject to Section 8.6(a), be entitled to
indemnification for all Damages from the first dollar without regard to such
amount.

 

 _(c)_ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any claim
for indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Party to be enforceable must be
asserted by delivery of written notice of such claim in accordance with the
requirements of this Article 8 prior to the thirty-six (36) month anniversary
of the Closing Date, after which any and all additional claims by the Parent
Indemnified Parties for indemnification under this Article 8 shall be void and
of no force and effect.

_Section 8.7 Certain Other Restrictions on Indemnification._

_(a)_ Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,

Agreement with respect to any Damages to the extent (and only to the extent)
such Damages are duplicative of Damages that have previously been recovered
under this Article 8.

_(b)_ Parent and the Representative agree to treat any indemnification
payments received pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 8.8 Calculation and Mitigation of Damages._

Article 8 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified
Party under insurance policies or other collateral sources with respect to
such Damages in excess of the sum of (1) reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and
expenses relating to collection under such policies or other collateral
sources, and (2) the deductible associated therewith to the extent actually
paid. In the event the Indemnified Parties receive any recovery, the amount of
such recovery shall be applied _first_ , to reimburse the Indemnified Parties
for any Damages incurred in excess of the payments made by the
Indemnifying Parties in respect of claims pursuant to this Article 8,
_second_ , to refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Parties in respect
of indemnification claims pursuant to this Article 8 which would not have been
so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment (provided that
if such payments were made out of the Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund is still
in effect, such amounts shall be returned to the Escrow Fund), and _third_ ,
any remainder to the Indemnified Parties. 

_Section 8.9 Representative._

_(a)_ The Representative shall serve as representative of the Shareholders
(with respect to their interest in the Escrow Amounts) with full power and
authority to take all actions under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
relating to claims for indemnification asserted by any Parent Indemnified
Party hereunder. Such power and authority shall include, without limitation,
the power and authority (1) to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise

 



53  handle all claims for indemnification made by any Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to Article 8 hereof, (2) to direct the payment of claims from the
Escrow Fund and/or the 280G Escrow Fund and to use the Shareholders
Representative Amount to do so as determined by the Representative, and (3) to
do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which the Representative
is permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The Shareholders will be bound by all actions taken by the
Representative in connection with claims for indemnification asserted by
Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement, and Parent shall be entitled
to rely on any notice or communication to or by, or decision, action, failure
to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of, the Representative. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of the Representative will constitute a decision of all of the
Shareholders with respect to their interest in the Escrow Amounts, and will
be final, binding and conclusive upon each Shareholder, and Parent may rely
upon any such decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of the
Representative as being that of each and every Shareholder. Parent and the
Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Shareholder for any
acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Representative.

_(b)_ Any expenses or liabilities incurred by the Representative in connection
with the performance of its duties in such capacity under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement shall be reimbursed to the Representative from the
Shareholders Representative Amount. Without limiting in any way the
provisions of this Section 8.9(b), at such time as the Shareholders
Representative Amount has been exhausted in addition to any other rights or
remedies, the Representative may, upon prior or contemporaneous written
notice, offset any amounts determined by it to be owed to the Representative
against any portion of the Escrow Amounts to be paid to the Shareholders on a
pro rata basis.

_(c)_ In the event of a vacancy in the position of Representative (or
resignation, refusal or incapability of the Representative to serve), holders
of a majority in interest of the cash then in the Escrow Fund shall appoint a
new Representative by written consent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement within 10 Business Days after such vacancy and immediately
thereafter send to Parent notice and a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Representative signed by such holders of a majority in
interest of the cash then in the Escrow Fund; provided, however, that if the
vacancy continues for more than 10 Business Days, Parent may appoint a
successor Representative who will thereafter be the Representative hereunder
and subject hereto unless and until such time as a replacement Representative
is appointed by such holders of a majority in interest of the cash then in the
Escrow Fund. If there is not a Representative at any time, any obligation to
provide notice to the Representative will be deemed satisfied if such notice
is delivered to each of the Shareholders, other than the Dissenting
Shareholders, at their addresses last known to Parent, which will be
the address set forth in the Spreadsheet unless Representative provides
notice to Parent of a different address in the manner described in Section
9.3. Any successor Representative appointed by the holders of a majority
interest of the cash then in the Escrow Fund (or by Parent as provided above)
must have been a securityholder of the Company prior to the Effective Time or,
in the case of a securityholder that is an entity, a partner, employee or 

 



54  affiliate of a securityholder of the Company prior to the Effective Time, or
must be a professional stockholder representative firm.

 

 _(d)_ The Representative shall have reasonable access to information about
the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the Companys
former officers and employees who are employed by Parent or its Affiliates for
purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder. The
Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or disclose the terms
of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or about Parent, Surviving
Corporation, or any Parent Indemnified Party to anyone (except to the
Shareholders or the Representatives employees, attorneys, accountants,
financial advisors or authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in
each case who agree to treat such information confidentially). The
Representative shall enter into a separate confidentiality agreement (in form
and content reasonably acceptable to Parent) prior to being provided access
to such information if requested by Parent.

_(e)_ The Representative shall distribute based on their respective Pro Rata
Portions to the Shareholders, other than the Dissenting Shareholders, any
portion of (i) the Escrow Fund and/or 280G Escrow Fund that becomes available
for distribution in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
(ii) the Shareholders Representative Amount that is available for
distribution upon the termination of the Escrow Agreement (the " _Per Share
Post-Closing Consideration_ ").

 

 _(f)_ By its signature to this Agreement, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing and the additional condition set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 8.9(f), the initial Representative hereby accepts the appointment
contained in this Agreement, as confirmed and extended by this Agreement, and
agrees to act as the Representative and to discharge the duties
and responsibilities of the Representative pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Representatives agreement to serve in such capacity shall not
establish a fiduciary relationship between Representative and any other party
(including the Shareholders or the Parent Indemnified Parties).
Representative shall not be personally liable to any party for any action
taken in such capacity except to the extent arising as a result of
Representatives willful misconduct or gross negligence; and Representative
shall in no event be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits) even if Representative
has been advised of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
Representative undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein. The duties and responsibilities of the Representative hereunder
shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, and
no further duties or responsibilities shall be implied. The Representative
shall not have any liability under nor duty to inquire into the terms and
provisions of any agreement or instructions, other than outlined in this
Agreement. The Representative may rely, and shall not be liable for acting or
refraining from acting, upon any written notice, instruction or request
furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Representative shall
be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or
content of any such document. The Representative may perform its duties
hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys and may consult with
counsel and accountants to be selected and retained by it. The Representative
shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it
in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel or accountants. 

 



55  None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall require the
Representative to use or advance its own funds in the performance of any of
its duties or the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder.
