purposes on the 45th day after the Delivery Date unless Buyer delivers to
Seller a written notice of its disagreement executed by Buyer (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") prior to such date specifying in reasonable detail the
nature of Buyer\'s objections to the Closing Statement. To be assertable in a
Notice of Disagreement, an objection by Buyer with respect to any individual
matter relating to the Closing Statement must assert that the Closing
Statement was not prepared in accordance with the terms of Section 3.2(b) with
respect to such matter and relate to an adjustment equal to or greater than
$100,000. Buyer hereby waives the right to assert any objection with respect
to the Closing Statement that is not asserted in a Notice of Disagreement
delivered to Seller within 45 days after the Delivery Date. If a Notice of
Disagreement is delivered to Seller within such 45 day period, then the
Closing Statement (as adjusted, if necessary) will be deemed to be the Final
Closing Statement for all purposes on the earlier of (x) the date Seller and
Buyer resolve in writing all differences they have with respect to the Closing
Statement or (y) the date the disputed matters are resolved in writing by the
Unaffiliated Firm. In the event that disputed matters are resolved by the
Unaffiliated Firm (as set forth below), the Final Closing Statement will
consist of the applicable amounts from the Closing Statement (or amounts
otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer) as to items that have not
been submitted for resolution to the Unaffiliated Firm, and the amounts
determined by the Unaffiliated Firm as to items that were submitted for
resolution by the Unaffiliated Firm.

(d) During the 30 day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Seller and Buyer will seek in
good faith to resolve any differences they may have with respect to matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of the Resolution
Period, Seller and Buyer have not reached agreement on such matters, (i)
Seller will have the right, within 30 days after the end of the Resolution
Period, to advise Buyer in writing of Seller\'s position with respect to each
of Buyers proposed adjustments that are in dispute (" _Seller s Letter_")
and (ii) Buyer will have the right, within 30 days after the end of the
Resolution Period, to advise Seller in writing of Buyers position with
respect to each of Buyers proposed adjustments that are in dispute (" _Buyer
s Letter_"). During the Resolution Period, and, if at the end thereof, Seller
and Buyer have not reached agreement on all matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement, for an additional 30 days, each party shall provide the other
party and its Representatives with reasonable access, following reasonable
notice, to books, records and relevant personnel relating to the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement; provided that such
access shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal work duties of any
such personnel. Promptly following the end of the 30 day period after the
Resolution Period



 

5 (or, if earlier, the later of (x) the date on which Seller delivers Sellers
Letter to Buyer and (y) the date on which Buyer delivers Buyers Letter to
Seller), Seller and Buyer will jointly engage a single arbitrator from the
firm of KPMG LLP (or, if a representative of KPMG LLP is unable or unwilling
to act in such capacity, a single arbitrator from the firm of Grant Thornton
LLP) (the " _Unaffiliated Firm_ ") to resolve the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute with respect to the Closing
Statement by arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.2(d). In connection with such engagement, Buyer and Seller will each
execute, if requested by the Unaffiliated Firm, a reasonable engagement letter
including customary indemnities. Promptly after such engagement of the
Unaffiliated Firm, Seller or Buyer will provide the Unaffiliated Firm with a
copy of this Agreement, the Closing Statement, the Notice of Disagreement,
Seller\'s Letter and Buyer\'s Letter. The Unaffiliated Firm will have
the authority to request in writing such additional written submissions from
Seller or Buyer as it deems appropriate; provided that a copy of any such
submission will be provided to the other party at the same time as it is
provided to the Unaffiliated Firm. Seller and Buyer will not make (or permit
any of their Affiliates to make) any additional submission to the Unaffiliated
Firm except pursuant to such a written request by the Unaffiliated Firm.
Seller and Buyer will not communicate (or permit any of their Affiliates to
communicate) with the Unaffiliated Firm without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to participate in such communication with the
Unaffiliated Firm (other than with respect to written submissions in
response to the written request of the Unaffiliated Firm). The Unaffiliated
Firm will have 45 days to review the documents provided to it pursuant to this
Section 3.2(d). Within such 45 day period, the Unaffiliated Firm will furnish
simultaneously to Seller and Buyer its written determination with respect to
each of the adjustments in dispute submitted to it for resolution. The
Unaffiliated Firm will resolve the differences regarding the Closing Statement
based solely on the information provided to the Unaffiliated Firm by Seller
and Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and not independent
review). The Unaffiliated Firm\'s authority will be limited to resolving
disputes with respect to whether the Closing Statement was prepared
in accordance with the terms of Section 3.2(b) with respect to the individual
items on the Closing Statement in dispute specified in the Notice of
Disagreement (it being understood that the Unaffiliated Firm will have no
authority to make any adjustments to any financial statements or amounts
other than amounts set forth on the Closing Statement that are in dispute). In
resolving any disputed item, the Unaffiliated Firm may not assign a value to
such item greater than the greatest value for such item asserted by Seller or
Buyer or less than the smallest value for such item asserted by Seller or
Buyer.

(e) The decision of the Unaffiliated Firm will be, for all purposes,
conclusive, non-appealable, final and binding upon Seller and Buyer. Such
decision will be subject to specific performance pursuant to Section 15.17,
and judgment may also be entered thereon as an arbitration award pursuant to
the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, in any court of competent
jurisdiction (subject to Section 15.11). The fees of the Unaffiliated Firm
will be borne by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in
the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items lost by Seller,
on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, bears to the total dollar amount
in dispute resolved by the Unaffiliated Firm. Each party will bear the fees,
costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other expenses in
connection with matters contemplated by this Section 3.2.



 

6 SECTION 3.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. Upon the Closing Statement being deemed
the Final Closing Statement in accordance with Section 3.2, the Purchase
Price will be adjusted, up or down, as follows:

(a) if the remainder (the " _Net Working Capital_ ") of (A) the amount of
current assets on the Final Closing Statement minus (B) the amount of current
liabilities on the Final Closing Statement is greater than Two Hundred Thirty
Million dollars ($230,000,000), the Purchase Price will be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount by which the Net Working Capital is
greater than Two Hundred Thirty Million dollars ($230,000,000), and Buyer
will, within three business days after the date that the Closing Statement is
deemed to be the Final Closing Statement in accordance with Section 3.2, pay
to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollars to the
Rockwell Ohio Bank Account, an aggregate amount equal to (i) the amount by
which the Purchase Price is so increased and (ii) interest on the amount by
which the Purchase Price is so increased from the Closing Date to the date of
payment (calculated based on actual days elapsed in a 365-day year) at a
fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate from time to time
of Mellon Bank, N.A.; and

(b) if the Net Working Capital is less than Two Hundred Million dollars
($200,000,000), the Purchase Price will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the amount by which the Net Working Capital is less than Two Hundred
Million dollars ($200,000,000), and Seller will, within three business days
after the date that the Closing Statement is deemed to be the Final Closing
Statement in accordance with Section 3.2, pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. dollars to the Buyer Bank Account, an aggregate
amount equal to (i) the amount by which the Purchase Price is so reduced and
(ii) interest on the amount by which the Purchase Price is so reduced from the
Closing Date to the date of payment (calculated based on actual days elapsed
in a 365-day year) at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime interest
rate from time to time of Mellon Bank, N.A.;

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Purchase Price will not be increased or
decreased, and no payments will be made by Seller or Buyer, pursuant to this
Section 3.3 if the Net Working Capital is between Two Hundred Million dollars
($200,000,000) and Two Hundred Thirty Million dollars ($230,000,000).

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 9.1 _Continuation of Employment_. Buyer will (i) cause the Acquired
Companies to continue to employ, commencing as of the Closing Date, each of
the employees of the Acquired Companies who are employed (including those who
are actively employed or on vacation, layoff, leave or short-term disability
or other permitted absence from employment) immediately prior to the Closing
Date, including all such employees covered by the collective bargaining
agreements set forth on Schedule 5.19(a) or entered into by the Acquired
Companies prior to the Effective Time and (ii) offer, or cause one of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to offer, employment, commencing
as of the Closing Date, to each of the employees of Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) set forth on Schedule 9.1 (which Schedule
9.1 will be deemed to be amended to reflect the deletion of any such employees
whose employment terminates prior to the Effective Time and the addition of
any employees of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
who become engaged primarily in the Business with the consent of Buyer (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) between
the date hereof and the Effective Time); provided that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be construed to be a contract of employment for any term
nor the right of any such person to continue in the employ of Buyer or any
Acquired Company in any capacity after the Effective Time. Employees who (i)
continue in such employment with an Acquired Company or (ii) who accept such
an offer of employment by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including an
Acquired Company) are herein referred to as " _Continued Employees_ ". Buyer
will provide or will cause an Acquired Company to provide to each Continued
Employee, commencing as of the Closing Date, (i) a salary or wage level at
least equal to that which such Continued Employee was entitled to from Seller
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) immediately prior to the

bargaining agreements of the Acquired Companies, employee benefits that are
comparable in all material respects to and no less favorable in the aggregate
than the benefits provided by the employee benefit plans maintained by Buyer
for its employees generally, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the terms of any collective
bargaining agreement, applicable law or any other provision of this Agreement,
after the Closing Date, Buyer expressly reserves the right to modify any
salary or wage level of any Continued Employee and to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan or program established or maintained by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates for the benefit of Continued Employees in accordance
with the terms of such plan or program and applicable Law. As of the Closing
Date, Buyer will cause the appropriate Acquired Company to maintain, and Buyer
will perform or cause to be performed all obligations of Seller and its
Affiliates under, the collective bargaining agreements covering



 

49 Continued Employees or former employees of the Acquired Companies and any and
all collateral agreements related thereto, including those affecting all
terms and conditions of employment, subject to Seller\'s obligations under

") will cease to accrue benefits under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan and will
have a fully nonforfeitable right to such Continued Employee\'s benefit
payable at normal retirement age under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan accrued
as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no provision in this
Agreement shall be construed to provide any Continued Employee credit for
purposes of determining eligibility for an early retirement or disability
pension under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute termination of
employment of Continued Employees for purposes of entitlement to distribution
from the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan. None of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies), any retirement plan of Buyer or any trust
thereunder will have or acquire any interest in or right with respect to any
of the assets of, nor be liable to make any contribution to, the Rockwell
U.S. Pension Plan or any trust related thereto, and Seller will retain full
power and authority with respect to the amendment and termination of the
Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan and the investment and disposition of assets held

after the Closing Date, none of Seller or its Affiliates, the Rockwell U.S.
Pension Plan or any trust thereunder will have any Liabilities with respect
to benefits and entitlements of Continued Employees under the Rockwell U.S.
Pension Plan, except with respect to benefits accrued and vested under the
Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to provide any Continued Employee with credit for service with Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) after the Closing Date
for any purpose under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan.

(ii) To the extent required by the terms of any collective bargaining
agreement covering Continued Employees of the Acquired Companies, as of the

Plan_") that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and satisfies all
terms and conditions of the applicable collective bargaining agreements. In
addition, Buyer will, or will cause the appropriate Acquired Company to,
establish a related trust, which will be exempt from taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code. Each Buyer\'s U.S. Pension Plan will credit
each Continued Employee participating therein for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting with all service which had been credited to such
Continued



 

50 Employee for such purposes under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date (excluding any such service which was not counted
under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan by operation of its "break in service"
rules), subject to all terms and conditions of the applicable collective
bargaining agreements. For purposes of this Section 9.2(a)(ii), all
references to the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan will be to the applicable sub-
plan under the Rockwell U.S. Pension Plan and the applicable provisions of the

trust which is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. Buyers
U.S. Savings Plans will comply with all applicable terms of any collective
bargaining agreements covering Continued Employees. Effective as of the

Continued Employee\'s account balances under the applicable Rockwell U.S.
Savings Plan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Rockwell U.S.
Savings Plan and applicable Laws. The consummation of the transactions

permit the rollover of account balances (including any participant loan
account balances related thereto) from the Rockwell U.S. Savings Plans in the

preceding the Closing Date, each Continued Employee will cease to be eligible
to

incidents occurring, before, on or after the Closing Date or (ii) any claim is
made with respect thereto before, on or after the Closing Date.

SECTION 9.10 _Cooperation_. Seller shall furnish to Buyer no later than ten
days after the Closing Date a schedule listing all prior service of employees
that this Article IX requires Buyer to recognize for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and other seniority rights under plans maintained by
Buyer. Buyer and Seller will reasonably cooperate in making all appropriate
filings required by Law, implementing all appropriate communications with
participants, exchanging and sharing appropriate records and taking such other
action as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this
Article IX. In the event sponsorship of any employee benefit plan is retained
by or transferred to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, such cooperation shall include taking any lawful
and reasonable action necessary to ensure that Buyer has the right to amend
or terminate such plan, subject to the terms of the plan, any applicable
collective bargaining agreements and applicable law. Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of its employees, agents and
independent contractors who have served as administrator or fiduciary of any
employee benefit plan sponsored by Seller with respect to the Acquired
Companies to cooperate reasonably and in good faith with any person or entity
who serves as sponsor, administrator or fiduciary of any corresponding
employee benefit plan sponsored or administered for the benefit of Continued
Employees by Buyer following the Closing.

Stephen Environmental Costs and (iii) all Special Indemnity Costs, in each
case set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), actually (and as) paid by any
member of the Buyer Group. The provisions of this Section 12.3(a) are in
addition to, and not in limitation of, the indemnity by Seller in Section
12.1.

(b) Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Group from and
against, and pay or reimburse, as the case may be, the Buyer Group
for, Legacy Site Environmental Costs that exceed, in the aggregate, the sum

(ii) 100% of the aggregate amount of Legacy Site Environmental Costs that are
in excess of $15 million actually (and as) paid by any member of the Buyer
Group (it being understood that Seller shall not be liable to indemnify the
Buyer Group for any Legacy Site



 

63 Environmental Costs unless and until the aggregate amount of Legacy Site
Environmental Costs exceeds $5 million, in which event Seller shall only be
responsible for 50% of that portion of Legacy Site Environmental Costs that
are in excess of $5 million and less than or equal to $15 million and 100% of
Legacy Site Environmental Costs that are in excess of $15 million). The
provisions of this Section 12.3(b) are in addition to, and not in limitation
of, the indemnity by Seller in Section 12.1.

(c) The provisions of this Section 12.3(c) are in addition to, and not in
limitation of, the procedures set forth in Section 12.4 (which shall be deemed
superseded to the extent inconsistent with this Section 12.3(c)). Buyer shall
provide Seller with prompt notice describing in reasonable detail any new
condition or new claim brought to the attention of Buyer that is not disclosed
by Seller in the Schedules hereto in respect of which Damages related to FPE,
Legacy Site Environmental Costs, Orlando Environmental Costs, St. Stephen
Environmental Costs or Special Indemnity Costs are or may be incurred by any
member of the Buyer Group, whether or not Buyer or any other member of
the Buyer Group is entitled to seek indemnification under this Section 12.3;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of any member of the Buyer
Group in notifying Seller will affect Seller\'s obligations under this 12.3,
except to the extent Seller is actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Buyer
shall keep Seller reasonably apprised of the status of and any action or
activity by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) with respect to all such conditions or claims. At such
time as Buyer anticipates that the $5 million monetary threshold in respect of
Legacy Site Environmental Costs set forth in Section 12.3(b) will be exceeded
(and in any event if and when such threshold is exceeded), Buyer shall
provide Seller with prompt notice thereof, and Seller shall have the option to
participate, at its own expense, in the resolution of any conditions or claims
in respect of such Legacy Site Environmental Costs (and Buyer shall consult
with Seller in respect thereof). Until the $15 million monetary threshold in
respect of Legacy Site Environmental Costs set forth in Section 12.3(b) has
been reached, subject to Seller\'s right to participate in accordance with
the preceding sentence, Buyer shall have the obligation to control all matters
in respect of any conditions or claims in respect of which Legacy Site
Environmental Costs have been or may be incurred and the resolution
thereof, including control of any negotiations or settlements with
appropriate Governmental Entities or other third parties; provided that from
and after the time that the $5 million monetary threshold in respect of Legacy
Site Environmental Costs set forth in Section 12.3(b) has been reached, Buyer
shall not agree to any response to or resolution of such conditions or claims
with any Governmental Entity or other third party without Seller\'s prior
written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Upon reaching the $15 million monetary threshold in respect of
Legacy Site Environmental Costs set forth in Section 12.3(b), Seller shall
have the obligation to control, at its expense, all matters in respect of any
conditions or claims in respect of which Legacy Site Environmental Costs have
been or may be incurred and the resolution thereof, including control of any
negotiations or settlements with appropriate Governmental Entities or other
third parties, and Buyer shall have no rights to participate or consent in any
respect in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, Seller shall have the obligation to control, at its expense,
all matters in respect of any conditions or claims in respect of which
Damages related to FPE, Orlando Environmental Costs or St. Stephen
Environmental Costs have been or may be incurred and the resolution thereof,
including control of any negotiations or settlements with



 

64 appropriate Governmental Entities or other third parties, and Buyer shall have
no rights to participate or consent in any respect in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall have
the obligation to control, at its expense, all claims and proceedings in
respect of which Special Indemnity Costs have been or may be incurred and the
resolution thereof, including control of any negotiations or settlements with
appropriate Governmental Entities, and Buyer shall have no rights to
participate or consent in any respect in connection therewith, except that
Seller shall not agree to any such settlement (x) that provides for
injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting Buyer or any other member of
the Buyer Group or (y) that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse affect on Buyer or any other member of the Buyer Group, without
Buyer\'s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Group from and
against, and pay or reimburse, as the case may be, the Buyer Group for, all
Damages actually (and as) incurred by any member of the Buyer Group arising
out of the Seller\'s Liabilities referenced in Section 9.9(a) or arising out
of the Seller\'s or its Affiliates\' amendment, modification or termination of
retiree medical benefits or retiree life insurance benefits under
the Rockwell Welfare Benefit Plans with respect to Continued Employees or
former employees of the Acquired Companies who satisfied the applicable
eligibility requirements for such benefits under the terms of such Plans as of
the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 12.3(d) are in addition to,
and not in limitation of, the indemnity by Seller in Section 12.1.

SECTION 12.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party with respect
to any matter, or any Indemnified Party shall otherwise learn of an assertion
or of a potential claim, by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
(or an Affiliate thereof) which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_
"), then the Indemnified Party will reasonably promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of the Third Party
Claim, including the factual basis for the Third Party Claim, and, to the
extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim (except that, in the event
any member of the Buyer Group receives any documents in respect of any Actions
relating to Asbestos Liabilities, then such member of the Buyer Group will
reasonably promptly forward such documents to Seller in lieu of such
notification); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will affect the
Indemnifying Party\'s obligations under this Article XII, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof
(except that the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any expenses
incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such
notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly after the Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all
non-ministerial notices and documents (including court papers) received or
transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or to assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. The



 

65 Indemnifying Party will be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during
any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of
the Third Party Claim as provided above). Should the Indemnifying Party so
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party reasonably agree that a conflict of interest exists in
respect of such claim, such Indemnified Party will have the right to employ
separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to
represent such Indemnified Party and in that event the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one separate counsel for
all Indemnified Parties) shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim the
Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense, may retain separate counsel,
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood
that the Indemnifying Party will control such defense.

(c) No Indemnifying Party will consent to any settlement, compromise or
discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment) of any Third Party
Claim without each Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that if
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of
such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which by
its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Damages
in connection with such Third Party Claim and unconditionally releases the
Indemnified Party and each member of such Indemnified Party\'s Group
completely from all Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may refuse to agree to any
such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) that provides for injunctive or
other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or any member of
such Indemnified Party\'s Group or (y) that, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnified Party, would otherwise materially adversely affect the Indemnified
Party or any member of such Indemnified Party\'s Group. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, admit
any liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge with respect to any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party informed of
all material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the
Parties will cooperate in the defense thereof (and the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such cooperation), which
cooperation will include the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.



 

66 (e) Any claim on account of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement that does not involve a Third Party Claim will be
asserted by reasonably prompt written notice given by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is sought. The delay by
any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not affect the
Indemnifying Party\'s obligations under this Article XII, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

(f) In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnified Party in connection with any claim (an " _Indemnified Claim_ "),
such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place of
such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which
such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim relating to such
Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such
Indemnified Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party will
cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost
and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right
or claim.

(g) In connection with any matter for which a claim or demand is made, or
could reasonably be expected to be made, against an Indemnified Party which
may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement, including any matter in which indemnification may be
provided with respect to Damages related to FPE, Legacy Site Environmental
Costs, Orlando Environmental Costs, St. Stephen Environmental Costs, Special
Indemnity Costs or Asbestos Liabilities, the Indemnified Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Indemnifying Party with full and
complete access, upon reasonable request, to all documents, data, products,
product exemplars and knowledgeable personnel of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates relevant to any such matter (and the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such access). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide employees to act as witnesses, prepare
and execute statements, authorizations, orders, reports and other documents
and information and provide such other assistance, in each case that is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection with any matter
for which a claim or demand is made, or could reasonably be expected to be
made, against an Indemnified Party which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, including
in anticipation of, or preparation for, existing or future litigation or
other matters in which the Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates is
involved.

SECTION 12.5 _Certain Limitations_.

(a) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement will be reduced by any amounts actually received
(including amounts received under insurance policies) by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party from third parties (net of



 

67 out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with seeking to
collect and collecting such amounts), in respect of such Damages (such net
amounts are referred to herein as " _Indemnity Reduction Amounts_ "). If any
Indemnified Party receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect of an
Indemnified Claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement
after the full amount of such Indemnified Claim has been paid by an
Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment
of such Indemnified Claim and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the
remaining unpaid balance of such Indemnified Claim, then the Indemnified Party
will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess
(if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such Indemnified Claim, less (ii) the amount of the indemnity
payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts in
respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made. An
insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim
shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by
virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights
with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer
or any other third party shall be entitled to any benefit they would not be
entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions by
virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Seller and Buyer will, and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, pursue promptly any claims or rights it may have against
all third parties which would reduce the amount of Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement.

(b) The amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement, including under Section 13.8, will be (i) increased to take account
of any Tax cost incurred (grossed up for such increase) by the Indemnified
Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (unless such
indemnity payment is treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax
purposes) and (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages.
In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified
Party will be deemed to be subject (A) to the applicable federal and/or local
country Income Taxes at the maximum statutory rate then in effect and (B) to
state and local Taxes (if applicable) at a combined state and local Tax rate
of 5 percent, which will be Tax effected at such maximum Tax rate. Any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless a determination
(as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) or a similar event under foreign Tax
Law with respect to the Indemnified Party causes any such payment not to
constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United States federal
Income Tax purposes or foreign Tax purposes, as the case may be.

(c) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
Seller will have no obligation to indemnify any member of the Buyer Group with
respect to any matter to the extent a provision or reserve was made in the
Final Closing Statement with respect to such matter or such matter was
otherwise taken into account in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement
or if the Damages arise from a change in the accounting or Tax policies or
practices of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) on or after the Closing Date.



 

68 (d) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no
member of the Seller Group and no member of the Buyer Group will be entitled

Time by Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or any
transferee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (a _"Buyer Tax Act_ ").

terminate 30 days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless will
not terminate with respect to any individual item as to which an Indemnified
Party shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously
made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis
of such claim) to the applicable Indemnifying Party.

(d) In the case of any Straddle Period:

(i) Income Taxes of each of the Acquired Companies for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ")
will be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business
on the Closing Date, and, in the case of any Income Taxes of any of the
Acquired Companies



 

75 attributable to the ownership by any of the Acquired Companies of any equity
interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough" entity (other than the
Acquired Companies), as if a taxable period of such partnership or other
"flowthrough" entity ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date;
and

(ii) Income Taxes of each of the Acquired Companies for which a Consolidated
Tax Return is filed will be computed in accordance with the principles of

of income or delay of deductions) or results in a timing difference that would
increase Buyer\'s liability for Taxes pursuant to this Article XIII ( _e_.
_g_., an acceleration of deductions or delay of income), Buyer or Seller, as
the case may be, will promptly make payments to Seller or Buyer as and when
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, Actually Realizes any Tax benefits as a
result of such timing difference (or under such other method for determining
the present value of any such anticipated Tax benefits as agreed to by the
parties). In determining the amount of any such Tax benefit, Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, will be deemed to be subject (a) to the applicable federal
and/or local country Income Taxes at the maximum statutory rate then in effect
and (b) to state and local Taxes (if applicable) at a combined state and
local Tax rate of 5 percent, which will be Tax effected at such maximum Tax
rate.

result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 13.8, the Indemnified
Party will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim (a " _Tax
Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such notice will
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced as a result of such failure.

taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or to any other taxable
period in which any of the Acquired Companies joined in filing any
Consolidated Tax Return, Seller will control all proceedings and may make all

counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings
and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in
its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest



 

76 the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. Before taking any action with respect
to the conduct of such Tax Claim (including the submission of any protest,
petitions, or responses to information document requests), Seller shall first
consult with Buyer in good faith about such action.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.10(b), Seller and Buyer will
jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with
any Tax Claim relating to Income Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies for
any Straddle Period. Neither Seller nor Buyer will settle any such Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of the other (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
will cooperate, at the request of the other, in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation will include the retention and (upon request) the provision

80 amounts are or are not material. Matters reflected on any Schedule to this
Agreement are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement
to be reflected on such Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Matters disclosed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to any Section

SECTION 15.7 _Construction; Interpretation_. The parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall

authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement and the Schedules to this
Agreement, (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and
vice versa; (b) the terms "hereof", "herein", "herewith" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer

other information, document or material



 

81 made available or furnished to Buyer or any of its Representatives in any
"data room", management presentations or in any other form in anticipation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and none of Seller or

Liability to Buyer, any of its Representatives or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Buyer or any of its Representatives, or Buyer\'s or

of their respective Representatives to Buyer or any of its Representatives,
Buyer acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to

Person shall have any claim against Seller, any of its Affiliates, any of
their respective Representatives or any other Person with respect thereto.

SECTION 15.9  _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof to any Person or circumstance shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such
term or provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it
has been held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, will remain in full force and
effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby.

SECTION 15.10 _Dispute Resolution_. Except with respect to the Closing
Statement, in the event that any dispute, claim or controversy arises with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, this Agreement, any provision
hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement or validity or invalidity of
this Agreement or any provision hereof (collectively, a " _Dispute_ "),
designees of Seller and Buyer will meet to attempt a good faith resolution of
such Dispute within thirty days after either party notifies the other of a
Dispute. During the period between such notification of a Dispute and thirty
days after such meeting, each party shall be entitled to make any reasonable
investigation of the claims or issues underlying such Dispute that such party
deems reasonably necessary or desirable and, in connection with such
investigation, each party agrees to make available to the other party and its
Representatives the information reasonably requested by the other party in
connection therewith. If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty days
of such meeting, either party may make a written demand to the other for
formal dispute resolution, which demand will specify



 

82 the nature of the Dispute. Within thirty days of such written demand, or such
other time as the parties may agree, the parties will attempt in good faith
to resolve such Dispute by mediation in accordance with the then-existing CPR
Model Procedure for Mediation of Business Disputes, promulgated by the CPR
Institute for Dispute Resolution, in New York City. If such mediation is

relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, this Agreement, any
provision hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement or validity or
invalidity of this Agreement or any provision hereof (and agrees not to

15.3 will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
in any such courts with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Seller, each
RA Sub Seller and Buyer each irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, this Agreement,
any provision hereof or the breach, performance, enforcement or validity or
invalidity of this Agreement or any provision hereof in (i) the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, New York County or (ii) the United States District

agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or
in any other manner provided in Law or in equity.

(b) SELLER, EACH RA SUB SELLER AND BUYER EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THE BREACH, PERFORMANCE, ENFORCEMENT OR
VALIDITY OR INVALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF.

performance of its obligations hereunder, including the fees and disbursements
of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants



 

83 employed by such party in connection with the preparation, execution and
delivery by it of this Agreement and with the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated; provided that this Section 15.12 shall not limit any Person\'s
right to recover damages for any willful breach of this Agreement.

Agreement together constitute the entire agreement between Buyer and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and Seller and its Representatives, on the
other hand, with respect to the subject matter hereof and this Agreement and

or understandings of the parties and their respective Representatives of any

supplemented only by written agreement making specific reference hereto

breach of any of the covenants or agreements in this Agreement (including
Section 8.12), the party who is or is to be thereby aggrieved shall have
the right of specific performance and injunctive relief giving effect to its
rights under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and
