December 10, 2000 (this "Agreement"), among Shire Pharmaceuticals Group Plc,
a company registered in England under registry number 2883758 ("Shire"),
3829341 Canada Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada and
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Shire ("Exchangeco"), and Biochem
Pharma Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada ("BioChem").
Terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 8.11.   W I T N E
S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of BioChem, Shire and
Exchangeco deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation
and its respective shareholders that BioChem and Shire engage in a business
combination in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of
BioChem and Shire;   WHEREAS, the combination of BioChem and Shire shall be
effected by the terms of this Agreement through a plan of arrangement,
pursuant to Section 192 of the Canada Business Corporation Act (the "CBCA"),
of Exchangeco, Shire and BioChem;   WHEREAS the Arrangement is intended to
(i) provide to holders of BioChem Common Shares who are residents of Canada
for purposes of the ITA with the opportunity to dispose of their BioChem
Common Shares in return for Exchangeable Shares on a tax-deferred or
"rollover" basis for Canadian income tax purposes; and (ii) be treated as a
"pooling of interests" for financial reporting purposes under United States
generally accepted accounting principles;   WHEREAS, in order to induce
Shire to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Arrangement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, BioChem is
entering into a share option agreement with Shire pursuant to which BioChem
has granted to Shire an option, exercisable under the circumstances specified
therein, to purchase up to 19.9% of the outstanding BioChem Common Shares as
of December 8, 2000 on an undiluted basis;   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby and thereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:    ARTICLE I  THE ARRANGEMENT   1.1 Closing. Subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VI and the termination rights set forth in
Article VII, the closing of the Arrangement (the "Closing") will take place
on the first Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) set forth in   
-2-   Article VI, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its
terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the actual time and date of the Closing being referred to herein as
the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Stikeman
Elliott, 1155 Rene-Levesque Blvd. West, 40th Floor, Montreal, Quebec, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   1.2
Effective Date. At the Closing the parties shall take those actions set forth
in this Article I. The Arrangement shall become effective upon the date shown
on the certificate of arrangement to be issued by the Director under the CBCA
(such date and time the Arrangement becomes effective being the
"Effective Date").   1.3 Implementation Steps by BioChem. BioChem covenants
and agrees that BioChem shall:   (a) subject to the terms of this
Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable, apply in a manner acceptable to
Shire, acting reasonably, under Section 192 of the CBCA for an order
approving the Arrangement and for the Interim Order, and thereafter proceed
with and diligently seek the Interim Order;   (b) subject to the terms of
this Agreement, convene and hold the BioChem Shareholders Meeting for the
purpose of considering the Arrangement Resolution;   (c) except as required
for quorum purposes, not adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose for
adjournment, postponement or cancellation) the BioChem Shareholders Meeting
without Shire\'s prior written consent except as required by Laws or required
by the BioChem shareholders;   (d) use its reasonable efforts to solicit
from the BioChem shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
Arrangement Resolution and to take all other action that is necessary or
desirable to secure the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by the
shareholders of BioChem, except to the extent that the Board of Directors of
BioChem has changed its recommendation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement;   (e) subject to obtaining the approvals as are required by the
Interim Order, proceed with and diligently pursue the application to the
Court for the Final Order;   (f) subject to obtaining the Final Order and
the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions herein contained in favor
of each party, send to the Director, for endorsement and filing by the
Director, the Articles of Arrangement and such other documents as may be
required in connection therewith under the CBCA to give effect to the
Arrangement; and   (g) subject to obtaining the Final Order and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions herein contained in its favor,
execute the Support Agreement and the Exchange Trust Agreement.    
-3-    1.4 Implementation Steps by Shire. Shire covenants and agrees that
Shire shall:   (a) subject to the terms of this Agreement, convene and hold
the Shire Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of considering the Shire
Resolution;   (b) except as required for quorum purposes, not adjourn,
postpone or cancel (or propose for adjournment, postponement or cancellation)
the Shire Shareholders Meeting without BioChem\'s prior written consent
except as required by Laws or required by the Shire shareholders;   (c)
take all action that is necessary or desirable to secure the approval of the
Shire Resolution by the Shire shareholders, except to the extent that
the Board of Directors of Shire has changed its recommendation in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement; and,   (d) subject to obtaining the Final
Order and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions herein contained
in its favor, Shire shall and shall cause Exchangeco to execute and deliver
the Support Agreement and the Exchange Trust Agreement.   1.5 Interim
Order. The notice of motion for the application referred to in Section 1.3(a)
shall request that the Interim Order provide:   (a) for the class of Persons
to whom notice is to be provided in respect of the Arrangement and the
BioChem Shareholders Meeting and for the manner in which such notice is to be
provided;   (b) that the requisite approval for the Arrangement Resolution
shall be 662/3% of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by the
shareholders of BioChem present in person or by proxy at the BioChem
Shareholders Meeting or as may be decided by the Court;   (c) for the grant
of the Dissent Rights; and   (d) that, in all other respects, the terms,
restrictions and conditions of the bylaws and articles of amalgamation of
BioChem, including quorum requirements and all other matters, shall apply in
respect of the BioChem Shareholders Meeting.   1.6 Articles of
Arrangement.   (a) The Articles of Arrangement shall provide, among other
things, that at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Arrangement and without
any action on the part of the BioChem shareholders, each issued and
outstanding BioChem Common Share (other than BioChem Common Shares held by
dissenting shareholders and cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall
be     -4-   converted (through the steps described in Exhibit A
hereto) into Shire Ordinary Shares or Exchangeable Shares, at the election of
each BioChem shareholder (provided that a holder who is not a Canadian
resident for the purpose of the ITA shall not be entitled to receive
Exchangeable Shares). The number of Shire Ordinary Shares or Exchangeable
Shares into which each BioChem Common Share shall be converted (the "Exchange
Ratio") shall be determined as
follows:    ---------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------  ~~  If the Shire ADSs Price is:
the Exchange Ratio shall
be: ---------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------- less than or equal to US $47.20
2.3517 ---------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------- greater than US $47.20 and less
than US $70.80 determined by dividing US $37.00 by the  Shire ADSs Price and
multiplied by 3 ---------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------- equal to or greater than US
$70.80 1.5678 ---------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------     (b) Notwithstanding
Section 1.6(a), if a BioChem shareholder elects, Shire will provide such
BioChem shareholder with one-third of a Shire ADSs (represented by Shire
ADSs) for each Shire Ordinary Share such shareholder would be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a). Shire will pay all fees and expenses
associated with the issuance of the Shire Ordinary Shares constituting Shire
ADSs to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as depositary
(the "Depositary"), for the issuance by the Depositary of the associated
Shire ADSs.   1.7 BioChem Shares Options. The Articles of Arrangement shall
further provide that each BioChem Share Option that was granted pursuant to
the BioChem Share Option Plan prior to the Effective Date, each
Investissement Quebec Option and each BioChem Warrant which has not been
exercised and remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date
shall upon the Effective Date be adjusted and become an option or a right, as
applicable, to receive the number of Shire Ordinary Shares or Shire ADSs that
the holder of such BioChem Share Option, Investissement Quebec Option or
BioChem Warrant would have received if he or she had exercised such BioChem
Share Option, Investissement Quebec Option or BioChem Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Date. The exercise price for each such Shire Ordinary
Share or Shire ADS under such BioChem Share Option, Investissement Quebec
Option or BioChem Warrant remaining outstanding after the Effective Date will
be equal to (y) the aggregate exercise price immediately prior to the
Effective Date of the BioChem Common Shares purchasable pursuant to such
BioChem Share Option, Investissement Quebec Option or BioChem Warrant divided
by (z) the whole number of Shire Ordinary Shares or Shire ADSs
deemed purchasable pursuant to such BioChem Share Option, Investissement
Quebec Option or BioChem Warrant in accordance with the foregoing, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent. It is the intent of the parties that the exchange
of options pursuant to this Section be covered by Subsection 7(1.4) of the
ITA.     -5-    1.8 BioChem Deferred Share Unit Plans and Restricted
Share Unit Plan. Upon the Effective Date, Shire shall assume all of the
obligations of BioChem under the BioChem Deferred Share Unit Plans and the
BioChem Restricted Share Unit Plan in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such plans.   1.9 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Date, the outstanding Shire Ordinary Shares
or the BioChem Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, share split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or
any extraordinary dividend payable in cash or property or a stock dividend or
dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date
within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the number of
Shire Ordinary Shares to be received by the holders of BioChem Common Shares
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of BioChem Common
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.    ARTICLE II  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   2.1 Exchange Fund.
Prior to the Effective Date, Shire shall appoint a commercial bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to BioChem having net capital of not less than
$300,000,000, or a subsidiary thereof, to act as exchange agent hereunder for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the
"Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Date, Shire shall and shall
cause Exchangeco to deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of holders of BioChem Common Shares, certificates representing the Shire
Shares issuable on the Effective Date in exchange for BioChem Common Shares
or effect the necessary CREST or other electronic transfers. Any cash in lieu
of fractional Shire Shares (as set forth below) and certificates of Shire
Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "Exchange Fund."   2.2 No Further Ownership Rights in BioChem Common
Shares. All Shire Shares issued and cash paid upon conversion of BioChem
Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Arrangement shall
be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the BioChem Common Shares.   2.3 No Fractional Shire
Shares.     -6-    (a) No certificates or scrip or Shire Shares
representing fractional Shire Shares or book-entry credit of the same shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any
rights of a shareholder of Shire or a holder of Shire Shares.   (b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of BioChem
Common Shares exchanged pursuant to this Agreement who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a Shire Share (after taking
into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest), the whole as set forth in the Plan
of Arrangement.   2.4 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for
six months after the Effective Date shall be delivered to Shire or otherwise
on the instruction of Shire, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Shire
for any cash in lieu of fractional Shire Shares to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates five years after the Effective
Date (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity)
shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Shire free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   2.5 No Liability. None of Shire, Exchangeco, BioChem or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   2.6
Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Shire on a daily
basis; provided, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to BioChem shareholders pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement
and the other provisions of this Article II. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Shire.   2.7 Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Shire,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Shire may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate any cash in lieu of fractional
Shire Shares pursuant to this Agreement.     -7-    2.8 Withholding
Rights. Shire shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of BioChem Common
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the ITA and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
provincial, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Shire, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the BioChem Common Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Shire provided
that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority.   2.9 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no certificates representing
Shire Shares or cash shall be delivered to a Person who may be deemed an
"affiliate" of BioChem in accordance with Section 5.11 hereof for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")
until such Person has executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement to
Shire.    ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   3.1
Representations and Warranties of Shire. Except as set forth in the Shire
Disclosure Schedule delivered by Shire to BioChem prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the "Shire Disclosure Schedule"), Shire represents
and warrants to BioChem as follows:   (a) Organization and Power;
Subsidiaries.   (i) Each of Shire and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized and  validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation  or organization, has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease  and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being 
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized and existing or  to
have such power and authority, in the aggregate, would not have a  Material
Adverse Effect on Shire, and is duly qualified and in good  standing to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of  its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such  qualification necessary
other than in such jurisdictions where the  failure so to qualify or to be in
good standing, in the aggregate,  would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Shire. The copies of the  certificate of incorporation and Memorandum and
Articles of  Association of Shire, which were previously furnished or made 
available     -8-    to BioChem, are true, complete and correct copies
of such documents as  in effect on the date of this Agreement.   (ii)
Section 3.1(a)(ii) of the Shire Disclosure Schedule sets forth all the 
Subsidiaries of Shire which, as of the date of this Agreement, are 
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of  the
SEC). All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other  equity
interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary have been  validly issued and
are fully paid and non-assessable and are, except  as set forth on the Shire
Disclosure Schedule, owned directly or  indirectly by Shire, free and clear
of all pledges, claims, liens,  charges, encumbrances and security interests
of any kind or nature  whatsoever (collectively "Liens") and free of any
other restriction  (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise  dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests),
except  for restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Except as
set  forth in the Shire SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) filed 
prior to the date hereof, as of the date of this Agreement, neither  Shire
nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any  equity or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or  exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any  corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association  or entity (other
than Subsidiaries), that is or would be material to  Shire and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   (b) Capital Structure.   (i) As of
December 7, 2000, the authorized share capital of Shire  consisted of
400,000,000 Shire Ordinary Shares and the issued share  capital consisted of
256,837,043 Shire Ordinary Shares. Since December  7, 2000 to the date of
this Agreement, there have been no issuances of  Shire Ordinary Shares or any
other securities of Shire other than  issuances of Shire Ordinary Shares
pursuant to options or rights  outstanding as of December 7, 2000 under the
Shire Share Option Plans.  All issued and outstanding Shire Ordinary Shares
are, and when Shire  Ordinary Shares will be issued pursuant to this
Agreement, such shares  will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable  and free of any preemptive rights. There were outstanding
as of  December 7, 2000, no options, warrants or other rights to acquire 
Shire Ordinary Shares other than rights pursuant to awards under the  Shire
Pharmaceuticals Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Long  Term Incentive
Plan") and under the Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive  Share Option Scheme
(parts A and B), the Richwood 1993 Stock Option  Plan, the Richwood 1995
Stock Option Plan, the Shire Holdings Limited  Share Option Scheme, the
Imperial Pharmaceutical Services Limited  Employee Share Option Scheme
(Number One), the Pharmavene 1991 Stock  Option Plan (as amended),
the     -9-    Shire Pharmaceuticals Sharesave Scheme, the Shire
Pharmaceuticals  Group plc Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Roberts\'
Incentive Stock  Option Plan, the Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 2000
Executive Share  Option Scheme, the Roberts\' 1996 Equity Incentive Plan and
the  Roberts\' Restricted Stock Option Plan (together with the Long Term 
Incentive Plan, the "Shire Share Option Plans") to acquire Shire  Ordinary
Shares representing in the aggregate the right to purchase  approximately
9,913,338 Shire Ordinary Shares and options  (collectively, the "Shire Share
Options"). Section 3.1(b) of the Shire  Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list, as of  December 7, 2000, of the number of Shire
Ordinary Shares subject to  Shire Share Options or other rights to purchase
or receive Shire  Ordinary Shares, the dates of grant and the exercise prices
thereof.   (ii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.1(b) and
as  contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement, as of the date of this 
Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, 
commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to  which
Shire or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of  them is bound
obligating Shire or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,  deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional  shares or other voting
securities of Shire or any of its Subsidiaries  or obligating Shire or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend  or enter into any such security,
option, warrant, call, right,  commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking. As of the date of  this Agreement, there are no outstanding
obligations of Shire or any  of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any  shares of Shire or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c)
Authority; No Conflicts.   (i) Shire has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into  this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby,  subject to the adoption of this Agreement and the
Arrangement by the  Required Shire Vote (the "Shire Shareholders Approval").
The execution  and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all  necessary
corporate action on the part of Shire, subject to obtaining  the Shire
Shareholders Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed  and delivered
by Shire and constitutes the valid and binding agreement  of Shire,
enforceable against Shire in accordance with its terms,  except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws relating to or  affecting creditors generally or
by general equity principles  (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a  proceeding in equity or at law).     -10-    (ii) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shire does not, and  the
consummation by Shire of the Arrangement and the other  transactions
contemplated hereby will not conflict with, or result in  any violation of,
or constitute a default (with or without notice or  lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of, or result  by its terms in the
termination, amendment, cancellation or  acceleration of any obligation or
the loss of a material benefit  under, or the creation of a lien, pledge,
security interest, charge or  other encumbrance on, or the loss of, any
assets, including  Intellectual Property (any such conflict, violation,
default, right of  termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss
or  creation, a "Violation") pursuant to: (A) any provision of the 
Memorandum and Articles of Association or similar organizational  documents
of Shire or any Significant Subsidiary of Shire, or (B)  except as in the
aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on  Shire, subject to
obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders,  authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings referred to in  paragraph (iii)
below, any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage,  bond, indenture, lease,
benefit plan or other agreement, obligation,  instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, license, judgment, order,  decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation applicable to  Shire, any Significant Subsidiary of Shire, or
their respective  properties or assets.   (iii) No consent, approval, order
or authorization of, or registration,  declaration or filing with, any
supranational, national, state,  provincial, municipal, local or foreign
government, any  instrumentality, subdivision, court, administrative agency
or  commission or other authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental or 
private body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing or other 
governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a "Governmental  Entity"), is
required by or with respect to Shire or any Subsidiary of  Shire in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement  by Shire or the
consummation of the Arrangement and the other  transactions contemplated
hereby, except for those required under or  in relation to (A) the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of  1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),
(B) the Competition Act (Canada)  (the "CA"), (C) state securities or "blue
sky" laws (the "Blue Sky  Laws"), (D) the Securities Act, (E) the Canadian
Securities Laws, (F)  the Exchange Act, (G) the CBCA with respect to the
filing of the  Articles of Arrangement, (H) the Financial Services Act 1986,
(I) the  Listing Rules or the Rules of the LSE, (J) the Investment Canada
Act  (the "ICA"), (K) the consent of a --- Canadian court to the Plan of 
Arrangement and (L) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, 
registrations, declarations and filings the failures of which to make  or
obtain, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect  on Shire.
Consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,  declarations and
filings required under or in     -11-    relation to any of the
foregoing clauses (A) through (K) are  hereinafter referred to as "Necessary
Consents."   (d) Reports and Financial Statements.   (i) Shire has filed
all required registration statements, prospectuses,  reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required to  be filed by it with the
SEC since January 1, 1999 (collectively,  including all exhibits thereto, the
"Shire SEC Reports"). No  Subsidiary of Shire is required to file any form,
report, registration  statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC.
None of the  Shire SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if amended
or  superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the 
Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained or will  contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will  omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the  financial statements (including the
related notes) included in the  Shire SEC Reports presents fairly, in all
material respects, the  consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations  and cash flows of Shire and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the  respective dates or for the respective periods set
forth therein, all  in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods  involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the
case  of the unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of
notes  and normal year-end adjustments that have not been and are not 
expected to be material in amount. All of such Shire SEC Reports, as  of
their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the 
respective Shire SEC Report), complied as to form in all material  respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and  the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.   (ii) Except as
disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date  hereof, since
December 31, 1999, Shire and its Subsidiaries have not  incurred any
liabilities that are of a nature that would be required  to be disclosed on a
balance sheet of Shire and its Subsidiaries or  the footnotes thereto
prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than  liabilities that, in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse  Effect on Shire.   (e)
Information Supplied.   (i) None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Shire for  inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will,  at the time it is filed with the SEC or at any time it is
amended or  supplemented, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit  to state any material fact    -12-    required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading in light
of the circumstances under which they  were made. The Proxy Statement will,
on the date it is first mailed to  Shire shareholders and at the time of the
Shire Shareholders Meeting,  not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state  any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order  to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under  which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement will comply  as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the  Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder.   (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.1(e), no  representation or warranty is made by Shire with respect to
statements  made in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by
BioChem  for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein or in the
Listing  Particulars or Class 1 Circular.   (f) Board Approval. The Board
of Directors of Shire, by resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called
and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "Shire
Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Arrangement are fair to and in the best interests of Shire and its
shareholders, and (ii) approved this Agreement and the Arrangement, and (iii)
subject to Section 5.1(f), resolved to recommend that the shareholders of
Shire approve this Agreement and the Arrangement and directed that this
Agreement and the Arrangement be submitted for consideration at the Shire

and the Arrangement by the Required Shire Vote is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Shire share capital necessary to approve
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement.   (h)
Litigation; Compliance with Laws.   (i) Except as disclosed in the Shire SEC
Reports filed prior to the date  of this Agreement, there are no suits,
actions, complaints or  proceedings (collectively "Actions") pending or, to
the knowledge of  Shire, threatened, against or affecting Shire or any
Subsidiary of  Shire which, in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse
Effect on  Shire, nor are there any judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules
or  orders of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against 
Shire or any Subsidiary of Shire which, in the aggregate, would have a 
Material Adverse Effect on Shire.   (ii) Except as disclosed in the Shire
SEC Reports filed prior to the date  of this Agreement and except as, in the
aggregate, would not have a  Material     -13-    Adverse Effect on
Shire, Shire and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,  licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all  Governmental Entities which are
necessary for the operation of the  businesses of Shire and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (the "Shire  Permits"). Shire and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms  of the Shire Permits, except where the failure to
so comply, in the  aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Shire. Except  as disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this  Agreement, neither Shire nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation  of, and Shire and its Subsidiaries have not received any notices
of  violations with respect to, any laws, ordinances or regulations of any 
Governmental Entity, except for violations which, in the aggregate,  would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on Shire.   (i) Absence of Certain
Changes or Events.   (i) Except for general tax matters and matters relating
to the  pharmaceutical industry generally, liabilities incurred in
connection  with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or 
disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this 
Agreement, and except as permitted by Section 4.1, since September 30,  2000,
Shire and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in  the
ordinary course. Except as disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports  filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, since September 30, 2000,  there have not been
any changes, circumstances or events which, in the  aggregate, have had, or
would have, a Material Adverse Effect on  Shire.   (ii) Since September 30,
2000 and except for as set forth on Section  3.1(i)(ii) of the Shire
Disclosure Schedule, there has not been any  (A) adoption by Shire or any of
its Subsidiaries of any Benefit Plan  to which any of the officers of Shire
or a Subsidiary of Shire is a  participant or (B) amendment to any Shire
Benefit Plan that resulted  in any material increase in the benefits received
or to be received  thereunder by any officer of Shire. Since September 30,
2000, there  has not been any material increase in the aggregate benefits
provided  under the Shire Benefit Plans.   (j) Environmental Matters.

this Agreement, Shire and its Subsidiaries, and their respective  business
and operations, (A) are in compliance with all applicable  Environmental Laws
(including any Environmental Permits) in the United  States and in other
applicable foreign jurisdictions with  environmental regulatory jurisdiction
over Shire or any of its  Subsidiaries and (B) have obtained all
Environmental Permits which are  required in order to carry on their
respective businesses and  operations as presently conducted under all
applicable Environmental  Laws, where non-compliance or failure to
obtain     -14-    the same would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Shire. Except as  disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this  Agreement, neither Shire nor its Subsidiaries with respect to
their  respective businesses and operations have at any time received any 
written notice, written notice of default, written notice of  cancellation or
revocation, orders, summons, or notice of judgment or  commencement of
proceedings of any nature related to any breach,  liability or remedial
action, or alleged breach, liability or remedial  action, of or arising under
Environmental Laws or any Environmental  Permits which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Shire. Neither  Shire nor its Subsidiaries with respect to
their respective businesses  and operations have at any time given any
written undertakings with  respect to remedying any breach of Environmental
Laws or Environmental  Permits or otherwise satisfying requirements under
Environmental Laws  or Environmental Permits which have not been duly
performed in  accordance with the terms of such undertakings, which breach or
other  requirements would have a Material Adverse Effect on Shire.   (ii)
To the knowledge of Shire, without inquiry to any Governmental Entity,  (A)
none of the properties currently or formerly owned or leased by  Shire and
its Subsidiaries is identified by any Governmental Entity  for investigation
or clean-up pursuant to any Environmental Laws,  which in each of the
foregoing instances would result in a Material  Adverse Effect on Shire and
(B) there have been no releases in  violation of any applicable Environmental
Laws of Hazardous Substances  on any currently owned, leased or operated
property or formerly owned,  leased or operated property of Shire or its
Subsidiaries, which would  result in a Material Adverse Effect on Shire.  
(iii) Except as disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date 
of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Shire, neither Shire nor any of  its
Subsidiaries is subject to any Environmental Losses that would  have a
Material Adverse Effect on Shire.   (k) Intellectual Property. Except as in
the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Shire and except as
disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date of the Agreement,
to the knowledge of Shire: (i) Shire and each of its Subsidiaries owns (in
each case, free and clear of any Liens), controls or has license to use, all
Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as
currently conducted; (ii) Shire and its Subsidiaries are not infringing or
otherwise violating the Intellectual Property of any Person and are acting in
accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Shire or any

Intellectual Property owned or controlled by and/or licensed to Shire or its
Subsidiaries used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as

received any written notice or otherwise has knowledge of any pending or
threatened claim, order or proceeding with respect to     -15-   any
Intellectual Property owned, controlled, licensed or used by Shire or
its Subsidiaries and no Intellectual Property owned, controlled and/or
licensed by Shire or its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner
that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of
such Intellectual Property. For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual
Property" shall mean patents, applications for patents (including, without
limitation, utility models and all divisions, continuations, continuations in
part and renewal applications), and any renewals, extensions or reissues
thereof, in any jurisdiction, trademarks (registered or unregistered),
service marks, brand names, domain names, certification marks, trade dress
and other indications of origin, the goodwill associated with the foregoing
and registrations in any jurisdiction of, and applications in any
jurisdiction to register, the foregoing, including any extension,
modification or renewal of any such registration or application; inventions,
discoveries and ideas, whether patentable or not, in any jurisdiction;
nonpublic information, trade secrets and confidential or proprietary
information and rights in any jurisdiction to limit the use or disclosure
thereof by any person; writings and other works, whether copyrightable or

similar intellectual property or proprietary rights.   (l) Brokers or
Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm
or Person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any
other similar commission or fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Shire, except Deutsche Bank whose fees and expenses will be paid by Shire
in accordance with Shire\'s agreement with such firm, copies of which have
been provided to BioChem.   (m) Taxes.   (i) Each of Shire and its
Subsidiaries has filed in a timely manner all  material Tax Returns required
to have been filed (or extensions have  been duly obtained), and has paid in
a timely manner all Taxes  required to have been paid by it and has made
adequate accrual for all  material taxes not yet due and payable. Each such
Tax Return is  complete and accurate in all material respects. Any
deficiencies or  assessments asserted in writing by any taxing authority
against Shire  or any of its Subsidiaries have been paid or fully settled.
There are  no claims or assessments pending (or, to the best knowledge or
Shire,  threatened) against Shire or any of its Subsidiaries for any
alleged  Tax deficiency and no issue has been raised in writing by any
taxing  authority or representative thereof. No extension of the period for 
assessment or collection of any Tax of Shire or its Subsidiaries is 
currently in effect and no extension of time within which to file any  Tax
Return has been requested, which Tax Return has not since been  filed.  
(ii) Shire is not and will not be at any time a "foreign investment entity" 
as that term is defined in the June 22, 2000 proposed amendments to  the ITA
together with proposed amendments thereto as announced on  September 7, 2000
(the "Proposed Amendments"). The Exchangeable Shares  will be    
-16-    and remain an "exempt interest" as that term is defined in the 
Proposed Amendments.  For purposes of this Agreement: (A) "Tax" (and, with
correlative meaning, "Taxes") means (i) any federal, state, provincial, local
or foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales, use, license, excise,
franchise, employment, payroll, withholding, alternative or add on minimum,
ad valorem, transfer or excise tax, or any other tax, customs, duty,
governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever,
together with any interest or penalty, imposed by any governmental authority,
and (ii) any transferee, successor or joint and several liability by contract
or otherwise in respect of any items described in clause (i), and (B) "Tax
Return" means any return, report or similar statement required to be filed
with respect to any Tax (including any attached schedules), including,
without limitation, any information return, claim for refund, amended return
or declaration of estimated Tax.   (n) Benefit Plans   (i) Except as
disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date  of this
Agreement, (A) there are no registered or supplementary  pension, retirement,
profit sharing, bonus, savings, deferred  compensation, share option,
purchase, appreciation, group insurance or  other material employee or
retiree benefit plans, programs or  arrangements, including collective
agreements, maintained or  contributed to by Shire or any of its Subsidiaries
or in respect of  which any such entity has an actual or contingent liability
(each such  plan, program or arrangement, a "Plan"), (B) there are no
outstanding  violations or defaults thereunder nor any actions, claims, or
other  proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Shire, threatened in 
writing with respect to any of the Plans, (C) the Plans are  registered, and
have at all times been invested and administered, in  accordance with Laws
and regulatory policy and the terms of the Plans,  (D) no event has occurred
which would entitle any person to terminate  any Plan or adversely affect the
tax status of any Plan; (E) to the  knowledge of Shire, there have been no
withdrawals of surplus or  contribution holiday except as permitted by Law
and the terms of the  Plans and (F) no Plan is underfunded on either a going
concern or a  solvency basis as of the date of its most recent actuarial
evaluation,  where the effect of any such undisclosed Plan, violation,
default,  action, claim, proceeding, promise, commitment, event,
withdrawal,  contribution holiday, failure to comply or underfunding would,
in the  aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Shire.   (ii) Except
as disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to the date  of this
Agreement, none of the Plans with respect to Shire is subject  to the United
States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,  as amended
("ERISA"). With respect to each Plan that is subject to  ERISA (an    
-17-    "ERISA Plan") and any ERISA Affiliate Plan (A) if such ERISA Plan
is  intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, such ERISA 
Plan has been determined by the United States Internal Revenue Service  (the
"IRS") to be so qualified and each trust related to any such  ERISA Plan has
been determined to be exempt from federal income Tax  under Section 501(a) of
the Code and no circumstance has occurred or  exists which might reasonably
be expected to cause such plan or trust  to cease being so qualified or
exempt from Tax; (B) such ERISA Plan  has complied in all material respects
with ERISA, and all other  applicable Laws; (C) no accumulated funding
deficiency, as defined in  Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code,
whether or not  waived, exists with respect to such Plan or any ERISA
Affiliate Plan;  (D) with respect to each single-employer ERISA Plan and
ERISA  Affiliate Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, as of the last day of
the  most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially 
determined present value of all "benefit liabilities" (as defined  under
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such plan, determined on the  basis of
the actuarial assumptions in effect for such plan year, did  not exceed the
then current value of the assets of such plan; and (E)  none of Shire, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has  incurred or expects to incur any
liability to the United States  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with
respect to any ERISA Plan or  ERISA Affiliate Plan or any withdrawal
liability under Title IV of  ERISA with respect to any "Multiemployer Plan",
where the effect of  such event, condition, action or failure to act under
(A) through (E)  above would, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on  Shire. Except as disclosed in the Shire SEC Reports filed prior to
the  date of this Agreement, none of Shire, or any of its Subsidiaries 
maintains or contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan (as  defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is subject to ERISA and which  provides medical
benefits to employees after termination of employment  other than as required
by Section 601 of ERISA or other applicable  Law, or the cost of which is
paid for by the covered employees.   (iii) For purposes of this Agreement,
"ERISA Affiliate" means (A) any  corporation which is a member of the same
controlled group of  corporations, within the meaning of Section 414(b) of
the Code, as  Shire or BioChem, as the case may be, or any of their
respective  Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or (B) any partnership or trade
or  business (whether or not incorporated) under common control, within  the
meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code, with Shire or BioChem, as  the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries;  "Multiemployer Plan" means
any Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" (as  defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA); and "ERISA Affiliate Plan"  means any single-employer plan subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of  ERISA maintained or contributed to by an ERISA
Affiliate.     -18-    (o) Licenses. Shire and its Subsidiaries have
obtained all permits, concessions, grants, franchises, licenses and other
federal, state, local or foreign governmental authorizations and approvals
(collectively, "Licenses") material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
conduct of the business of Shire and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. All
of such Licenses are in full force and effect and, to the knowledge of Shire,
will not be impaired or adversely affected by the Arrangement in a manner or
to a degree that would have a Material Adverse Effect on Shire. There is not
pending or, to the knowledge of Shire, threatened any domestic or foreign
suit or proceeding with respect to the suspension, revocation, cancellation,
modification or non-renewal of any of such Licenses, and no event under the
control of Shire has occurred that (whether with notice or lapse of time, or
both) would result in a suspension or revocation of or failure to renew any
of the Licenses, the loss of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Shire.   (p) Pooling of Interests. Neither Shire nor any of its Affiliates
has taken or agreed to take any action or failed to take any action that
would prevent the Arrangement from being treated for financial accounting
purposes as a "pooling of interests" in accordance with US GAAP and the
regulations and interpretations of the SEC.   3.2 Representations and
Warranties of BioChem. Except as set forth in the BioChem Disclosure Schedule
delivered by BioChem to Shire prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"BioChem Disclosure Schedule"), BioChem represents and warrants to Shire as
follows:   (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.   (i) Each
of BioChem and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,  validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its  jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the requisite power  and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on  its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so  organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and  authority, in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect  on BioChem. Each of BioChem and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and  in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the  nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties  makes such qualification necessary other than in such
jurisdictions  where the failures so to qualify or to be in good standing in
the  aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on BioChem. The 
copies of the articles of amalgamation and bylaws of BioChem, which  were
previously furnished or made available to Shire, are true,  complete    
-19-    and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of
this  Agreement.   (ii) Section 3.2(a)(ii) of the BioChem Disclosure
Schedule sets forth all  of the Subsidiaries of BioChem as of the date of
this Agreement. All  the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests  in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
fully paid  and non-assessable and are, except as set forth on the BioChem 
Disclosure Schedule, owned directly or indirectly by BioChem, free and  clear
of all Liens and free of any other restriction (including any  restriction on
the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such  capital stock or other
ownership interests), except for restrictions  imposed by applicable
securities laws or contained in the articles of  such companies. Except as
Publicly Disclosed by BioChem prior to the  date of this Agreement, neither
BioChem nor any of its Subsidiaries  directly or indirectly owns any equity
or similar interest in, or any  interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any  equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint  venture or other business association or entity (other
than  Subsidiaries), that is material to BioChem and its Subsidiaries taken 
as a whole.   (b) Capital Structure.   (i) As of November 24, 2000, the
authorized capital of BioChem consisted  of an unlimited number of BioChem
Common Shares, of which 101,323,410  shares were issued and outstanding.
Since November 24, 2000 to the  date of this Agreement, there have been no
issuances of shares in the  capital of BioChem or any other securities of
BioChem other than  issuances of shares pursuant to options outstanding as of
November 24,  2000 under the Benefit Plans of BioChem. All issued and
outstanding  shares in the capital of BioChem are duly authorized, validly
issued,  fully paid and non-assessable, and no class of shares is entitled
to  preemptive rights. There were outstanding as of November 24, 2000 no 
options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of BioChem other  than
(w) options and other rights to acquire shares of BioChem  representing in
the aggregate the right to purchase 6,873,711 BioChem  Common Shares
(collectively, the "BioChem Share Options") under  BioChem\'s Shares Option
Plan (the "BioChem Share Option Plan"), and  (x) options to acquire 123,476
BioChem Common Shares at an exercise  price of $5.15 expiring in July 2001
granted to Investissement Quebec  pursuant to an agreement dated June 21,
1991 (the "Investissement  Quebec Options"); and (y) undertaking to issue
warrants in two  tranches in 2001 and 2002 to the Government of Canada giving
the right  to acquire BioChem Common Shares at an exercise price equal to
the  closing price on the TSE prior to their     -20-    respective
issuance, the whole pursuant to an agreement dated March  31, 2000 (the
"BioChem Warrants") and (z) the memorandum of agreement  dated September 1997
with two senior employees relating to options to  acquire 40,000 BioChem
Common Shares. Section 3.2(b) of the BioChem  Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete and correct list, as of  November 24, 2000, of the number of
BioChem Common Shares subject to  BioChem Shares Options, the dates of grant
and the exercise prices  thereof.   (ii) No bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of BioChem having  the right to vote on any matters on
which its shareholders may vote  ("BioChem Voting Debt") are issued or
outstanding.   (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.2(b),
as of the date  of this Agreement, there are no securities, options,
warrants, calls,  rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any  kind to which BioChem or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by  which any of them is bound obligating BioChem or any of its 
Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,  delivered or
sold, additional shares in its capital or other voting  securities of BioChem
or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating BioChem  or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue, grant, extend or enter into any  such security, option, warrant,
call, right, commitment, agreement,  arrangement or undertaking. As of the
date of this Agreement, there  are no outstanding obligations of BioChem or
any of its Subsidiaries  to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares in the capital  of BioChem or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c)
Authority; No Conflicts.   (i) BioChem has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into  this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby,  subject in the case of the consummation of the
Arrangement to the  adoption of this Agreement by the Required BioChem Vote.
The execution  and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all  necessary
corporate action on the part of BioChem, subject in the case  of the
consummation of the Arrangement to the adoption of this  Agreement by the
BioChem shareholders at the BioChem Shareholders  Meeting. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by  BioChem and constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of BioChem,  enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such  enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or
affecting  creditors generally or by general equity     -21-   
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in  a
proceeding in equity or at law).   (ii) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by BioChem does not or  will not, as the case may be, and the
consummation by BioChem of the  Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not  conflict with, or result in a Violation
pursuant to: (x) any provision  of the articles of amalgamation or bylaws of
BioChem or any Subsidiary  of BioChem or (y) except as in the aggregate would
not have a Material  Adverse Effect on BioChem or, subject to obtaining or
making the  consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, 
declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any  loan or
credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease,  benefit plan or
other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit,  concession, franchise,
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law,  ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to BioChem, any Subsidiary of  BioChem or any of their
respective properties or assets.   (iii) No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration,  declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or  with respect to BioChem or any
Subsidiary of BioChem in connection  with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by BioChem or the  consummation of the Arrangement and the other
transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby, except (i) the Necessary
Consents,  (ii) the consents required under Canadian Securities Laws and by
the  rules and regulations of the NASDAQ and the TSE and (iii) such 
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,  declarations and
filings the failure of which to make or obtain, in  the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on BioChem.   (d) Reports and Financial
Statements.   (i) BioChem has filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses,  reports, schedules, forms, statements, press releases and
other  documents required to be filed by it with the OSC, the QSC and the
SEC  since January 1, 1999 (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, 
the "BioChem Reports"). No Subsidiary of BioChem is required to file  any
form, report, registration statement or prospectus or other  document with
the OSC, the QSC or the SEC. None of the BioChem  Reports, as of their
respective dates (and, if amended or superseded  by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement or the Closing Date,  then on the date of such
filing), contained or will contain any untrue  statement of a material fact
or omitted or will omit to state a  material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the  statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which     -22-    they were made, not misleading.
Each of the financial statements  (including the related notes) included in
the BioChem Reports presents  fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position  and consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of BioChem and  its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates or for the  respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity
with GAAP  consistently applied during the periods involved except as
otherwise  noted therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim 
financial statements, to the absence of notes and normal and recurring  year-
end adjustments that have not been and are not expected to be  material in
amount. All of such BioChem Reports, as of their  respective dates (and as of
the date of any amendment to any such  BioChem Report), complied as to form
in all material respects with the  applicable requirements of Canadian
Securities Laws or, as the case  may be, the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and  regulations promulgated thereunder.   (ii) Except as
Publicly Disclosed by BioChem prior to the date of this  Agreement, since
September 30, 2000, BioChem and its Subsidiaries have  not incurred any
liabilities that are of a nature that would be  required to be disclosed on a
balance sheet of BioChem and its  Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto
prepared in conformity with  GAAP, other than liabilities that, in the
aggregate, would not have a  Material Adverse Effect on BioChem.   (e)
Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
BioChem for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, at the time of the BioChem Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.   (f) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of BioChem, by
resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly
called and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the
"BioChem Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and
the Arrangement are fair to and in the best interests of BioChem and its
shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Arrangement and (iii)
subject to Section 5.1(e), recommended that the shareholders of BioChem adopt

alleged Tax deficiency and  no issue has been raised in writing by any taxing
authority or  representative thereof. No extension of the period for
assessment or  collection of any Tax of BioChem or its Subsidiaries is
currently in  effect and no extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return  has been requested, which Tax Return has not since been filed.  
(ii) No corporation, partnership or other entity owned directly or 
indirectly in whole or in part by BioChem is a "United States person",  as
defined under Section 7701(a) (30) of the Internal Revenue Code of  1986, as

have at  all times been invested and administered, in accordance with Laws
and  regulatory policy and the terms of the Plans, (D) no event has 
occurred which would entitle any person to terminate any Plan or  adversely
affect the tax status of any Plan; (E) to the knowledge of  BioChem, there
have been no withdrawals of surplus or contribution  holiday except as
permitted by Law and the terms of the Plans and (F)  no Plan is underfunded
on either a going concern or a solvency basis  as of the date of its most
recent actuarial evaluation, where the  effect of any such undisclosed Plan,
violation, default, action,  claim, proceeding, promise, commitment, event,
withdrawal,  contribution holiday, failure to comply or underfunding would
have a  Material Adverse Effect on BioChem.   (ii) Except as Publicly
Disclosed by BioChem prior to the date of this  Agreement, none of the Plans
with respect to BioChem is subject to  ERISA. With respect to each ERISA Plan
and any ERISA Affiliate Plan  (A) if such ERISA Plan is intended to be
qualified under Section  401(a) of the Code, such ERISA Plan has been
determined by the United  States Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified
and each trust  related to any such ERISA Plan has been determined to be
exempt from  federal income Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and no 
circumstance has occurred or exists which might cause such plan or  trust to
cease being so qualified or exempt from Tax; (B) such ERISA  Plan has
complied in all material respects with ERISA, and all other  applicable Laws;

as of the last day of the  most recent plan year ended prior to the date
hereof, the actuarially  determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities" (as defined  under Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such
plan, determined on the  basis of the actuarial assumptions in effect for
such plan year, did  not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
plan; and (E)  none of BioChem, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate has  incurred or expects to incur any liability to the United
States  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any ERISA Plan
or  ERISA Affiliate Plan or    -29-    any withdrawal liability under
Title IV of ERISA with respect to any  Multiemployer Plan, where the effect
of such event, condition, action  or failure to act under (A) through (E)
above would be reasonably  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
BioChem. Except as  Publicly Disclosed by BioChem prior to the date of this
Agreement,  none of BioChem, or any of its Subsidiaries maintains or
contributes  to any employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1)
of  ERISA) which is subject to ERISA and which provides medical benefits  to
employees after termination of employment other than as required by  Section
601 of ERISA or other applicable Law, or the cost of which is  paid for by
the covered employees.   (p) Licenses. BioChem and its Subsidiaries have
obtained all Licenses material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
conduct of the business of BioChem and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. All

manner or to a degree that would have a Material Adverse Effect on BioChem.
There is not pending or, to the knowledge of BioChem, threatened any domestic
or foreign suit or proceeding with respect to the suspension, revocation,
cancellation, modification or non-renewal of any of such licenses, and no
event under the control of BioChem has occurred that (whether with notice or
lapse of time, or both) would result in a suspension or revocation of or
failure to renew any of the Licenses, the loss of which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on BioChem.   (q) Pooling of Interests. Neither BioChem nor
any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or failed to
take any action that would prevent the Arrangement from being treated for
financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" in accordance with
US GAAP and the regulations and interpretations of the SEC.   (r) Labor  
(i) No trade union, association of employees, certified association,  council
of trade unions, employee bargaining agency or affiliated  bargaining agent,
holds bargaining rights with respect to any  employees of BioChem by way of
certification, interim certification,  voluntary recognition, designation or
successor rights, except for  those locations and employees covered by the
collective agreement set  forth in Section 3.2(r)(i) of the BioChem
Disclosure Schedule.   (ii) To the best of BioChem\'s knowledge, there are
no organizing activities  of any trade union, council of trade unions,
association of employees,  certified association, employee bargaining agency
or affiliated  bargaining agent.     -30-    3.3 Representations and

intact their present  lines of business, maintain their rights and franchises
and preserve  their relationships with customers, suppliers and others
having  business dealings with them to the end that their ongoing
businesses  shall not be impaired in any material respect at the Effective
Date;  provided, however, that no action by BioChem or its Subsidiaries
with  respect to matters specifically addressed by any other provision of 
this Section 4.2 shall be deemed a breach of this Section 4.2(a)(i)  unless
such action would constitute a breach of one or more of such  other
provisions.   (ii) Other than in connection with acquisitions permitted by
Section  4.2(e), BioChem shall not, and shall not permit any of its 
Subsidiaries to enter into (A) any new material line of business or  (B) any

expenditure or purchase, sale or lease of assets) other than  in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and  which, together with
all such agreements, commitments and transactions  since the date of this
Agreement, does not require expenditures by  BioChem in excess of fifty
million dollars ($50,000,000) provided that  if the required expenditures
exceed thirty-five million dollars  ($35,000,000), BioChem shall, before
completing such expenditures,  verbally advise Shire; notwithstanding the
foregoing, BioChem shall  not enter into any agreement or arrangement to
license a material  product if the total consideration exceeds five million
dollars  ($5,000,000) without the prior consent of Shire, which consent
shall  not be unreasonably withheld.   (b) Dividends; Changes in Share
Capital. BioChem shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,

share capital or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any of
its share capital.     -36-    (c) Issuance of Securities. BioChem

hereof, in each case in accordance with their present terms or pursuant to
BioChem Shares Options or Investissement Quebec Options or other shares based
awards granted pursuant to clause (iii) below, (ii) issuances by a wholly
owned Subsidiary of BioChem of share capital to such Subsidiary\'s parent or
another wholly owned subsidiary of BioChem, (iii) the granting of BioChem
Shares Options or other shares based awards to acquire BioChem Common Shares

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that would
not result in the issuance of more than 100,000 BioChem Common Shares
provided that such grant of BioChem Share Options or other shares based award
is done in connection with the hiring of new employees by BioChem and
provided however that BioChem shall consult with Shire prior to granting any
BioChem Share Options and shall not proceed with such grant if advised by
Shire that such grant would result in a reverse take-over bid of Shire or
would affect the pooling of interest accounting treatment of the transaction
contemplated herein, or (iii) pursuant to the arrangements set forth in
Section 4.2(c) of the BioChem Disclosure Schedule.   (d) Governing
Documents. Except to the extent required to comply with its obligations

division thereof or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets (other
than the acquisition of assets used in the operations of the business of
BioChem and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course, which assets do not
constitute a business unit, division or all or substantially of the assets of
the transferor); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i)
internal reorganizations or consolidations involving existing Subsidiaries of
BioChem or (ii) the creation of new Subsidiaries of BioChem organized to
conduct or continue activities otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

any of its Subsidiaries existing at the date of this Agreement or (C) in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in an aggregate
amount not in excess of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) (provided that
none of such transactions referred to in this sub-clause (C) presents a
material risk of making it more difficult to obtain any approval or
authorization required in connection with the Arrangement under Regulatory
Laws and provided that if the amount of such loans, advances, capital
contributions or investments exceed thirty five million dollars
($35,000,000), BioChem shall, before completing such loans, advances, capital

may be amended, extended, modified, refunded, renewed or refinanced after the
date of this Agreement; notwithstanding the foregoing, BioChem shall make no
additional investments in or advances to GeneChem LP without first consulting

except as required by changes in GAAP as concurred with by BioChem\'s
independent public accountants. BioChem shall not (i) change its fiscal year
or (ii) make, modify or revoke any material tax election, other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.   (j) Certain
Agreements. BioChem shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, enter into any agreements or arrangements that limit or otherwise
restrict BioChem or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates or any successor thereto, or that could, after the
Effective Date, limit or restrict Shire or any of its affiliates or any
successor thereto, from engaging or competing in any line of business or in
any geographic area which agreements or arrangements, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on Shire, after giving effect
to the Arrangement.   (k) Canadian Tax Treatment. Neither BioChem nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall take any action which could reasonably be expected to
prevent the exchange by Canadian resident holders of BioChem Common Shares
for Exchangeable Shares from being treated as a tax deferred transaction for
purposes of the ITA to holders who are otherwise eligible for such
treatment.   (l) No Related Actions. BioChem will not, and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, agree or commit to any of the foregoing.   (m)

accordance with US GAAP, Accounting Principles Board Opinion 16 and
applicable SEC rules, regulations and policies and shall take no action that
would cause such accounting treatment not to be obtained.   4.3
Governmental Filings. Each party shall (a) confer on a regular and frequent
basis with the other and (b) report to the other (to the extent permitted by
law or regulation or any applicable confidentiality agreement) on operational

-39-   applicable confidentiality agreement) deliver to the other party
copies of all such reports, announcements and publications promptly after the

in this Agreement shall give BioChem, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Shire\'s operations prior to the Effective Date. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Shire, directly or indirectly, the

statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement").
The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Shire will provide BioChem with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
prior to filing such with the SEC, and will provide BioChem with a copy of
all such filings made with the SEC. Except as otherwise provided for herein,
no material amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the Proxy Statement shall be made by Shire without the approval
of BioChem, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Shire shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Shire shareholders
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Shire shall also

connection with the Arrangement. Shire will advise BioChem, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for material amendment to
the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Date any
information relating to Shire or BioChem, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Shire or BioChem
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or
regulations, an appropriate amendment or    -40-   supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of Shire.   (b) Shire shall prepare and file a registration
statement on Form S-3, or other available form under the rules of the SEC,
with respect to the Shire Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the

registration statement is required based on Section 3 (a) (9) or 3 (a) (10)
of the Securities Act and if such determination is obtained, before or after
the Effective Date, Shire shall have no further obligation under this Section
Preparation of Proxy Statement, Form S-3, CircularError! Not a valid bookmark
self-reference.. Shire shall use its best efforts to have the Form S-3
declared effective by the SEC prior to the Effective Date and shall keep the
Form S-3 effective while the Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding. Shire
shall cause the prospectus included in the Form S-3 to be mailed to the
holders of Exchangeable Shares as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Form S-3 is declared effective under the Securities Act and the Effective
Date.   (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, BioChem shall prepare and file with the OSC, the QSC and the other
Canadian provincial securities authorities, the Circular. The Circular shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Canadian Securities Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Except
as otherwise provided for herein, no material amendment or supplement
(including by incorporation by reference) to the Circular shall be made by
BioChem without the approval of Shire, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. BioChem will advise Shire, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of any request by the OSC, the QSC or any other
Canadian provincial securities authority for material amendment of the
Circular. If at any time prior to the Effective Date any information relating
to Shire or BioChem, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Shire or BioChem which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Circular so that the Circular would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the OSC, the QSC or
the other Canadian provincial securities authorities and disseminated to the
shareholders of BioChem.   (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, Shire shall prepare and, subject to the approval
of the UK Listing Authority and the LSE, issue the Listing Particulars and
the Class 1 Circular. The Listing Particulars and the Class 1 Circular shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Financial Services Act 1986, the rules and regulations thereunder, the
Listing Rules and the Rules of the LSE. Shire will provide BioChem with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Listing Particulars and
the Class 1 Circular prior to their issue, and will provide BioChem with a
copy of the Listing Particulars and the Class 1 Circular when they are
issued. Shire shall cause the Listing Particulars and the Class 1 Circular to
be mailed to the Shire shareholders and the BioChem shareholders as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Listing Particulars and the Class 1
Circular are approved by the UK Listing Authority and the    
-41-   LSE. Shire will advise BioChem as promptly as reasonably practicable
after it becomes aware that it may be required to issue supplementary listing
particulars pursuant to the Financial Services Act 1986. If at any time prior
to the Effective Date any information relating to Shire or BioChem, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Shire or BioChem which should be, or should have been, set forth in the
Listing Particulars and/or the Class 1 Circular so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or Shire or BioChem
should become aware of a significant change affecting any matter contained in
the Listing Particulars or the Class 1 Circular whose inclusion was required
by Section 146 of the Financial Services Act 1986 or by the Listing Rules, or
of a significant new matter the inclusion of information in respect of which
would have been so required if it had arisen when the Listing Particulars or
the Class 1 Circular were prepared, the party which discovers such
information or, as the case may be, becomes aware of any such significant
change or significant new matter, shall promptly notify the other party
hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations,
supplementary listing particulars shall promptly be issued and disseminated
to the shareholders of Shire and the shareholders of BioChem.   (e) BioChem
shall duly take (subject to the accuracy of the provisions of Section 3.1(e)
and Section 3.2(e) (provided that BioChem shall have used reasonable best
efforts to ensure that such representation is true and correct)), all lawful
action to call as promptly as practicable, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders on a date determined by BioChem (the "BioChem
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required BioChem Vote
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by
the Required BioChem Vote; and the Board of Directors of BioChem shall
recommend adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of BioChem to the
effect as set forth in Section 3.2(f) (the "BioChem Recommendation"), and
shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify) in any manner adverse to Shire such recommendation or take any
action or make any statement in connection with the BioChem Shareholders
Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the
BioChem Recommendation"); provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate
disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the
BioChem Recommendation) of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Shire or BioChem or the fact
that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making
such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (provided, that the
Board of Directors of BioChem does not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Shire its
recommendation) in the Circular, to the extent such information, facts,
identity or terms is required to be disclosed therein under applicable law,
rule or regulation; and, provided further, that the Board of Directors of
BioChem may make a Change in the BioChem Recommendation pursuant to Section
BioChem Acquisition Proposals hereof.   (f) Shire shall duly take (subject
to the accuracy of the provisions of Section 3.2(e) and Section 3.1(e))
(provided that Shire shall have used reasonable best efforts to ensure that
such representation is true and correct) all lawful action to call as
promptly as reasonably practicable, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders on a date     -42-   determined in
accordance with the mutual agreement of Shire and BioChem (the "Shire
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Shire Shareholders
Approval; and the Board of Directors of Shire shall recommend approval of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Arrangement by the
shareholders of Shire to the effect as set forth in Section 3.1(f) (the
"Shire Recommendation"), and shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to BioChem such
recommendation or take any action or make any statement in connection
with the Shire Shareholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (a
"Change in the Shire Recommendation"). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Shire may make a Change in the Shire
Recommendation in the circumstances contemplated in Section Shire Acquisition
Proposals hereof and in any other circumstances provided the Board of
Directors of Shire concludes in good faith (after receiving a written opinion
from outside counsel independent from Shire, a copy of which shall be
provided to BioChem) taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the circumstances as well as the
binding nature of the commitments, undertakings and covenants of Shire under
this Agreement, that the Board of Directors of Shire is required under such
Laws to make a Change in the Shire Recommendation in order to discharge its
fiduciary duties. The parties understand and agree that a variation of the
market price of the Shire ADSs or the Shire Ordinary Shares absent any
material change in BioChem shall not constitute a circumstance whereby the
Board of Directors of Shire may effect a Change in the
Shire Recommendation.   (g) For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the
BioChem Recommendation shall be deemed to include, without limitation, a
recommendation by the BioChem Board of Directors of a third party Acquisition
Proposal with respect to BioChem.   (h) For purposes of this Agreement, a
Change in the Shire Recommendation shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, a recommendation of the Shire Board of Directors of a third party
Shire Acquisition Proposal with respect to Shire.   (i) BioChem shall
inform Shire immediately of any new information in respect of Civil Action
No1=96-CV-1868 GET (the "Civil Action") regarding United States patent
5,539,116 to the extent permitted by Law. In the event that BioChem is
subject to an adverse ruling by the Federal Court of Justice in connection
with the Civil Action, BioChem agrees to make the appropriate application in
respect of the Civil Action to permit Shire to have access to
all confidential information in respect of such Civil Action unless
BioChem determines, acting reasonably, that such an application would likely
have a material adverse effect on its position in the context of the Civil
Action.   5.2 Shire Board of Directors. At or prior to the Effective Date,
Shire will use its reasonable efforts to reconstitute the Board of Directors
of Shire and the committees thereof as of the Effective Date in order that
the BioChem\'s nominees on the Board of Directors of Shire constitute 30% of
the directors of Shire.     -43-    5.3 Access to Information. Upon
reasonable notice, each party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives of the other party reasonable access during normal
business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Date, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers and employees
and, during such period, such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, published, announced or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of U.S.
federal or state securities laws or Canadian Securities Laws, as applicable
(other than documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law), and (b) all other information concerning it and its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request
(including consultation on a regular basis with respect to
litigation matters); provided, however, that either party may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that (i) any law, treaty, rule or regulation
of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or
its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information or (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations
to a third party. The parties will hold any such information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.3 in confidence in accordance with, and shall
otherwise be subject to, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements
dated October 3 and October 9, 2000, between BioChem and Shire (the
"Confidentiality Agreements"), as if such Confidentiality Agreement were in
full force and effect. Any investigation by Shire or BioChem shall not affect
the representations and warranties of BioChem or Shire, as the case may
be.   5.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
laws and regulations to consummate the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions,
filings, tax ruling requests and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,

or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Arrangement or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) taking all reasonable steps
as may be necessary to obtain all such material consents, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, securities and tax rulings, orders
and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, the CA, the ICA and any other Regulatory
Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested

take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the CA as soon as
practicable, and (iii) preparing and filing on a promptly as practicable
basis all     -44-   documentation to effect all necessary applications
notices, filings and to obtain all waivers and consents necessary or
advisable to be obtained from the QSC, OSC, the other Canadian provincial
securities authorities and the TSE, the NASDAQ and the LSE.   (b) Each of
Shire and BioChem shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.4(a) to obtain all requisite material approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the CA, the
ICA or any other Regulatory Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly
inform the other party of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Competition Bureau
under the CA (the "Competition Bureau"), the Minister responsible for the ICA
(the "ICA Authority") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the DOJ, the FTC, the Competition Bureau, the ICA Authority, or any
such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent appropriate or
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC, the Competition Bureau, the ICA Authority, or
such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
as amended, the CA, the ICA and all other federal, state and foreign, if
any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and
judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate (i) foreign investment or (ii) actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition.   (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained
in Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Shire and BioChem shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts in order to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Shire and BioChem shall use its
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such
Governmental Entity or private party may have to such   
-45-   transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
Section 5.4 shall limit a party\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Article VII.   5.5 BioChem Acquisition Proposals.   (a) Without
limitation on any of BioChem\'s other obligations under this Agreement
(including under Article IV hereof), BioChem agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or
its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to,
directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it, or any purchase or sale of
the consolidated assets (including without limitation shares of Subsidiaries)
of BioChem and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, having an aggregate value
equal to 50% or more of the market capitalization of BioChem, or any purchase
or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, 50% or more of the equity
securities of BioChem (any such proposal or offer (other than a proposal or
offer made by Shire or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as
an "Acquisition Proposal"). BioChem further agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to,
directly or indirectly, have any discussion with or provide any confidential
information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or

(iii) cause to be maintained for a period of six years after the Effective
Date the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance

aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Date;
provided, however, that in no event shall Shire be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by
BioChem for such insurance. The obligations of the Shire under this Section
5.8 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies without the consent
