ARTICLE I 
  
  THE MERGER

 

 

1.1. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, (a) at the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into L3 in accordance with the DGCL and the separate 
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) L3 shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving     Corporation_ ") and from and after the Effective Time (as
defined below), shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris (the " _Combined
Company_ ")     and the separate corporate existence of L3 with all of its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger as provided in the DGCL and (c) the Merger shall have
such other effects as provided in the  DGCL.

 

 

1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad  Street, New York, New
York 10004, at 9:00 a.m. (New York Time) on the third (3rd) Business Day

conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing (so long as such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied), but subject to the
satisfaction or  waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement or at such other date, time or place (or by
means of remote communication) as L3 and Harris may mutually agree in writing
(the date on which the Closing  actually occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following, and on the date of,
the Closing, L3 and Harris will cause a certificate of merger relating to the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in
Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when
the  Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with and accepted by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as
may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (such date and time,  the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

 

ARTICLE II 
  
  MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

 

2.1. _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares of L3 Common Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of L3, each share of L3 
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than Excluded Shares (such shares of L3 Common Stock, the " _Eligible
Shares_ ")     shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for 1.30
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Harris Common Stock (such number of
shares of Harris Common  Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all Excluded Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no payment shall be made  in respect of such shares.

 

 

 

\- 2 -  


 

 

2.2. _Conversion of Shares of L3 Common Stock_. By virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any capital
stock of L3, all of the Eligible Shares shall represent the right to receive 
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each  certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account formerly representing
any  non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
the  right, if any, to receive pursuant to _Section 3.5_ cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant
to this _Section 2.2_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.3_; _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement (including this
_Article II_ and _Article III_) shall (a) affect the right of the holders of
shares of L3 Common Stock to receive any dividend or other distribution which
was declared on L3 Common Stock, and the record date of  which occurred,
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement or (b) give holders of L3 Common Stock the right to receive any
dividend or other distribution declared on Harris Common Stock and for which
the record  date occurred prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

2.3. _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to 
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the  Effective Time.

 

 

2.4. _Treatment of Equity Awards_. Except as disclosed in _Section 2.4_ of
such Party's Disclosure Letter, this _Section 2.4_ shall govern the treatment
of such Party's equity awards in connection with the Transactions.

 

 

(a) _L3 Option_ s. At the Effective Time, any  service-based or performance-
based vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding option to purchase
shares of L3 Common Stock under the L3 Stock Plans (a " _L3  Option_ ") shall
be deemed satisfied and accelerated in full and each L3 Option shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to represent an option to purchase shares of L3 Common Stock and shall  be
converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Harris Common Stock
(such option, a " _Converted L3 Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded 
down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of L3 Common
Stock subject to such L3 Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent)  equal to (A) the exercise price per share of L3 Common
Stock of such L3 Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided_ _by_
(B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the  exercise price and
the number of shares of Harris Common Stock purchasable pursuant to Converted
L3 Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
Converted L3 Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the  number of shares of Harris Common Stock purchasable pursuant
to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject
to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code.  Except as specifically provided

 

 

 

\- 3 -  

above, following the Effective Time, each Converted L3 Option shall continue
to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including, as applicable, 
exercisability and forfeiture terms) as were applicable to the corresponding
former L3 Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect
to any "change in control" provisions under the applicable award agreement, L3
Stock Plan or  other document governing the corresponding former L3 Option,
which provisions shall be deemed triggered as a result of the Transactions.

 

 

(b) _L3 RSU_ _s_. At the Effective Time, any  vesting conditions applicable
to each outstanding restricted stock unit granted under the L3 Stock Plans (a
" _L3 RSU_ ") shall be deemed satisfied and  accelerated in full and each L3
RSU shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such L3 RSU to
receive, within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date  and
subject to _Section 3.8_, a number of shares of Harris Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares
of L3 Common  Stock subject to such L3 RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the  Exchange Ratio.

 

 

(c) _L3 PSUs_. Each outstanding performance unit  granted under the L3 Stock
Plans (a " _L3 PSU_ ") shall entitle the holder to receive a number of shares
of Harris Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.4(c)(i)_ and a Converted
L3 PSU Award in accordance with _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_ , in each  case, with
respect to a number of shares of L3 Common Stock based on the greater of the
target and actual level of performance through the Effective Time (the "
_Earned    L3 PSUs_ "), as reasonably determined by the compensation
committee of the L3 Board (the " _L3 Compensation Committee_ ") at least three
(3)  Business Days prior to the Effective Time after consultation with Harris
regarding such performance determination.

 

 

(i) At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions  applicable to a portion of
the Earned L3 PSUs equal to the product of (A) the Earned L3 PSUs and (B) the
L3 Pro Ration Factor (such portion of the Earned L3 PSUs, the " _Settled L3
PSUs_ ") shall be deemed satisfied and accelerated in full and each Settled L3
PSU shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof  to receive,
within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date and subject to
_Section 3.8_ , a number of shares of Harris Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded  to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of shares of L3
Common Stock subject to such Settled L3 PSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio; and

 

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Earned L3 PSU that is not  a Settled L3 PSU
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into a time-vested restricted stock unit

Award_ "). The number of shares of Harris Common Stock subject to each
Converted L3 PSU Award shall equal the product (rounded to the nearest whole
number) of (A)  the number of shares of L3 Common Stock subject to such
Converted L3 PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Each Converted L3 PSU Award will be subject to the same terms

any "change in control" provisions under the applicable award  agreement, L3

shall be deemed triggered as a result of the Transactions.

cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such L3 Deferred Director Award

subject to _Section 3.8_ , a number of shares of Harris Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded to  the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of
shares of L3 Common Stock subject to such L3 Deferred Director Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the Exchange
Ratio.

 

 

(e) _L3 Other Awards_. At the Effective Time, each  right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of L3 Common Stock or

converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the value
of (as applicable)  the number of shares of Harris Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of
L3 Common Stock subject to such L3 Other Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange  Ratio, and to the extent such L3 Other
Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the shares of L3 Common
Stock exceed a specified reference price, at a reference price per share
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the  reference price per
share of L3 Common Stock of such L3 Other Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time _divided_ _by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each such right or award shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including, as
applicable, vesting and  exercisability terms) as were applicable to such
right or award under the relevant L3 Stock Plan or other L3 Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any "change in
control" provisions under the applicable award  agreement, L3 Stock Plan or
other document governing such right or award, which provisions shall be deemed
triggered as a result of the Transactions.

 

 

(f) _L3 Dividend Equivalent Rights_. Any L3 dividend  equivalent rights
associated with any L3 RSU, L3 PSU, L3 Deferred Director Award or L3 Other
Award shall either be paid in cash or treated in the same manner as the award
to which such dividend equivalent rights relate in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_ , in each case, pursuant to the terms of the relevant L3 Stock
Plan or other L3 Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, after
giving effect to any  "change in control" provisions under the applicable

the holder thereof, be deemed satisfied and accelerated in full, (ii) any

any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding performance share unit
granted under the Harris Stock Plans (a " _Harris PSU_ ") shall, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed satisfied
and accelerated in full with respect to a number of  shares of Harris Common
Stock based on the greater of the target and actual level of performance
through the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation
committee of the Harris Board at least three (3) Business Days prior to the 
Effective Time after consultation with L3 regarding such performance
determination. Any Harris dividend equivalent rights associated with any

2.4(a)_  through _Section 2.4(e)_ , and (ii) provide for the deduction,
withholding and remittance of any amounts required pursuant to _Section 3.8_.
L3 shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time, neither Harris nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver shares of L3 Common Stock or other  capital stock of L3 to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of L3 Equity Awards.

 

 

 

\- 6 -  

 

(j) _Harris Actions_. Harris shall take all actions  that are necessary for

reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as the relevant L3 Stock Plans or other L3 Benefit
Plans, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests 
therein or the shares of Harris Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to
be required. As soon as reasonably practicable after the registration of such
interests or shares, as applicable, appropriate notices shall be given to the

the respective L3 Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such L3
Equity Awards, and stating that such L3 Equity Awards and agreements have been
assumed by Harris and shall  continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 2.4_ after
giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the L3  Stock Plans).

 

 

(k) _Future Grants of Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding  anything in _Section
2.4(a)_ through _Section 2.4(h)_ to the contrary, but subject to _Section

Award granted on or after the date of this Agreement and not in violation of
this Agreement  expressly provide for treatment in connection with the
occurrence of the Effective Time that is different from the treatment
prescribed by this _Section 2.4_ , or (ii) as  mutually agreed by the Parties
and a holder of any L3 Equity Award or Harris Equity Award, then in each case,

qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

Stock to be issued in non-certificated book-entry form  sufficient to deliver
the number of shares of Harris Common Stock required to be delivered in

if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled  pursuant to
_Section 3.2(a)_ with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time
and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares. Such shares of Harris
Common  Stock, cash and the amount of any dividends or other distributions
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.1_, being the "
_Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of
the Exchange Fund may  be deposited by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Harris; _provided_ , that no such deposit or investment (or any
loss resulting therefrom) shall affect the cash  payable to former holders of
L3 Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Any interest
and other income resulting from such deposit may become part of  the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be promptly returned to Harris.

 

 

3.2. _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

 

(a) With respect to Certificates, as promptly as reasonably  practicable
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of each such Certificate (i) a notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a letter of 
transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the

lieu of a Certificate as provided in _Section 3.7_) to the Exchange Agent.
Upon surrender to the  Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of a Certificate as provided in _Section 3.7_ ) together with a duly
executed and completed Letter of  Transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
any such Certificate in exchange therefore, as promptly  as reasonably
practicable thereafter, (A) a statement reflecting the number of whole shares
of Harris Common Stock, if any, that such holder is entitled to receive in
non-certificated book-entry form pursuant to _Article II_ in the name of such
record holder and (B) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.8_) of (x) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares _plus_ (y) any unpaid cash dividends and any other
dividends or other distributions that  such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. Any Certificate that has been so surrendered
shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 

 

(b) With respect to Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC  (each, a " _Non_
_-_ _DTC Book-Entry Share_ "), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Non-DTC Book-Entry Share (i)  a notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a statement
reflecting the number of whole shares of Harris Common Stock, if any, that
such holder is entitled to receive in non-certificated book-entry form
pursuant to _Article II_ in the name of such record holder and (iii) a check
in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.8_) of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares _plus_
(B) any

 

 

 

\- 8 -  


 

 

unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

 

(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, L3  and Harris shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure
that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as
reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of
Eligible  Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with
DTC's customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Harris Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid cash
dividends and any other dividends  or other distributions, in each case, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

 

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount  payable for Eligible
Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

 

3.3. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of L3 Common Stock;
Voting_. All shares of Harris Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever 
a dividend or other distribution is declared by Harris in respect of Harris
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares issuable  pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Harris Common Stock shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of a Certificate as  provided in _Section 3.7_) is surrendered
for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_.  Subject to applicable
Law, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole shares
of Harris Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance
with this _Article III_, without interest, (a) at the time of such surrender,
the dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Harris
Common  Stock and not paid, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Harris Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time and
prior to surrender but with a  payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

 

3.4. _No Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of L3 of the shares of L3 Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after  the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of L3 Common Stock
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates  are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

 

3.5. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fractional shares of Harris Common Stock will be issued upon the
conversion of shares of L3 Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_. All
fractional shares of Harris Common Stock that a holder of Eligible Shares
would be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_, but for this
_Section 3.5_ , shall be aggregated and such holder shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment, without interest, in  lieu of any such fractional
share, equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest cent) of (a) the
amount of such fractional share interest in a share

 

 

 

\- 9 -  


 

 

of Harris Common Stock to which such holder would, but for this _Section 3.5_
, be entitled under _Section 2.1_ , and (b) an amount equal to the average of
the daily volume weighted average price per share of Harris Common Stock on
the NYSE (as such daily volume weighted  average price per share is reported
by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Harris and L3) calculated for the five (5) consecutive
Trading Days ending on the second (2nd) full  Trading Day immediately prior
to (and not including) the Closing Date. No holder of Eligible Shares shall be
entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Harris Common Stock described in this _Section 3.5_ to any dividends,
voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Harris
Common Stock. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of  Harris
Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

 

 

3.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any deposit of the Exchange Fund and any shares of
Harris Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the one hundred eightieth
(180th)  day after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Harris. Any
holder of Eligible Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only  to Harris for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Harris Common Stock, if
any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions, in each case, that such holder has the right to  receive
pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

 

3.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or  destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for  such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Harris Common
Stock, if any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions, in each case, payable or issuable  pursuant to this _Article
III_, as if such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate had been surrendered.

 

 

3.8. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Harris and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of L3 Common Stock, L3 
Equity Awards and Harris Equity Awards, such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so  withheld by Harris or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely remitted by Harris or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all  purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of L3 Common Stock, L3 Equity Awards
and Harris Equity Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Harris or the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

3.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with _Article X_, the
issued and outstanding shares of L3

 

 

 

\- 10 -  


 

 

Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of L3 Common Stock or the issued and outstanding shares of Harris
Common Stock or securities  convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Harris Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or securities or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse  stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date
within such period shall have been declared, then the Merger Consideration 
shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of shares of L3 Common
Stock and Harris Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of  such event, be the Merger Consideration. Nothing in this
_Section 3.9_ shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action
except to the extent consistent with, and  not otherwise prohibited by, the
terms of this Agreement.

 

 

3.10. _No Liability_. None of L3, Harris, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to  any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven
(7) years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any shares of Harris  Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Harris Common Stock and any unpaid cash dividends and any other
dividends or other distributions, in each case, that a holder of any Eligible
Shares has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_ in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or 
other distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Harris, free
and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

procedures and of financial reporting controls and procedures described above
are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the
exclusive ownership  and direct control of such Party or a wholly owned

systems of disclosure controls and  procedures and of financial reporting
controls and procedures or the reports generated thereby.

chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of
this Agreement, to such Party's auditors and the audit committee of the board

auditors and the  audit committee of the board of directors of such Party any
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in  such Party's internal control over financial
reporting. Since the Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
concerns from such Party's employees regarding  questionable accounting or
auditing matters, have been received by such Party. Since the Applicable Date,
no attorney representing such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported  evidence of
a material violation of securities Laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by such Party or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to such Party's chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee

307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or such Party's policy contemplating such
reporting, including in instances not required by those rules.

receive shares of L3 Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by

respect thereto and the exercise price (if any). Each of the outstanding
shares of  capital stock or other securities of each of L3's Subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of L3's
Significant Subsidiaries is  owned by L3 or by a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of L3, free and clear of any Encumbrance. As of the date of

of this Agreement, L3 has not (A) issued any shares of L3 Common Stock (other
than upon the exercise or settlement of L3 Equity  Awards outstanding as of
October 10, 2018, or in connection with matching contributions to L3's 401(k)
Plans in accordance with the terms of the plan documents) or (B) granted any

\- 35 -  


 

 

obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders
of L3 on any matter.

 

 

6.5. _L3 Recommendation and Fairness_. In the case of L3, the L3 Board has, at
a meeting duly called and held at which all directors of L3 were present, duly
and unanimously adopted resolutions (a) determining that this Agreement  and
the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, L3 and the holders
of shares of L3 Common Stock, (b) approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, (c) directing that this
Agreement be  submitted to the holders of shares of L3 Common Stock for their
adoption, and (d) resolving to recommend that the holders of shares of L3
Common Stock adopt this Agreement (the " _L3 Recommendation_ "), which
resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any
way, except as may be permitted by _Section     8.2(d)(ii)_. The L3 Board
has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, to
the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set  forth therein, the Exchange
Ratio is fair from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion,
to the holders of the outstanding shares of L3 Common Stock (other than Harris
and its Affiliates).

 

 

6.6. _L3 Brokers and Finders_. Neither L3 nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or

in connection with the Transactions, except that L3 has engaged Goldman Sachs
and Co. LLC as its financial advisor, the fees and expenses of which will be
paid by L3.

 

 

6.7. _Spin-Off Tax Issues_. To the Knowledge of Harris as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the merger of Harris Communication Solutions (Indiana),
Inc. with and into Exelis Inc. nor any subsequent transaction related to
such  merger was reasonably likely to result in the application of Section
355(e) of the Code to the distribution of Vectrus, Inc. by Exelis Inc.

(a) _No Solicitation_. Except as expressly permitted  by this _Section 8.2_,
L3 and Harris each shall not, and none of their respective Subsidiaries shall,

discussions solely to clarify whether such proposal or offer constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal);

 

 

(iii) provide any nonpublic information to any Person in  connection with any

\- 42 -  


 

 

Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement (that did not
arise from or in connection with a breach of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 8.2_), L3 or Harris, as applicable, may:

 

 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor  (including
nonpublic information regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries) to the Person
who made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such information has
previously  been made available to, or is made available to, L3 or Harris, as
applicable, prior to or concurrently with the time such information is made
available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such information,
L3 or Harris, as applicable,  receives from the Person making such

the Person making such Acquisition Proposal is a known competitor of  L3 or
Harris, as applicable, L3 or Harris, as applicable, shall not provide any

any actions permitted by this _Section 8.2(b)_ other than in accordance with
customary "clean room" or other similar procedures designed to limit the
disclosure of competitively sensitive information; and

 

 

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with  any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 

 

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the L3 Board or the Harris Board, as applicable,
determines  in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that (A) based on the information then available and after consultation with
its financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably  be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and (B) failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

 

(c) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. L3 and Harris  each shall promptly
(and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) give notice to the other
Party if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, (ii) any information is requested in connection 
with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives, setting forth in such notice

proposals or offers (including, if applicable, complete copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep the other Party informed, on a  current basis (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such

of any such discussions or negotiations, including any  change in its
intentions as previously notified.

 

 

(d) _No Change of Recommendation_.

 

 

(i) Except as permitted by _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ and _Section 8.2(e)_, each of
the L3 Board and the Harris Board, including any committee thereof, agrees 
it shall not:

 

 

 

\- 43 -  

 

(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly  propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the L3 Recommendation or the Harris
Recommendation, as applicable, in a manner adverse to L3 or Harris, as
applicable;

 

 

(B) fail to include the L3 Recommendation or the Harris  Recommendation, as
applicable, in the Proxy/Prospectus;

 

 

(C) fail to (x) reaffirm the L3 Recommendation or Harris  Recommendation, as
applicable, and (y) recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer
by its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for
outstanding shares of L3 Common Stock or Harris Common Stock, as applicable 
(other than by L3 or an Affiliate of L3 or Harris or an Affiliate of Harris,
as applicable), in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier, prior to
the L3 Stockholders  Meeting or Harris Stockholders Meeting, as applicable);

 

 

(D) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or  publicly propose
to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a 
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 8.2(b)_ entered into in
compliance with _Section 8.2(b)_)  relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ", and any of the actions set forth in the
foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C)  and (D), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ");
or

 

 

(E) cause or permit L3 or Harris, as applicable, to enter  into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, prior to
the time, in the case of L3, the Requisite L3 Vote is obtained or, in the case
of Harris, the Requisite Harris Vote is obtained, the L3 Board or the Harris
Board, as applicable, may effect a Change of Recommendation if (A)(1) an 
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the date of
this Agreement that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of the 
obligations set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ is received by L3 or Harris, as
applicable, and is not withdrawn, and the L3 Board or the Harris Board, as
applicable, determines  in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) an Intervening Event has occurred, and
(B) the L3 Board or Harris Board, as applicable,  determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior
Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, would be  inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , 
that a Change of Recommendation may not be made unless and until L3 has given
Harris or Harris has given L3, as applicable, written notice of such action
and the basis therefor four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice shall
set forth in  writing that the L3 Board or the Harris Board, as applicable,
intends to consider whether to take such action and (x) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, comply in form, substance and delivery with the provisions
of _Section 8.2(c)_ and (y) in the case of an Intervening Event, include a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event (such notice, the "
_Board Recommendation Notice_ "). After giving such Board Recommendation
Notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation, L3 or Harris,

 

 

 

\- 44 -  


 

 

as applicable, shall negotiate in good faith with the other Party (to the
extent the other Party wishes to negotiate), to make such revisions to the
terms of this Agreement as would  permit the L3 Board or the Harris Board, as
applicable, not to effect a Change of Recommendation in response thereto. At
the end of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to
taking action to effect a Change of  Recommendation, the L3 Board or the
Harris Board, as applicable, shall take into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by the other Party and any other
information offered by the other Party in response to the Board 
Recommendation Notice, and shall have determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that (I)
in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior  Proposal and, in the case of an Intervening Event,
that such Intervening Event remains in effect and (II) the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening
Event, as applicable, would be  inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, in each case, if such changes offered in writing
by the other Party were to be given effect. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new  Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of _Section 8.2(c)_ and this _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ except that 
references in this _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ to "four (4) Business Days" shall be
deemed to be references to "two (2) Business Days."

 

 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained  in this _Section 8.2_
shall prohibit L3 or Harris, as applicable, from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard
to  an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Harris nor L3 may effect
a Change of Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_.

 

 

(f) _Existing Discussions_. L3 and Harris each shall,  and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person  conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.
L3 and Harris, as applicable, shall promptly deliver a written notice to each
such Person providing  only that each of L3 and Harris, as applicable, is
ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or proposal or transaction that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,  which notice shall also request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information concerning L3
and any of its Subsidiaries or Harris and any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of  L3 or
Harris, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable.
L3 and Harris, as applicable, will promptly terminate all physical and
electronic data access previously granted to such Persons.

 

 

(g) _Standstill Provisions_. During the period  commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and the 
Effective Time, L3 and Harris, as applicable, shall not terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which L3 and Harris, as applicable, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a  party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the provisions of any

 

 

 

\- 45 -  


 

 

such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.

Harris shall prepare and file with the SEC the joint proxy statement relating
to the L3 Stockholders Meeting and the Harris Stockholders Meeting (as amended
or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy/Prospectus_ "), and Harris
shall prepare and file with the SEC, Harris' registration statement on Form
S‑4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Registration
Statement_ ", with the Proxy/Prospectus constituting a part thereof). L3 and
Harris each shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond  promptly to
comments from the SEC and have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, to

(b) Each of L3 and Harris shall promptly notify the other of  the receipt of
all comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus or for
additional information and shall promptly provide to the other copies of all 
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC with
respect to the Registration Statement or Proxy/Prospectus. Each of Harris and
L3  shall advise the other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the
time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the issuance of any stop
order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of shares of
Harris Common Stock  for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of
Harris and L3 shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop
order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Harris shall
also use its reasonable best efforts to  take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified
on the date of this Agreement) required to be taken under any applicable
securities Laws, rules or regulations in connection with the  Transactions,
the issuance of shares of Harris Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and
the treatment of L3 Options and other L3 Equity Awards pursuant to _Section
2.4_, and L3 shall furnish all information concerning L3 and the holders of L3
Common Stock, L3 and other L3 Equity Awards as  may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action.

 

 

(c) Each of L3 and Harris agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none
of the information  supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement  of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy/Prospectus and any  amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the stockholders of L3 and
Harris and at the times of the L3 Stockholders Meeting and Harris Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. L3 and Harris will cause

 

 

 

\- 46 -  


 

 

the Proxy/Prospectus and Harris will cause the Registration Statement to
comply as to  form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, either Party obtains knowledge of any information
pertaining to it or  previously provided by it for inclusion in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus that would require any
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus
so that any of such documents would not include any  untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, such Party shall promptly advise the other Party 
and the Parties shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement and, as required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such  amendment or supplement to the L3 stockholders and the
Harris  stockholder.

 

 

(d) Each of L3 and Harris will provide their respective legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to  review and comment on drafts of the
Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement, responses to any comments from
the SEC with respect thereto, and other documents related to the L3
Stockholders Meeting, the Harris Stockholders Meeting or the issuance of the
shares of Harris Common Stock in respect of the Merger, prior to filing such
documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such documents
to the stockholders of L3 and Harris, as applicable. Each Party will include
in  the Proxy/Prospectus, the Registration Statement and such other documents
related to the L3 Stockholders Meeting, the Harris Stockholders Meeting or the
issuance of the shares of Harris Common Stock  in respect of the Merger with
all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other Party or its legal
counsel and each agrees that all information relating to Harris and its
Subsidiaries included in the Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration Statement
shall be in form and content satisfactory to Harris,  acting reasonably, and
all information relating to L3 and its Subsidiaries included in the
Proxy/Prospectus and the Registration Statement shall be in  form and content
satisfactory to L3, acting reasonably. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall (i) not apply with respect to
information relating to Change of Recommendation and (ii) in respect of
documents filed by a Party that are incorporated by reference in the 
Registration Statement or Proxy/Prospectus, apply only with respect to the
information relating to the other Party or the other Party's business,
financial condition or results of operations or the Combined Company.

 

 

8.4. _Stockholders Meetings_.

 

 

(a) L3 will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational
Documents, all action necessary to convene the L3 Stockholders Meeting as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective, and in any event (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) within
thirty (30) Business Days thereafter to consider and  vote upon the adoption
of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall not postpone
or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law, in accordance
with _Section     8.4(c)_ , or if, as of the time for which the L3
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy/Prospectus),  there are insufficient shares of L3 Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to adopt this Agreement
or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the L3
Stockholders Meeting. L3 shall, subject to the  right of the L3 Board to
effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ ,
use

 

 

 

\- 47 -  


 

 

reasonable best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of L3 proxies in
favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement and to secure the Requisite L3
Vote (it being understood that  the foregoing shall not require the L3 Board
to recommend in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if a Change of
Recommendation has been effected in accordance with _Section  8.2(d)(ii)_ ).

 

 

(b) Harris will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational
Documents, all action necessary to convene the Harris Stockholders Meeting as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective, and in any event (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) within
thirty (30) Business Days thereafter to consider  and vote upon the issuance
of shares of Harris Common Stock in the Merger and the approval of the Charter
Amendment and to cause such vote to be  taken, and shall not postpone or
adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law, in accordance with
_Section 8.4(c)_ or if, as of the time for which the Harris Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy/Prospectus), there
are insufficient shares of Harris Common Stock  represented (either in person
or by proxy) and voting to approve the Share Issuance or the Charter
Amendment, as applicable, to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Harris Stockholders Meeting. Harris shall, subject to the 
right of the Harris Board to effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ , use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
stockholders of  Harris proxies in favor of the Share Issuance and the
Charter Amendment and to secure the Requisite Harris Vote (it being understood
that the foregoing shall not require the Harris Board to recommend in favor of
the Share Issuance and the Charter  Amendment, if a Change of Recommendation
has been effected in accordance with _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ ).

 

 

(c) L3 and Harris shall cooperate to schedule and convene  the L3
Stockholders Meeting and the Harris Stockholders Meeting on the same date. L3
and Harris each agrees (i) to provide the other reasonably detailed periodic
updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including,
if  requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the last ten (10)
days prior to the applicable stockholder meeting) and (ii) to give written
notice to the other Party one (1) day prior to the L3 Stockholders Meeting or
the Harris Stockholders  Meeting, as applicable, and on the day of, but prior
to the L3 Stockholders Meeting or the Harris Stockholders Meeting, as
applicable, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies representing
the Requisite L3 Vote or the Requisite Harris  Vote, as applicable, have been
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date that is two (2)
Business Days prior to the date the L3 Stockholders Meeting or the Harris
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, is scheduled (in either case, the "
_Original Date_ "), (A) L3 or Harris, as applicable, has not received proxies
representing the Requisite L3 Vote or the Requisite Harris Vote, as
applicable,  whether or not a quorum is present or (B) it is necessary to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy/Prospectus is required to
be delivered, L3 may, or if Harris so requests, shall, or Harris may, or if L3
so requests, shall, postpone  or adjourn, or make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of, the L3 Stockholders Meeting or the Harris
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, as long as the date of the L3
Stockholders Meeting or the Harris Stockholders Meeting, as  applicable, is
not postponed or adjourned more than ten (10) days in connection with any one
postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of twenty (20) Business
Days from the Original Date in reliance on this sentence. In the event that 
L3 or Harris, as applicable, postpones or adjourns the L3 Stockholders Meeting
or the Harris Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, the other Party may
postpone or adjourn its stockholders meeting such

 

 

 

\- 48 -  


 

 

that the L3 Stockholders Meeting and the Harris Stockholders Meeting are
scheduled on the same date.

 

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each  of L3 and Harris
agrees that its obligations to hold the L3 Stockholders Meeting and the Harris
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ shall 
not be affected by the making of a Change of Recommendation by the L3 Board or
the Harris Board, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this _Section
8.4_ shall not  be affected by the commencement of or announcement or
disclosure of or communication to L3 or Harris, as applicable, of any
Acquisition Proposal (including any Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or
disclosure of an Intervening Event as to L3 or  Harris, as applicable.

 

 

(e) The only matters to be voted upon at the L3 Stockholders  Meeting and the
Harris Stockholders Meeting are (i) in the case of L3, the Requisite L3 Vote
and routine proposals required in connection with such vote and (ii) in the
case of Harris, the Requisite Harris Vote and routine proposals required in 
connection with such vote.

connection with the Transactions (including the Proxy/Prospectus). Neither L3
nor Harris shall permit any of its officers or other Representatives to
participate in any substantive meeting  with any Governmental Entity in

take or cause to be taken the following actions:

 

 

(i) subject to applicable Law, the prompt provision to each  and every
federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law (each, a "
_Governmental  Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-privileged information and
documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions;

 

 

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take  all reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable steps to (A) avoid the entry of, and (B)
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove any
actual, anticipated or threatened temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction or  other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment
entered or issued, or that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or
issued, in any Proceeding or inquiry of any kind, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), that  would reasonably be expected to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make unlawful the
consummation of the Transactions, including the defense through litigation
(excluding any appeals) on the merits of any claim asserted in  any court,
agency or other Proceeding by any person or entity (including any Governmental
Antitrust Entity) seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Transactions and the proffer and agreement by L3
or  Harris, as applicable, of its willingness to sell, lease, license or
otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly
to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate of, assets,
operations, rights,  product lines, licenses, businesses or interests therein
of L3 or Harris or either of their respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental
Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto)  (such sale, lease, license, disposal
and holding separate, a " _Regulatory Remedy_ ") if such Regulatory Remedy
should be reasonably necessary, proper or  advisable so as to permit the
consummation of the Transactions on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated herein.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.6_ to the contrary, neither
this _Section 8.6_ nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard  herein shall
require, or be construed to require, L3 or Harris or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to (i) waive any of the conditions set forth
in _Article IX_  as they apply to such Party, (ii) take, effect or agree to
any Regulatory Remedy unless such Regulatory Remedy is conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing or is effective on or after the Closing or (iii)
take, effect or agree to any  Regulatory Remedy that individually or in the
aggregate with any other Regulatory Remedy to be taken, effected or agreed to,
would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the condition

results of operations of L3, Harris and their Subsidiaries (taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the  Merger), it being understood that for purposes of
clause (iii) any proceeds received, or expected to be received, from effecting
a Regulatory Remedy shall not be taken into consideration in making such
determination.

 

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, L3 and Harris shall  cooperate with each
other and work in good faith in formulating any Regulatory Remedy.

Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. L3  and Harris each shall give prompt notice to the
other of any change, fact or condition that has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such Party, or of any failure
of any condition to the other Party's  obligations to effect the Merger to be
satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to comply with this sentence of this
_Section 8.7_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 9.2(b)_   or _Section 9.3(b)_ to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this sentence of this
_Section 8.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the  remedies available
under this Agreement to the other Party.

 

 

8.8. _Financing and Indebtedness_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Parties hereto shall cooperate in good
faith to mutually determine and implement any necessary, appropriate or

8.9_, L3 and Harris each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning

their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions, and shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to), upon giving of reasonable notice by the other  Party, afford the other
Party's officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours following reasonable advance notice throughout
the period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers, Employees, agents, 
Contracts, books and records (including the work papers of such Party's
independent accountants upon receipt of any required consents from such
accountants), as well as properties, offices and other facilities, and, during
such period, each shall  (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the other all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested.

 

 

 

\- 51 -  


 

 

(b) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.9_ shall not require and shall
not be construed to require either L3 or Harris to permit any access to any of
its officers, Employees, agents, Contracts, books or  records, or its
properties, offices or other facilities, or to permit any inspection, review,
sampling or audit, or to disclose or otherwise make available any information
that in the reasonable judgment of L3 or Harris, as applicable, would  (i)
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third parties,
competitively sensitive information, information concerning the valuation of
L3, Harris or any of their respective Subsidiaries or violate the terms of any
confidentiality  provisions in any agreement with a third party entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) result in a violation of applicable
Law, including any fiduciary duty, (iii) waive the protection of any
attorney‑client privilege, (iv) result in  the disclosure of any personal
information that would expose the Party to the risk of liability or (v) result
in the disclosure of classified information or access to cleared facilities in
violation of NISPOM. In the event that L3 or Harris, as  applicable, objects
to any request submitted pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 8.9_
and withholds information on the basis of the foregoing clauses (i)  through
(v), L3 or Harris, as applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the
general nature of what is being withheld and L3 and Harris shall use
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable  disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing
impediments, including through the use of reasonable best efforts to (A)
obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide
such information and (B) implement  appropriate and mutually agreeable
measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove
the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean
room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint  defense agreement
with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine
that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information
without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Each of L3
and  Harris, as it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate
competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel
Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall  be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be
subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between
the Parties. All requests for information made pursuant to  this _Section
8.9_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by
L3 or Harris, as applicable. All information exchanged or made available
shall  be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

(c) To the extent that any of the information or material  furnished pursuant
to this _Section 8.9_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege,
work  product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, including those
concerning pending or threatened Proceedings, the Parties understand and agree
that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it
is their desire,  intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such
material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the
confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product  doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,  this
Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

 

 

(d) No exchange of information or investigation by Harris or  its
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the
representations and

 

 

 

\- 52 -  


 

 

warranties of L3 set forth in this Agreement, and no investigation by L3 or
its Representatives shall affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the
representations and warranties  of Harris or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement.

faith to identify a ticker symbol for the Combined Company from and after the
Closing. Prior to the Closing Date, L3 shall cooperate with Harris and use
reasonable best  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable
the delisting by the Surviving  Corporation of the shares of L3 Common Stock

comment by the other Party, prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making planned public statements with respect to the Transactions and prior to
making any  filings with any third party or any Governmental Entity
(including the NYSE) with respect thereto, except (i) as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of the NYSE, (ii) any consultation  that would not be reasonably
practicable as a result of requirements of applicable Law, (iii) with respect
to any Change of Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement or L3's
or Harris' response thereto or any action taken by Harris or  the Harris
Board or L3 or the L3 Board, as applicable, pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 8.2_ , (iv) in connection with any dispute between the Parties
regarding  this Agreement or the Transaction or (v) to the extent the content
of any such disclosure, announcement or statement is consistent with any
previous disclosure, announcement or statement made in accordance with this
Agreement. Each of L3 and Harris  may make any public statements in response
to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or analyst or investor conference calls, so long as such
statements are not inconsistent with previous statements made  jointly by L3
and Harris.

or its Subsidiaries (the " _Harris Continuing Employees_ ")  shall, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2019,
be provided with base salary or base wage, severance benefit protections, and
pension and welfare benefits (subject to those exclusions set forth on

favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such L3 Continuing
Employees or Harris Continuing  Employees, as applicable, immediately prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the requirements of this
sentence shall not apply to

 

 

 

\- 53 -  


 

 

L3 Continuing Employees or Harris Continuing Employees who are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

 

 

(b) With respect to any Benefit Plan in which any L3  Continuing Employee or
Harris Continuing Employee (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
first becomes eligible to participate on or after the  Effective Time, each

conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any of its
group health plans to be waived with respect to the other Party's  Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give the other Party's
Continuing Employees credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time

eligible to  participate in the applicable Benefit Plan, if later) towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses
incurred during the plan year but prior to the Effective Time (or eligibility
date, as applicable), for which  payment has been made and (iii) give the
other Party's Continuing Employees service credit for such Continuing
Employee's employment with the other Party for purposes of vesting, benefit
accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable  Benefit Plan,
as if such service had been performed with such Party, except for benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for
subsidized early retirement benefits (unless otherwise required under
applicable  Law) or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

 

(c) Prior to making any material written communications to  the executive
officers of L3 or Harris pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party
shall provide the other Party with a copy of the intended communication, the
other  Party shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on

good faith.

 

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i)  be treated as an
amendment of any particular L3 Benefit Plan or Harris Benefit Plan, (ii)
prevent L3, Harris, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from
amending or terminating any of their respective Benefit Plans in accordance
with  their terms, (iii) prevent L3, Harris, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment
of any L3 Continuing Employee or Harris Continuing Employee or (iv) create any
third-party  beneficiary rights in any Employee of L3, Harris or any of their

8.13. _Taxation_.

 

 

(a) None of Harris, L3 or any of their respective  Subsidiaries shall take or
cause to be taken, or fail to take, any action, whether before or after the

Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of  Section
368(a) of the Code.

 

 

 

\- 54 -  

 

(b) Harris shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver  to Sullivan and
Cromwell LLP, counsel to Harris (" _Harris ' Counsel_"), and Simpson Thacher and

(c) In connection with the satisfaction of the condition set  forth in
_Section 9.2(e)_, Harris agrees that if Harris receives a Change in Law
Opinion from Harris' Counsel, it shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a
Tax-Free  Opinion from an alternative tax counsel of similar standing. In
connection with the satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section
9.3(f)_ , L3 agrees that if L3  receives a Change in Law Opinion from L3's
Counsel, it shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a Tax-Free Opinion
from an alternative tax counsel of similar standing. Each of L3 and Harris
shall cooperate fully with the alternative tax  advisor(s), including by
providing the necessary representation letters and other materials reasonably
requested by the alternative tax advisor(s). In the event that the alternative
tax advisor(s) is unwilling or unable to deliver the required  opinion with
the requisite level of certainty, and that Harris or L3, as applicable, has

Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that any 
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification. From and after the Effective Time, Harris
shall, and shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless to the fullest extent Harris would be permitted to do so under
applicable Law and Harris' Organizational Documents in effect as of the date

Harris or any of its Subsidiaries has an equity investment, in each case, when
acting in such capacity (the " _Harris Indemnified Parties_ "  and, together
with the L3 Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),  judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with, arising

undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final 
adjudication that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, L3 shall and, if L3 is  unable to, Harris
shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and
fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i)
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of L3's existing directors' 
and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) L3's existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from
one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as L3's
insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors'
and  officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of  liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as L3's
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions). If L3 and the  Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Harris shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for the Tail Period  the DandO

 

 

 

\- 56 -  


 

 

Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in L3's  existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Harris shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the Tail
Period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of  liability that are
substantially the same as provided in L3's existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement. Prior to or as of the Effective Time, Harris shall obtain and
fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of  (i)
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of Harris' existing directors'
and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) Harris' existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case for the Tail Period from one or
more insurance  carriers with the same or better credit rating as Harris'

Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
at least as favorable to the insureds  as Harris' existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions). If Harris
for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies  as of the
Effective Time, Harris shall continue to maintain in effect for the Tail
Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to  the insureds as provided in Harris' existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or Harris shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the Tail
Period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
substantially the  same as provided in Harris' existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification  under this
_Section 8.15_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify
Harris thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
Harris or  the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event of any Proceeding: (i) Harris or the
Surviving Corporation shall have the  right to assume the defense thereof (
_it_ _being_ _understood_ that by electing to assume the defense thereof,
neither Harris nor the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any
right to object to the Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification 
hereunder with respect thereto or assumed any liability with respect thereto),
except that if Harris or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or legal counsel or the Indemnified Party advises that there are
issues which raise  conflicts of interest between Harris or the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain legal
counsel satisfactory to them, and Harris or the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable and documented fees  and expenses of such legal counsel
for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Harris and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this _Section 8.15(c)_ to pay for only one firm of
legal  counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use
of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such legal
counsel with a conflict of interest ( _provided_   that the fewest number of
legal counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used); (ii)
the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if
Harris or the Surviving Corporation elects to assume such defense,  and
Harris and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any
such matter if Harris or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense; (iii) the Indemnified Parties shall not be liable for any settlement
effected  without their prior written consent if Harris or the Surviving
Corporation elects to assume such defense and Harris and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected

 

 

 

\- 57 -  


 

 

without their prior written consent if Harris or the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense; (iv) Harris and the Surviving Corporation
shall not have any obligation  hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when
a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such

11.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the

(together  with that certain Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of September 30, 2018, between L3 and Harris, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ")  constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, understandings and representations
and warranties, whether oral or  written, with respect to such matters,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect until the Closing.

 

 

11.9. _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. L3 and Harris hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties hereto, in
accordance with  and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than
Harris, L3 and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns any rights or remedies,  express or implied, hereunder,
including, without limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, except the rights of third-party
beneficiaries as are expressly provided in _Section 4.1_ [Combined Company
Governance and Additional Matters], and _Section __8.15_
[Indemnification;     Directors' and Officers' Insurance], which shall not
arise until after the Effective Time. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and  warranties are subject to waiver by
the Parties in accordance with _Section 11.2_ without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations  and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties.

 

 

 

\- 82 -  


 

 

Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or  circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

 

11.10. _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Harris to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Harris to cause such Subsidiary to take
such  action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of L3 to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of L3 to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of  the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action. Any obligation of one Party to another Party under this
Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an
Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have  been performed, satisfied
or fulfilled by such Party.

 

 

11.11. _Non-Recourse_. Unless expressly agreed to otherwise by the Parties in
writing, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Proceeding in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise resulting from this Agreement, 
any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions may only be brought against the Persons expressly named as
Parties and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to  such Party. No past, present or future director,
Employee (including any officer), incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, other equity holder or Persons in a similar capacity, controlling
person, Affiliate or other Representative of  any Party or of any Affiliate
of any Party, or any of their respective successors, Representatives and
permitted assigns, shall have any liability or other obligation for any
obligation of any Party under this Agreement or for any Proceeding in 
connection with, arising out of or otherwise resulting from this Agreement,
any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transactions.

 

 

11.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other
provisions  of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to  carry out, insofar as may be legal, valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances  shall not be
affected by such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in
any  other jurisdiction.

 

 

11.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for  convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. All article,
section, subsection, schedule, annex and exhibit references used in this 
Agreement are to articles, sections, subsections, schedules, annexes and
exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The exhibits, schedules
and annexes

 

 

 

\- 83 -  


 

 

attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are
incorporated herein for all purposes.

 

 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a  noun), it shall
have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral
genders  and vice versa. The words "includes" or "including" shall mean
"including without limitation," the words "hereof," "hereby," "herein,"
"hereunder" and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not any particular  section or article in which such words
appear and any reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall
only be a reference to such Law as of the date of this  Agreement. Currency
amounts referenced herein are in U.S. Dollars.

 

 

(c) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such  number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Whenever any action
must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such
action may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day.

 

 

(d) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly  defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP.

 

 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and  drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or  disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

 

 

11.14. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights
or  delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, directly or indirectly, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, except that Harris may cause
Merger Sub to assign any and  all of its rights under this Agreement, by
written notice to L3, to another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Harris with substantially identical ownership, capitalization and
Organizational Documents to be a Party in lieu of Merger  Sub, in which event
all references to Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made in
this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this  Agreement
shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such

as working capital over and above its capital stock paid in, to authorize and
cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon the real and personal property
of this corporation.

 

 

From time to time to determine whether and to what extent, and at what times
and places, and under what conditions and regulations, the  accounts and
books of this corporation (other than the stock ledger) or any of them, shall
be open to inspection of stockholders; and no stockholder shall have any right
of inspecting any account, book or document of this corporation except as 
conferred by statute, unless authorized by resolution of the stockholders or
directors.

 

 

Subject to Article FOURTEENTH of this Certificate of Incorporation, if the by-
laws so provide, to designate two or more of its number to  constitute an
executive committee, which committee shall for the time being, as provided in
said resolution or in the by-laws of this corporation, have and exercise any
or all of the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the 
business and affairs of this corporation, and have power to authorize the seal
of this corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

 

 

Pursuant to the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
stock issued and outstanding, having voting power, given at  a stockholders'
meeting duly called for that purpose, or when authorized by the written
consent of the holders of a majority of the voting stock issued and
outstanding, the Board of Directors shall have power and authority at any
meeting to sell,  lease or exchange all of the property and assets of this
corporation, including its good will and its corporate franchises, upon such
terms and conditions as its Board of Directors deems expedient and for the
best interest of the corporation.

 

   


 

 

Subject to Article FOURTEENTH of this Certificate of Incorporation, this
corporation may in its by-laws confer powers upon its directors  in addition
to the foregoing, and in addition to the powers and authorities expressly
conferred upon them by the statute.

 

 

Both stockholders and directors shall have power, if the by-laws so provide,

the provisions of the statutes), outside of the State of Delaware, at such
places as may be from time to time designated by the Board of Directors."

 

 

THIRD: Article EIGHTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the 
Corporation shall hereby be amended and restated to read in its entirety as
follows:

 

 

"EIGHTH: Subject to Article FOURTEENTH of this Certificate of Incorporation,
this corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change  or repeal any
provision contained in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation."

 

 

FOURTH: Article ELEVENTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the 
Corporation shall hereby be amended and restated to read in its entirety as
follows:

 

 

"ELEVENTH: Subject to Article FOURTEENTH of this Certificate of Incorporation,
the business and affairs of this corporation shall be  managed by or under
the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than 8 or more
than 13 directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to
time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the  entire
Board of Directors.

 

 

At each annual meeting of stockholders, all directors shall be elected for
terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and  until such
directors' successors shall have been elected and qualified. In no case will a
decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

 

 

Subject to Article FOURTEENTH of this Certificate of Incorporation, any
vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase  in the
number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then
in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be
filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a
quorum,  or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a
vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have
the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.

 

 

Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, of this corporation may be
removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority  of the shares
then entitled to vote at an election of directors at a meeting of stockholders
called for that purpose.

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes
or series of preferred or preference stock issued by this  corporation shall
have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office,
filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be 
governed by

 

 

 

2  


 

 

the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such
directors so elected shall not be divided into classes unless expressly
provided  by such terms.

 

 

No director of this corporation shall be personally liable to this corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of  fiduciary duty as a
director, provided that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the
liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty
to this corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in 
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of
law, (iii) under Section 174 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit."

,  _however_ , that if following such revocation (or any deemed revocation
pursuant to clause (ii) above), the unrevoked valid Special Meeting Requests
represent in the  aggregate less than the Requisite Percent, there shall be
no requirement to hold a special meeting. The first date on which unrevoked
valid Special Meeting Requests constituting not less than the Requisite
Percent shall have been delivered to  the Company is referred to herein as
the "Request Receipt Date".

 

 

(2) Special Meeting Request shall not be valid if:

 

 

(i) the Special Meeting Request  relates to an item of business that is not a
proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law;

 

 

(ii) the Request Receipt Date is  during the period commencing ninety days
prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual
meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting;

 

 

(iii) the purpose specified in the  Special Meeting Request is not the
nomination, election or removal of directors and an identical or substantially
similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a
"Similar Item") was presented at any meeting of shareholders  held within the
twelve months prior to the Request Receipt Date;

 

 

(iv) the purpose specified in the  Special Meeting Request is the nomination,
election or removal of directors and a Similar Item was presented at any
meeting of shareholders held within one hundred and twenty days prior to the
Request Receipt Date; or

 

 

(v) a Similar Item is included in  the Company's notice as an item of
business to be brought before a shareholder meeting that has been called but
not yet held or that is called for a date within ninety days of the Request
Receipt Date.

 

 

(3) A Shareholder Requested Special Meeting shall be  held at such date and
time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , 
that the Shareholder Requested Special Meeting shall be called for a date not
more than ninety days after the Request Receipt Date.

 

 

(4) Business transacted at any Shareholder Requested  Special Meeting shall
be limited to (i) the purpose(s) stated in the valid Special Meeting
Request(s) received from the Requisite Percent of record holders and (ii) any
additional matters that the Board of Directors determines to include in the 
Company's notice of the meeting. If none of the shareholders who submitted the
Special Meeting Request appears or sends a qualified representative to present
the matters to be presented for consideration that were specified in the
Shareholder  Meeting Request, the Company need not present such matters for a
vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter
may have been received by the Company.

 

 

(5) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall  be deemed to entitle
any shareholder to the reimbursement of expenses for soliciting proxies or any
other expenses

 

 

 

3  


 

 

incurred by such shareholder in connection with any shareholder meeting, which
expenses shall be borne by such shareholder and not by the Company.

 

 

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings_. A written or printed notice of every annual
or special meeting of the shareholders stating the time and place and the
purposes thereof shall be given to each shareholder entitled to  vote thereat
and to each shareholder entitled to notice as provided by law, which notice
shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to
the date of the meeting. Such notice shall be deemed given: (i) if mailed, 
when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to each
shareholder at such shareholder's address as it appears on the records of the
Company; (ii) if sent by electronic mail, when delivered to an electronic mail
address at  which the shareholder has consented to receive such notice; and
(iii) if posted on an electronic network together with a separate notice to
the shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving  of such separate notice of such posting. It shall
be the duty of the Secretary to give written notice of the annual meeting, and
of each special meeting when requested so to do by the Board of Directors or
as provided in Section 3(b) of this  Article II. Any shareholder may waive in
writing any notice required to be given by law or under these By-Laws and by
attendance or voting at any meeting without protesting the lack of proper
notice shall be deemed to have waived notice  thereof. Notice shall be deemed
to have been given to all shareholders of record who share an address if
notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule
14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  "Exchange Act") and
Section 233 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

 

Section 5. _Shareholder List_. A complete list of the shareholders entitled to
vote at each meeting of shareholders, arranged in alphabetical order, with the
address of each and the number of voting shares held by  each, shall be
prepared by or at the instance of the Secretary and made available at the
location where the meeting is to be held, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting, and shall at all times during the usual hours for business in said 
ten (10) day period and during the time of said meeting be open to examination
by any shareholder.

 

 

Section 6. _Voting and Proxies_. At all meetings of shareholders, only such
shareholders shall be entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, who appear upon
the records of the Company as the holders of shares at the  time possessing
voting power, or if a record date be fixed as hereinafter provided, those
appearing as such on such record date. Each shareholder entitled to vote at a
meeting of shareholders may authorize another person or persons to act for 
such shareholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
shareholder as  proxy by executing a writing authorizing such person or
persons to act for such shareholder as proxy or by transmitting or authorizing
the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic
transmission to the person who will  be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy
solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly
authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such
transmission, provided that any such telegram,  cablegram, or other means of
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other means of
electronic transmission was authorized by the  shareholder.

 

 

Section 7. _Quorum and  Adjournments_. Except as may otherwise be required by
law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, the
holders of a majority of

 

 

 

4  


 

 

the shares entitled to vote at a shareholders' meeting shall constitute a
quorum to hold  such meeting; provided, however, that any meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present or otherwise, may, by vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting shares represented thereat, adjourn from time to time
and from place to place in the  county wherein said meeting was originally
called without notice other than by announcement at such meeting.

 

 

Section 8. _Advance Notice of  Shareholder Nominees for Director and Other
Shareholder Proposals_. (a) The matters to be considered and brought before
any annual or special meeting of  shareholders of the Company shall be
limited to only such matters, including the nomination and election of
directors, as shall be brought properly before such meeting in compliance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 8 or in Section  3(b) of this
Article II or Section 11 of this Article II.

 

 

(b) For any matter to be brought properly before any  annual meeting of
shareholders, the matter must be (i) specified in the notice of the annual
meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise
brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of 
Directors, (iii) brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder who is a
shareholder of record of the Company on the date the notice provided for in
this Section 8(b) is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is
entitled to vote at  the annual meeting of shareholders on such matter and
who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 8(b) or (iv)
brought pursuant to Section 11 of this Article II. In addition to any other
requirements under applicable law and the  Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and these By-Laws, written notice (the "Shareholder Notice") of
any nomination or other proposal by a shareholder must be timely and any
proposal, other than a nomination, must constitute a proper matter for 
shareholder action. To be timely, the Shareholder Notice must be delivered to
the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company
not less than ninety (90) nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days
prior to the  first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding
year; provided, however, that if (and only if) the annual meeting is not
scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty (30) days before
such anniversary date and ends  thirty (30) days after such anniversary date
(an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an
"Other Meeting Date"), the Shareholder Notice shall be given in the manner
provided herein by the later of the close of  business on (i) the date ninety
(90) days prior to such Other Meeting Date or (ii) the tenth day following the
date such Other Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed.

 

 

A Shareholder Notice must contain the following information: (i) whether the
shareholder is providing the notice at the request of a  beneficial holder of
shares, whether the shareholder, any such beneficial holder or any nominee has
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, or has received any
financial assistance, funding or other consideration from any other person 
with respect to the investment by the shareholder or such beneficial holder in
the Company or the matter the Shareholder Notice relates to, and the details
thereof, including the name of such other person (the shareholder, any
beneficial holder  on whose behalf the notice is being delivered, any
nominees listed in the notice and any persons with whom such agreement,
arrangement or understanding exists or from whom such assistance has been
obtained are hereinafter collectively referred to  as "Interested Persons"),
(ii) the name and address of all Interested Persons, (iii) a complete
description of all equity securities and debt instruments, whether held in the
form of loans or capital market instruments, of the Company or any of  its
subsidiaries beneficially owned by all Interested Persons, (iv) whether and
the extent to which any hedging, derivative or other transaction (a

 

 

 

5  


 

 

"Derivative Transaction") is in place or has been entered into within the six
months preceding the date of delivery of the Shareholder Notice by or for 
the benefit of any Interested Person with respect to the Company or its
subsidiaries, or any of their respective securities, debt instruments or
credit ratings, the effect or intent of which transaction is to give rise to
gain or loss as a result  of changes in the trading price of such securities
or debt instruments or changes in the credit ratings for the Company, its
subsidiaries or any of their respective securities or debt instruments (or,
more generally, changes in the perceived  creditworthiness of the Company or
its subsidiaries), or to increase or decrease the voting power of such
Interested Person, and if so, a summary of the material terms thereof, and (v)
a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record  of stock of the
Company that would be entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in
person or by proxy at the meeting to propose the matter set forth in the
Shareholder Notice. As used herein, "beneficially owned" with respect to 
securities shall mean all securities which such person is deemed to
beneficially own pursuant to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act. The
Shareholder Notice shall be updated not later than 10 days after the record
date for the  determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting
to provide any material changes in the foregoing information as of the record
date. Any Shareholder Notice relating to the nomination of directors must also
contain (i) the information  regarding each nominee required by paragraphs
(a), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (or the corresponding provisions of any successor
regulation), (ii) each nominee's signed consent to  serve as a director of
the Company if elected, and (iii) information as to whether each nominee is
eligible for consideration as an independent director under the relevant
standards contemplated by Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K (or the 
corresponding provisions of any successor regulation). The Company may also
require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information, including
completion of the Company's directors questionnaire, as it may reasonably
require to determine  whether the nominee would be considered "independent"
as a director or as a member of the audit committee of the Board of Directors
under the various rules and standards applicable to the Company. Any
Shareholder Notice with respect to a matter  other than the nomination of
directors must contain (i) the text of the proposal to be presented, including
the text of any resolutions to be proposed for consideration by shareholders
and (ii) a brief written statement of the reasons such  shareholder favors
the proposal.

 

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(b) to the contrary, in the event
that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of  Directors of the
Company at the next annual meeting is increased and either all of the nominees
for director at the next annual meeting or the size of the increased Board of
Directors is not publicly announced or disclosed by the Company at least  one
hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting, a Shareholder Notice shall also be considered timely
hereunder, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by
such increase, if it  shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at
the principal executive office of the Company not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the first date all of such nominees or the
size of the increased Board of  Directors shall have been publicly announced
or disclosed.

 

 

(c) For any matter to be brought properly before any  special meeting of
shareholders, the matter must be set forth in the Company's notice of the
meeting. In the event that the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders
for the purpose of electing one or more persons to the Board of Directors, 
any shareholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for
election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of the
meeting, if

 

 

 

6  

the Shareholder Notice required by Section 8(b) hereof shall be delivered to
the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the 
Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the
day on which the date of the special meeting and either the names of the
nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting or
the number of  directors to be elected is publicly announced or disclosed.

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 8, a matter shall be  deemed to have been
"publicly announced or disclosed" if such matter is disclosed in a press
release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a
comparable national news or wire service or in a document publicly filed by
the  Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

 

(e) In no event shall the adjournment of an annual  meeting or special
meeting or the postponement of any meeting that does not require a change in
the record date for such meeting, or any announcement thereof, commence a new
period for the giving of notice as provided in this Section 8. This  Section
8 shall not (i) affect the rights of shareholders to request inclusion of
proposals made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) apply to
the election of directors selected by or pursuant to the provisions of Article
FOURTH,  Section 3 of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to
the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company
having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation
to elect directors under  specified circumstances.

 

 

(f) The person presiding at any meeting of  shareholders, in addition to
making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the
meeting, shall have the power and duty to determine whether notice of nominees
and other matters proposed to be brought before a meeting  has been duly
given in the manner provided in this Section 8 and, if not so given, shall
direct and declare at the meeting that such nominees and other matters are out
of order and shall not be considered. Notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 8, if the shareholder or a qualified representative
of the shareholder does not appear at the annual or special meeting of
shareholders of the Company to present any such nomination, or make any such
proposal, such  nomination or proposal shall be disregarded, notwithstanding
that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company.

 

 

Section 9. _Conduct of Meetings_. The Board of Directors of the Company may
adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of
meetings of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except  to the extent
inconsistent with applicable law and such rules and regulations adopted by the
Board of Directors, the chairman of each meeting of shareholders shall have
the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures 
and to do all such acts, including causing an adjournment of such meeting, as,
in the judgment of such Chairman, are appropriate. Such rules, regulations or
procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
chairman of  the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a)
the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting, including
fixing the time for opening and closing the polls for voting on each matter;
(b) rules and  procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety
of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the
meeting to shareholders of record of the Company, their duly authorized and
constituted proxies or such  other persons as the chairman shall permit; (d)
restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement
thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants. Unless, and to the  extent determined by the

 

 

 

7  


 

 

Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of shareholders
shall not be  required to be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary
procedure.

 

 

Section 10. _Organization of  Meeting_ s. Meetings of shareholders shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in his or her
absence by the Chief Executive Officer,  or in the absence of the foregoing
persons by a Chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or, in the absence
of any such designation, by a Chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary,
or in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant  Secretary, shall act as the
secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary or Assistant
Secretary, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting.

 

 

Section 11. _Shareholder  Nominations Included in the Company 's Proxy
Materials_. (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 11, if expressly
requested in the relevant Nomination  Notice (as defined below), the Company
shall include in its proxy statement for any annual meeting of shareholders:

 

 

(i) the names of any person or  persons nominated for election to the Board
of Directors (each, a "Nominee"), which shall also be included on the
Company's form of proxy and ballot, by any Eligible Holder (as defined below)
or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders that has  (individually and
collectively, in the case of a group) satisfied, as determined by the Board of
Directors, all applicable conditions and complied with all applicable
procedures set forth in this Section 11 (such Eligible Holder or group of 
Eligible Holders being a "Nominating Shareholder");

 

 

(ii) disclosure about each Nominee  and the Nominating Shareholder required
under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
(the "Proxy Rules") or other applicable law to be included in the proxy
statement;

 

 

(iii) any statement included by the  Nominating Shareholder in the Nomination
Notice and expressly designated therein for inclusion in the proxy statement
in support of each Nominee's election to the Board of Directors (subject,
without limitation, to Section 11(e)(ii) hereof), if  such statement does not
exceed 500 words and fully complies with the Proxy Rules, including Rule 14a-9
(the "Supporting Statement"); and

 

 

(iv) any other information that the  Company or the Board of Directors
determines, in their discretion, to include in the proxy statement relating to
the nomination of each Nominee, including, without limitation, any statement
in opposition to the nomination, any of the information  provided pursuant to
this Section 11 and any solicitation materials or related information with
respect to a Nominee.

 

 

For purposes of this Section 11, any determination to be made by the Board of
Directors may be made by the Board of Directors, a  committee of the Board of
Directors or any officer of the Company designated by the Board of Directors
or a committee of the Board of Directors, and any such determination shall be
final and binding on the Company, any Eligible Holder, any  Nominating
Shareholder, any Nominee and any other person so long as made in good faith
(without any further requirements). The chairman of any annual meeting of
shareholders, in

 

 

 

8  


 

 

addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the
conduct of the meeting, shall have the power and duty to determine whether a 
Nominee has been nominated in accordance with the requirements of this Section
11 and, if not so nominated, shall direct and declare at the meeting that such
Nominee shall not be considered.

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

_Maximum Number of Nominees_.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

(i) The Company shall not be  required to include in its proxy statement for
an annual meeting of shareholders more Nominees than that number of
individuals as is equal to the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of the total
number of directors of the Company on the last day on  which a Nomination
Notice may be submitted pursuant to this Section 11 (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) (such greater number, the "Maximum Number"). The Maximum
Number for a particular annual meeting shall be reduced by the number of:  
(1) Nominees whom the Board of Directors itself nominates for election at such
annual meeting; (2) Nominees who cease to satisfy, or Nominees of Nominating
Shareholders that cease to satisfy, the eligibility requirements in this
Section 11, as  determined by the Board of Directors; (3) Nominees whose
nomination is withdrawn by the Nominating Shareholder or who become unwilling
to serve on the Board of Directors; and (4) the number of incumbent directors
who had been Nominees with  respect to any of the preceding two annual
meetings of shareholders and whose reelection at the upcoming annual meeting
is being recommended by the Board of Directors. If one or more vacancies for
any reason occurs on the Board of Directors  after the deadline for
submitting a Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 11(d) hereof but before
the date of the annual meeting, and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce
the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, then  the Maximum
Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so
reduced.

 

 

(ii) If the number of Nominees  pursuant to this Section 11 for any annual
meeting of shareholders exceeds the Maximum Number then, promptly upon notice
from the Company, each Nominating Shareholder in turn will select one Nominee
for inclusion in the proxy statement until the  Maximum Number is reached,
going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the ownership position
as disclosed in each Nominating Shareholder's Nomination Notice, with the
process repeated if the Maximum Number is not reached after each  Nominating
Shareholder has selected one Nominee. If, after the deadline for submitting a
Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 11(d) hereof, a Nominee or
Nominating Shareholder ceases to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this
Section  11, as determined by the Board of Directors, a Nominating
Shareholder withdraws its nomination of a Nominee or a Nominee becomes
unwilling to serve on the Board of Directors, whether before or after the
mailing or other distribution of the  definitive proxy statement, then the
nomination of the applicable Nominee(s) shall be disregarded, and the Company:
(1) shall not be required to include in its proxy statement or on any ballot
or form of proxy the disregarded Nominee(s) or any  successor or replacement
nominee(s) proposed by the Nominating Shareholder or by any other Nominating
Shareholder and (2) may otherwise communicate to its shareholders, including
without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement  or
ballot or form of proxy, that the disregarded Nominee(s) will not be included
as a nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will
not be voted on at the annual meeting.

    | (c)  |  

_Eligibility of Nominating Shareholder_.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

(i) An "Eligible Holder" is a person  who has either (1) been a record holder
of the shares of common stock used to satisfy the eligibility requirements in
this Section 11(c) continuously for the three-year period specified in Section
11(c)(ii) hereof or (2) provides to the Secretary  of the Company, within the
time period referred to in Section 11(d) hereof, evidence of continuous
ownership of such shares for such three-year period from one or more
securities intermediaries in a form that the Board of Directors determines 
would be deemed acceptable for purposes of a shareholder proposal under Rule
14a-8(b)(2) under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule).

 

 

(ii) An Eligible Holder or group of  up to 20 Eligible Holders may submit a
nomination in accordance with this Section 11 only if the person or group (in
the aggregate) has owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) of
shares of the Company's common stock continuously  throughout the three-year
period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination
Notice, and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of
the annual meeting. Two or more funds that are (x) under common  management
and investment control, (y) under common management and funded primarily by a
single employer or (z) a "group of investment companies," as such term is
defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, shall be treated as one Eligible Holder if such Eligible Holder shall
provide together with the Nomination Notice documentation reasonably
satisfactory to the Board of Directors that demonstrates that the funds meet
the criteria set  forth in (x), (y) or (z) hereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event of a nomination by a group of Eligible Holders, any and
all requirements and obligations for an individual Eligible Holder that are
set forth in this Section 11, including  the minimum holding period, shall
apply to each member of such group; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that the
Minimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the group in the aggregate.
Should any shareholder cease to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this
Section 11, as determined by the Board of Directors, or withdraw from a group
of  Eligible Holders at any time prior to the annual meeting of shareholders,
the group of Eligible Holders shall be deemed only to own the shares held by
the remaining members of the group.

 

 

(iii) The "Minimum Number" of shares  of the Company's common stock means 3%
of the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of the most recent date
for which such amount is given in any filing by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the submission  of the Nomination
Notice.

 

 

(iv) For purposes of this Section  11, an Eligible Holder "owns" only those
outstanding shares of the Company as to which the Eligible Holder possesses
both:

 

 

(A) the full voting and investment  rights pertaining to the shares; and

 

 

(B) the full economic interest in  (including the opportunity for profit and
risk of loss on) such shares; _provided_ that the number of shares calculated
in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) of this  Section 11(c)(iv) shall not
include

 

 

 

10  


 

 

any shares: (1) purchased or sold by such Eligible Holder or any of its
affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or  closed, (2) sold
short by such Eligible Holder, (3) borrowed by such Eligible Holder or any of
its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of
its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or subject to any other 
obligation to resell to another person, or (4) subject to any option, warrant,
forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar
agreement entered into by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates,
whether any such  instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or
with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of the
Company, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to
have, the purpose or effect of:   (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent
or at any time in the future, such Eligible Holder's or any of its affiliates'
full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (y)
hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree, gain  or loss arising from
the full economic interest of such shares by such Eligible Holder or any of
its affiliates.

 

 

An Eligible Holder "owns" shares held in the name of a nominee or other
intermediary so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to instruct how
the  shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses
the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Holder's ownership of
shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible
Holder has delegated  any voting power by means of a proxy, power of
attorney, or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any
time by the Eligible Holder. An Eligible Holder's ownership of shares shall be
deemed to continue during any period in  which the Eligible Holder has loaned
such shares provided that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall such
loaned shares on five business days' notice and continues to hold such shares
through the date of the annual meeting. The terms  "owned," "owning" and
other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether
outstanding shares of the Company are "owned" for these purposes shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

 

 

(v) No Eligible Holder shall be  permitted to be in more than one group
constituting a Nominating Shareholder, and if any Eligible Holder appears as a
member of more than one group, it shall be deemed to be a member of the group
that has the largest ownership position as  reflected in the Nomination
Notice.

 

 

(d) _Nomination Notice_. To nominate a Nominee, the Nominating Shareholder
must, no earlier than 150 calendar days and no later than 120 calendar days
before the anniversary of the date that the Company mailed its proxy 
statement for the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders, submit to the
Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company all
of the following information and documents (collectively, the "Nomination
Notice");  provided, however, that if (and only if) the annual meeting is not
scheduled to be held within a period that commences 30 days before such
anniversary date and ends 30 days after the anniversary of the prior year's
meeting date (an annual meeting  date outside such period being referred to
herein as an "Other Meeting Date"), the Nomination Notice shall be given in
the manner provided herein by the later of the close of business on the date
that is 180 days prior to such Other Meeting Date  or the tenth day following
the date such Other Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed:

 

 

 

11  


 

 

(i) A Schedule 14N (or any successor  form) relating to each Nominee,
completed and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the
Nominating Shareholder as applicable, in accordance with rules promulgated
under the Exchange Act;

 

 

(ii) A written notice, in a form  deemed satisfactory by the Board of
Directors, of the nomination of each Nominee that includes the following
additional information, agreements, representations and warranties by the

such  person served at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
trustee, member, shareholder, partner, incorporator or liquidator of or in any
other capacity for any other enterprise, shall survive the termination of such
request as to  service prior to termination of such request. No amendment of
this by-law shall impair the rights of any person arising at any time with

partnership, limited liability company or other entity  in which the Company

interest; the term "other enterprise" shall include any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association or

by-laws of such Subsidiary or other enterprise  or chosen in such manner as
is prescribed by the by-laws of such Subsidiary or other enterprise or
determined by the Board of Directors of such Subsidiary or other enterprise,

Company" shall include service as a director or officer of the Company which
imposes duties on, or  involves services by, such director or officer with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan,
its participants or beneficiaries shall be  deemed to be indemnifiable
expenses; and action by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan

participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action not 
opposed to the best interests of the Company.

Company may provide to (i) any one or more employees and  other agents of the
Company, (ii) any one or more officers, employees and other agents of any

agents of any other enterprise, rights of indemnification and to receive 
payment or reimbursement of expenses, including attorneys' fees, that are
similar to the rights conferred in this Article VI on directors and officers
of the Company or any Subsidiary or other enterprise. Any such rights shall
have the same force  and effect as they would have if they were conferred in
this Article VI.

 

 

Nothing in this Article VI shall limit the power of the Company or the Board
of Directors to provide rights of indemnification and to  make payment and
reimbursement of expenses, including attorneys' fees, to directors, officers,

determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any
such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of
any such dividend, or to any such allotment of  rights, or to exercise the
rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of shares, and in
such case such shareholders, and only such shareholders as shall be
shareholders of record on the date so fixed, shall be entitled to such

thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend or to receive such allotment

transfer of any shares on the books of the Company after any such record date
fixed as aforesaid.

 

 

ARTICLE IX. 
  Stock.

 

 

Section 1. _Certificates ;  Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of stock of
the Company shall be represented by certificates in such form as the
appropriate officers of the Company may  from time to time prescribe;
provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions
that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock of the Company shall
be uncertificated shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing  or the adoption of
such a resolution or resolutions by the Board of Directors, each holder of
uncertificated shares shall be entitled, upon request, to a certificate
representing such shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to any share 
represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is
surrendered to the Company. Share certificates shall be numbered and
registered in a share register as they are issued. Share certificates shall
exhibit the name of the  registered holder and the number and class of shares
and the series, if any, represented thereby and the par value of each such
share or a statement that each such share is without par value, as the case
may be. Except as otherwise provided by  law, the rights and obligations of
the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the
holders of shares represented by certificates of the same class and series
shall be identical.

 

 

Section 2. _Signatures on  Certificates_. Every share certificate shall be
signed, in the name of the Company, by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President or  a Vice President and countersigned, in
the name of the Company, by the Corporate Secretary, an Assistant Secretary,
the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer and shall be sealed with the Company's
corporate seal. Such signatures and seal may be  facsimile, engraved or
printed. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or
transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may require any or all
certificates representing shares of stock to bear the signature or 
signatures of any of them. Where a certificate is signed (a) by a transfer
agent or an assistant or co-transfer agent, (b) by a transfer clerk or (c) by
a registrar or co-registrar, the signature thereon of any authorized signatory
may be  facsimile. Where a certificate is signed by a registrar or co-
registrar, the signature of any transfer agent or assistant or co-transfer
agent thereon may be by facsimile signature of the authorized signatory of
such transfer agent or  assistant or co-transfer agent. In case any officer
or officers of the Company who have signed, or whose facsimile, engraved or
printed signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such  officer or officers, whether because of
death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates have
been delivered by the Company, such certificate or certificates may,
nevertheless, be issued and delivered as though the  person or persons who
signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile, engraved or
printed signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be
such officer or officers of the Company.

 

 

Section 3. _Lost, Stolen or  Destroyed Certificates ; Issuance of New
Certificates_. In case of loss, theft or destruction of any certificate
representing shares of stock or other  securities of the Company, another may
be issued, or uncertificated shares may be issued, in its place upon
satisfactory proof of such loss, theft or destruction and upon the giving of a
satisfactory bond of

 

 

 

23  


 

 

indemnity to the Company and to the transfer agents, transfer clerks and
registrars, if  any, of such stock or other securities, as the case may be.

 

 

Section 4. _Transfer of Shares_. Subject to valid transfer restrictions and
stop-transfer orders, upon surrender to the Company, or a transfer agent,
transfer clerk or registrar of the Company, of a certificate  representing
shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer, the Company may issue a new certificate
or new equivalent uncertificated shares, as the case may be, or in the case
of  uncertificated shares, upon request, a certificate representing, or other
evidence of, such new equivalent uncertificated shares, to the person entitled
thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
Upon receipt  of proper transfer instructions from the holder of
uncertificated shares, the Company shall cancel such uncertificated shares and
issue new equivalent uncertificated shares, or, upon such holder's request, a
certificate representing, or other  evidence of, such new equivalent
uncertificated shares, to the person entitled thereto, and record the
transaction upon its books. In no event shall a transfer of shares affect the
right of the Company to pay any dividend upon the stock to the  holder of
record thereof for all purposes, and no transfer shall be valid, except
between the parties thereto, until such transfer shall have been made upon the
books of the Company.

 

 

Section 5. _Registered  Shareholders_. The Company and its transfer agents,
transfer clerks and registrars, if any, shall be entitled to treat the holder
of record of any share or  shares as the holder in fact thereof and shall not
be bound to recognize any equitable or other claims to, or interest in, such
shares on the part of any other person and shall not be liable for any
registration or transfer of shares which are  registered, or to be
registered, in the name of a fiduciary or the nominee of a fiduciary unless
made with actual knowledge that a fiduciary, or nominee of a fiduciary, is
committing a breach of trust in requesting such registration or  transfer, or
with knowledge of such facts that its participation therein amounts to bad
faith.

 

 

ARTICLE X. 
  Fiscal Year.

 

 

From and after January 1, 2020, the fiscal year of the Company shall  end on
December 31 unless and until the Board of Directors shall otherwise determine.
Prior to such date, the fiscal year of the Company shall end on the Friday
nearest June 30 unless and until the Board of Directors shall otherwise 
determine.

 

 

ARTICLE XI. 
  Amendments.

 

 

Subject to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws may be
made or altered in any respect in whole or in part by the  affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon at any
annual or special meeting of the shareholders, if notice of the proposed
alteration or change to be made is properly brought before the meeting under 
these By-Laws. Subject to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these By-
Laws may also be made or altered in any respect in whole or in part, by the
affirmative vote of the majority of the directors then comprising the Board of
Directors.

ARTICLE XII. 
  Exclusive Forum for Certain Actions.

 

 

Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative  action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim
of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee
of the Company to the Company or the Company's shareholders, (iii) any
action  asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or
other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the
Delaware General Corporation Law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or these By-Laws (in each  case, as they may be amended from time to time),
or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or
officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs
doctrine shall be a state court located within  the State of Delaware (or, if
no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the
federal district court for the District of Delaware).

_Exhibit C_

 

Requisite Regulatory Approvals

 


 

 

 

       1.  |  

The Parties agree that the Requisite Regulatory Approvals comprise all
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, filings and declarations and the
lapse of all such  waiting periods, as applicable, required or advisable
under any Antitrust Law of the United States, the European Union, Australia,
Canada, and Turkey; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in the event that the
European Commission confirms that it does not assert jurisdiction over the
Merger (such confirmation, a " _No EC Jurisdiction Event_ "), Germany and,
subject to paragraph 3 of this _Exhibit     C_ , the United Kingdom, shall
be substituted for the European Union in the list of Requisite Regulatory
Approvals.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       2.  |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the European Commission
asserts jurisdiction over the Merger and, prior to Closing, Article 21 of
Council Regulation (EC)  No. 139/2004 ceases to prevent the competent
authorities in the United Kingdom from applying the Antitrust Law of the
United Kingdom to the Merger (such cessation, a " _UK Withdrawal Event_ "),
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall comprise (i) subject to paragraph 3
of this _Exhibit C_ , the  approval of the Merger under any Antitrust Law by
the competent authorities in the United Kingdom, (ii) the authorizations,
consents, orders, approvals, filings and declarations and the lapse of all
such waiting periods, as applicable,  required or advisable under any
Antitrust Law of the United States, Australia, Canada and Turkey and (iii) as
required, the approval of the Merger under any Antitrust Law in the European
Union or Germany.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       3.  |  

In the event that a No EC Jurisdiction Event or a UK Withdrawal Event occurs,
the Parties and their respective Antitrust Law counsel shall cooperate to
determine as  promptly as practicable (and in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the occurrence of such event) whether it would be
advisable to request the approval of the Merger under the Antitrust Law of the
United Kingdom, and such  co-operation shall include seeking guidance from
the competent authorities in the United Kingdom if the Parties mutually agree
it is advisable to seek such guidance. If at the conclusion of that period,
either Party, acting reasonably,  determines that it would be advisable to
request the approval of the Merger under the Antitrust Law of the United
Kingdom, such approval shall be included in the definition of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals under paragraph 1 or  paragraph 2 (as applicable) of
this _Exhibit C_.
