Purchaser of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail
the particulars of such disagreement, within forty-five (45) days after
its receipt of the Closing Statement. In the event that Seller does not
provide such a notice of disagreement within such forty-five (45) day period,
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement and the
calculation and determination of the Closing Adjustment Items delivered by
Purchaser, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided,
Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation and determination of
the Closing Adjustment Items included within Sellers notice of disagreement.
If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements,
then Deloitte USA LLP (or such other independent accounting or financial
consulting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected
by Purchaser and Seller) (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") shall resolve any
remaining disagreements with respect to the Closing Adjustment Items included
within Sellers notice of disagreement. Purchaser and Seller agree to jointly
enter into a customary indemnity agreement with the Independent Accountant in
connection with the retention of such Independent Accountant. Each of
Purchaser and Seller shall promptly provide their assertions regarding
any disputes relating to the Closing Adjustment Items included within
Sellers notice of disagreement and, to the extent relevant thereto, the
Closing Statement in writing to the Independent Accountant and to each other.
The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to render its determination
with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably practicable (which
the parties hereto agree should not be later than thirty (30) days following
the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Independent Accountant).
The Independent Accountant shall (i) base its determination solely on the
written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an independent
investigation and (ii) consider only those items or amounts relating to the
Closing Adjustment Items as to which Seller disagreed within its notice of
disagreement, in accordance with this _Section 2.6(b),_ and (iii) use the
definitions of the defined terms used in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ provided
in this Agreement. With respect to each disputed item, the Independent
Accountants determination, if not in accordance with the position of either
Purchaser or Seller, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the
lower, of the amounts presented in Purchasers calculation of the Closing
Adjustment Items pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or in Sellers written
disagreement of any such calculation pursuant to this  _Section 2.6(b)_. The
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties and no party shall seek further recourse to any
Governmental Authority other than to enforce the determination of
the Independent Accountant. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. The date on
which Closing Date Net Working Capital is finally determined in accordance
with

 



25  this _Section 2.6(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination
Date_." The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, on an inversely
proportional basis, based upon the relative difference between the amounts in
dispute that have been submitted to the Independent Accountant and the
Independent Accountants calculation thereof. Solely by way of example, if
Purchaser claims in the Closing Statement that the Adjustment Amount is
$1,000,000, Seller claims in the notice of disagreement that the Adjustment

Adjustment Amount shall be paid as follows.

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following

actual amounts paid by the Company in settlement of the Closing Date Unvested
SARs (excluding the employer portion of all payroll and employment Taxes
(including social security, Medicare and unemployment) related thereto) after
taking into consideration the Forfeited Unvested SARs Amount, is greater than
$10,000,000 or (y) the Company pays any amounts owing in respect of any New
Unvested SARs (including the employer portion of all payroll and employment
Taxes (including social security, Medicare and unemployment) related
thereto), Seller shall promptly deliver the amount of such excess (in case of
(x)) and the amounts owing in respect of any New Unvested SARs (in respect of
(y)), together with the applicable portion of the employer portion of all
payroll and employment Taxes (including social security, Medicare and
unemployment) related thereto, to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately

withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any

will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made.

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any
liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing that is
not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, (B) nothing in this
_Section 6.3(c)_ shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (I)
cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article IX_ to not be satisfied
or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (II) require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected
to conflict with or violate the Companys organizational documents or any Law,

or expense (including attorneys fees) in connection with the Debt Financing
and any information provided in connection therewith or providing the
assistance contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, in each case other than
to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct of such Financing Indemnitee, as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Debt Financing
Cooperation Indemnity shall survive the Closing or any termination of this
Agreement. Except for the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Article III of this Agreement, the Company shall not have any
liability to Purchaser in respect of any financial information or data or
other information provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. All non-
public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries obtained by Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective

by the Company (it being understood and agreed that information shall be
permitted to be shared with Purchasers financing sources so long as they
agree to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, including though "click-
through" acknowledgements). Purchaser shall promptly reimburse the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this _Section
6.3(c)_ and, to the extent Purchaser does not reimburse the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary for any such cost on or prior to the date of the Closing
Balance Sheet (so long as reasonable documentation was provided supporting

58  current asset in the amount of such unreimbursed costs (and no such amounts
shall be included as current liabilities in the Closing Balance Sheet
calculation or included in the calculation of Company Expenses) so long as
such expenses are invoiced at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall not be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing for which
it is not reimbursed by Purchaser and, to the extent Purchaser does not
reimburse the Company or its applicable Subsidiary for any such fee on or
prior to the date of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Company shall be deemed to
have a current asset in the amount of such unreimbursed fee (and no such
amounts shall be included as current liabilities in the Closing Balance Sheet
calculation or included in the calculation of Company Expenses).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set
forth in _Section 9.2(b)_ , as it applies to the Companys obligations under

ARTICLE VII.

COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

7.1 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



59 (a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, member, manager,
unitholder and officer of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, to
the fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective
certificate of formation, operating agreement or other organizational
documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Purchaser
shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (A) to maintain for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date provisions in its
certificate of formation, operating agreement and other organizational
documents concerning the elimination of liability of directors and the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Companys and its Subsidiaries former and current
officers, directors, members, managers, employees, and agents that are no
less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of certificate of
formation, operating agreement and other organizational documents of the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of
this Agreement and (B) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law and (ii) Purchaser
agrees that any indemnification and advancement of expenses available to any
current or former director of the Company or its Subsidiaries by virtue of
such current or former directors service as a partner or employee of any
investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing (any
such current or former director, a " _Sponsor Director_ ") shall be secondary
to the indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided by
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
7.1_ and that Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) shall be the
primary indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, (B) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of
all expenses and the payment of all Damages with respect to Sponsor Directors
which are addressed by this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and (C) shall not make any
claim for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect of any other indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with
respect to any matter addressed by this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_. Purchaser shall
assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section_ __ _
7.1_.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause coverage to be extended
under the Companys then-current directors and officers liability insurance
by obtaining a non-cancellable "tail" policy for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"), and Purchaser shall cause
the Company to maintain in effect such DandO Tail Policy; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, any
insurance required to be maintained under this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall be
continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof. Seller
and Purchaser shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
the DandO Tail Policy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall survive the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby indefinitely

 



60  and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns
of Purchaser and the Company. In the event that Purchaser or the Company or
any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_.

 

7.2 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date to, use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
necessary so that on and after the Closing and at all times prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, officers and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (" _Covered Employees_ ") are provided base salary or wages
and annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding any stock appreciation rights
awards) with at least reasonably equivalent value in the aggregate (with
neither base salary nor wages and annual cash bonus opportunity individually
being materially and adversely different) to those made available by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such officers and employees immediately prior
to the Closing. For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in all
employee benefits provided by Purchaser (other than for purposes of benefit
accrual in any defined-benefit pension plan or scheme), Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts so that the Covered Employees will be
credited with their years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
prior employers (to the extent service with prior employers is taken into
account under the plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries), except where
such crediting would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the eligibility of Covered Employees to participate in any welfare benefit
plan or program of Purchaser, or any Subsidiary of Purchaser, shall not be
subject to any exclusions or limitations for any pre-existing conditions
except to the extent such individual was or would have been subject to such
exclusion under similar benefit plans and programs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that each such welfare benefit plan shall waive eligibility waiting
periods and Covered Employees shall be given credit under the applicable plan
for amounts paid during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums, as
though such amounts have been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable plan. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (a) is
intended to be or shall be considered to be an establishment, amendment or
modification of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of the
Company, Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries, (b) shall require Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular
Covered Employee following the Closing Date, or (c) shall restrict Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of
any Covered Employee at any time and for any reason. To the extent Purchaser
offers employment commencing on the Closing Date to any Covered Employee, the
Company shall confirm with such Covered Employee whether he/she accepts such
employment by Purchaser, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such Covered Employee to accept such offer of employment by Purchaser.

 



61 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 7.2(a)_ , Purchaser shall,
or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date to,
deliver to each holder of Unvested SARs through payroll to each such holder
(subject to withholding for Taxes, which amounts shall be disbursed by the
Company to the applicable Taxing Authority, and any terms and conditions in
the SARs Plan, including with respect to vesting of such Unvested SARs) the
amounts set forth next to such holders name in the SARs Settlement Statement,
such amounts to be paid (or caused to be paid) on or promptly after the
corresponding dates set forth in the SARs Settlement Statement.

(c) The Company shall take all necessary actions to terminate the Conexant
Systems, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, effective as of immediately
prior to, and contingent on, the Closing, and all documentation reflecting
such actions shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of
Purchaser. Such actions shall include, without limitation, the adoption of
resolutions by Seller, in its capacity as the sole member and managing member
of the Company, (i) terminating the Company 401(k) Plan contingent on the
Closing, (ii) causing all participants to be fully vested in their accounts
(including with respect to employer matching contributions), and (iii)
permitting each Covered Employee having an outstanding loan under such Covered
Employees account under the Company 401(k) Plan to rollover such outstanding
loan and such Covered Employees account balance to Purchasers 401(k)
defined contribution plan. As of the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Covered Employees to be eligible to participate in its 401(k) Plan. As soon as
practicable following the Closing, subject to such reasonable procedural and
other requirements and restrictions as Purchaser deems necessary or
appropriate, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
401(k) plan to accept qualified direct rollovers of the participant accounts
(including loans) maintained on behalf of any Covered Employee to Purchasers
401(k) plan. This _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ shall inure exclusively to the benefit
of, and be binding solely upon, the parties and their respective successors,
permitted assigns, executors and legal representatives. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, express or implied, shall be construed to create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any Covered
Employees, former employees, service providers, any participant or any
beneficiary thereof in any compensation related obligation, Company Benefit
Plan or any other plan or arrangement of Purchaser, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries or any such Persons alternate payees, dependents or
beneficiaries, whether in respect of continued employment or resumed
employment, compensation, employee benefits or otherwise.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, to terminate each of the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 7.2(d)_ in accordance with its
terms and applicable Law, effective as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 

7.3 _Closing Date Borrowings_. Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain funds sufficient to fund the aggregate Cash
Consideration and the funds otherwise necessary to effect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the date upon
which the Closing is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, as promptly as possible, all things necessary,

 



62  proper or advisable to obtain the Closing Date Borrowings on the terms and
conditions described in the Purchaser Credit Agreement, including maintaining
in effect the Purchaser Credit Agreement and using reasonable best efforts
to, as promptly as possible, satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Purchaser obtaining the Closing Date Borrowings and consummate
the Closing Date Borrowings no later than the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to Seller true, complete and correct copies of any amendment
or modification to the Purchaser Credit Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that neither the Closing Date Borrowings nor the Debt Financing is
a condition to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Closing Date Borrowings or the Debt Financing, subject
to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

7.4 _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_. Subject to Purchasers receipt of
the Required Company Information, Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts
to prepare and file an automatic shelf registration statement (within the
meaning of such term in Instruction I.D to  _Form_ S-3) with the SEC covering
the resale of Purchaser Securities as soon as practicable following the
Closing but in any event no later than the date which is later of (i) the
Closing Date, and (ii) ten (10) days following Purchasers receipt from the
Company of the Required Company Information.

action as may reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably
request to satisfy the conditions of _Article IX_ or otherwise to comply with
this Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon
as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any material expense or pay
any material fee or grant any material concession in connection with obtaining
any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.2  _HSR Act and Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and Purchaser shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its
Affiliates to) (i) comply

 



63  promptly but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof with the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act, and
(ii) make other appropriate filings necessary to any Governmental Authority
as disclosed on _Schedule 5.5_ as promptly as practicable; _provided_ , that
neither party shall request early termination of any waiting period under the
HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other party. The Company and
Purchaser shall substantially comply with any Information or Document Requests
as promptly as practicable.

 

(b) The Company and Purchaser shall exercise their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) obtain termination or expiration of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, (ii) prevent the entry in any Action brought by a Regulatory
Consent Authority or any other Person of any Governmental Order which would
prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) if any such
Governmental Order is issued in any such Action, cause such Governmental Order
to be lifted. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Purchaser be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action
that will in any way limit the right of Purchaser to own or operate all or
any portion of its assets, properties or businesses or the assets, properties
or businesses being acquired pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall not
discuss, negotiate or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss
or commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Purchasers freedom of
action with respect Purchasers assets, properties or businesses or the
assets, properties or businesses being acquired pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) The Company and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the other copies of
any notices or written communications received from any third party or any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company and Purchaser shall permit counsel to the other
an opportunity to review in advance, and shall consider in good faith the
views of such counsel in connection with, any proposed written communications
to any Governmental Authority concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;  _provided_ , that neither the Company nor Purchaser shall extend
any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority without the written consent of the
other. Purchaser agrees to provide the Company and its counsel the
opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive
meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone with any
Governmental Authority concerning or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of
all filing fees payable to the Regulatory Consent Authorities in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.3 _Potential IP_ _Transaction_. The parties agree and acknowledge that, to
the extent the Company enters into a printer IP license agreement (or any
substantially similar agreement) with the business entity set forth on
_Schedule 8.3_ (or an Affiliate thereof) prior to the Closing Date, the
Company may be entitled to receive aggregate cash payments of up to
$5,000,000. The parties agree and acknowledge that twenty-five percent (25%)
of any such payment shall be

 



64  delivered to the Company to be used for the benefit of the Companys
employees, with the remainder of any such payment (i.e., seventy-five percent
(75%)) to be distributed to Seller prior to the Closing Date (or promptly
paid directly to Seller by the Company if any portion of such payment is
received by the Company within the twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date).

 

8.4 _Tax Matters_.

(a) All Tax Returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries required to
be filed for the periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be
prepared and filed (or caused to be prepared and filed) by Seller, and Seller
shall pay all Taxes due in connection with such Tax Returns. Unless otherwise
required by Law, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the most recent past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All
Tax Returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries required to be filed
for the periods ending after the Closing Date for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning on or prior to the Closing Date shall be prepared
and filed (or caused to be prepared and filed) by Purchaser. Unless
otherwise required by Law, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the most recent past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall deliver such Tax Returns to Seller, for Sellers
review and comment no later than twenty (20) days before the filing date for
each such Tax Return. Purchaser shall incorporate any reasonable comments of
Seller that are received by Purchaser within ten (10) days after Purchasers
delivery of the applicable Tax Return to Seller into the final Tax Return
prior to filing. No failure or delay of Purchaser in providing such Tax
Returns for Sellers review shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations
or liabilities of Seller pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent
Seller is actually prejudiced by such delay or failure.

(b) Purchaser will timely file all Tax Returns and other documentation
necessary with respect to all Transfer Taxes and, to the extent required by
Law, the parties hereto will cooperate in the execution of such Tax Returns
and other documentation. Seller and Purchaser shall each pay fifty percent
(50%) of all Transfer Taxes incurred by the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates and
employees to, cooperate fully, as reasonably requested by the other parties,
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date or any Straddle Period, the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim and
the provision of any information necessary or reasonably requested to allow
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with
any information reporting or withholding requirements contained in the Code
or other applicable Laws or to compute the amount of payroll or other
employment Taxes due with respect to any payment made in connection with this
Agreement. Such cooperation shall include the retention of and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably
relevant to Tax matters and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information. 

(d) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates of any written notice
from a Taxing Authority of an Action with respect to Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which may give rise to an Indemnification Claim
relating to Taxes for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may be 

 



65  entitled to indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)_ (such Action, a " _Tax
Contest_ "). Such notice shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the relevant Taxing Authority. No failure or
delay of Purchaser in providing such notice to Seller shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of Seller pursuant to this
Agreement except to the extent Seller is actually prejudiced by such delay or
failure. Seller shall have the right to control any Tax Contest that is solely
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller
shall promptly give notice of its intent to control such Tax Contest to
Purchaser, (ii) Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right
to participate in any such Tax Contest and (iii) Seller shall not settle or
otherwise resolve any Tax Contest if such settlement or other resolution
would reasonably be expected to impact any Taxes (or Tax Returns) of
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Post-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date)
without the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied). The Company or its applicable
Subsidiary shall control all Tax Contests not controlled by Seller; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall
have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) Purchaser shall not allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to settle or otherwise resolve any Tax Contest if such
settlement or other resolution relates to Indemnified Taxes for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period without the consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied).

(e) After the Closing, except with the prior written consent of Seller,
Purchaser agrees not to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates not to, (i) file
any amended Tax Return, (ii) change any Tax election or any Tax accounting
method, (iii) adopt any Tax accounting method or make any Tax election, in
each case, inconsistent with past practices, (iv) change any annual Tax
accounting period, (v) agree to extend any statute of limitations for Taxes,
(vi) settle any right to a Pre-Closing Tax Refund or other Tax benefit, or
(vii) initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to Taxes, in each case,
if such action is with respect to a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and would increase the amount of entitlement of any Purchaser
Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or would
decrease the amount of entitlement of Seller with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Refund of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) Purchaser agrees to cause the Company to pay to Seller the amount of any
Tax refund (without any interest except any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto by the applicable Governmental Authority and net of (i) any
Taxes (including any Taxes imposed on a distribution of any portion of such
refund to the Company) and (ii) any out-of-pocket expenses that Purchaser, the
Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates incur with
respect to such refund (and related interest)) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date) (x) promptly upon the receipt of such Tax refund
or (y) when used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to credit an
account with a Taxing Authority or to offset any Taxes of the Company for any
Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date) (each of (x) and (y), a " _Pre-Closing Tax Refund_").
Purchaser agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund. Purchaser agrees
to permit Seller to participate (at its expense) in the efforts to obtain
any Pre-Closing Tax Refund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 8.4(f)_ shall

 



66  require that Purchaser make any payment with respect to any refund for a Tax
(and such refunds shall be for the benefit of Purchaser, the Company, and its
Subsidiaries) that is with respect to (A) any refund of Tax that is the
result of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute
or Tax credit incurred in a Post-Closing Period (or the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date); (B) any refund of an
Indemnified Tax paid after the Closing Date to the extent Seller has not
indemnified Purchaser, Company, or the applicable Subsidiary for such
Indemnified Taxes; (C) any refund for Tax that is reflected as a current asset
(or offset to a current liability) on the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
as finally determined; or (D) any refund for Tax that gives rise to a payment
obligation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person under
applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other agreement
entered (or assumed) by the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) on or prior
to the Closing Date.

 

(g) Within ninety (90) days following the final determination of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a purchase price
allocation in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and
the allocation methodologies on _Schedule 8.4(g)_ (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation_ ") for Sellers review and comment. Such Purchase Price
Allocation shall (i) first allocate value among (x) the assets of the Company
(other than equity in the Companys Subsidiaries) and (y) each of the
Companys Subsidiaries, and (ii) second, with respect to such Company
Subsidiaries that are disregarded for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and
with respect to Conexant Systems Worldwide, Inc. for which the Section
338(h)(10) Election is made) further allocate the value allocated to such
entity among the assets of such entity. In the event Seller does not provide
Purchaser with comments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule within
forty-five (45) calendar days from its receipt thereof, such allocation shall
be deemed final and agreed by the parties hereto. In the event that Seller
provides comments within such forty-five (45) day period, the parties will
negotiate in good faith to agree on a final allocation schedule. If the
parties cannot agree on a final allocation schedule within such forty-five
(45) day negotiation period, then the parties hereto shall each prepare their
own allocation. If, and only if, the parties agree on a Purchase Price
Allocation pursuant hereto, the parties shall report such Purchase
Price Allocation with their Tax Returns and agree not to take a position
inconsistent therewith in any filing, reporting, proceeding, audit or similar
dispute unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" as described
in Section 1313 of the Code. If the parties do not agree on a Purchase Price
Allocation pursuant hereto, then each party may take any position it desires
in connection with any Tax Return, filing, reporting, proceeding, audit or
similar dispute. 

(h) For purposes of determining the amount of Taxes that are attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date) the parties agree as follows:

(i) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period;

 



67 (ii) In the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all such
Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) to the extent
relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such items are incurred, accrued,
assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

 

(iii) In the case of Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of income
of any Flow-Thru Entity realized prior to the Closing Date (such income being
computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the Closing
Date and closed its books), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(iv) In the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including income
Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) the amount attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined as if the Company or its applicable Subsidiary filed a separate
Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the
books methodology." For purposes of clause this clause (iv), any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on
the mechanics set forth in clause (i) for periodic Taxes.

(i) _Code Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(i) Seller shall join, in an appropriate and timely manner, with Purchaser in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding
election permitted under the applicable Laws of any local, state or non-U.S.
jurisdiction (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with
respect to Purchasers indirect acquisition of the shares of Conexant Systems
Worldwide, Inc. (the " _Worldwide Shares_ ").

 

(ii) Purchaser and each Seller shall take all actions necessary or appropriate
to effect and preserve a timely Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to
Purchasers indirect acquisition of the Worldwide Shares, including, but not
limited to, participating in the timely filing of IRS Form 8023 and related or
comparable forms for state, local, or non-U.S. Law purposes (collectively, the
" _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_ ").

 

(iii) Purchaser shall prepare all Section 338(h)(10) Forms and shall provide
them to Seller for execution prior to the Closing. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with all of the information required to prepare all Section
338(h)(10) Forms, including, with respect to the IRS Form 8023, (A) the
information regarding the common parent of Seller in Section C of the IRS Form
8023, and (B) the information regarding Conexant Systems Worldwide, Inc. in
Section B. Seller shall promptly and properly complete and execute all of the
forms Purchaser provides and return the appropriately executed copies to
Purchaser for timely filing by Purchaser with the applicable Governmental
Authority.

 



68 (j) Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto agree to treat for
all Tax purposes all payments under this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ and all
indemnification payments under _Article XI_ as adjustments to the Purchase
Price.

 

8.5 _Non-Solicitation; No Hire; Non-Disparagement_.

 

(a) During the period of one (1) year commencing on the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), neither Lakestar nor Seller shall, and each shall
cause their respective controlled Affiliates operating in the semiconductor
industry and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit for
hiring or hire any employee of Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any person who was an employee of Purchaser, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the ninety (90) days immediately preceding such
solicitation or hire (unless such employees employment or business
relationship with Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, was terminated by Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), or (ii) knowingly encourage any employee of Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any person who was an employee or
independent contractor of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
the ninety (90) days immediately preceding such encouragement, to discontinue
employment with Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (unless
such employees or independent contractors employment or business
relationship with Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, was terminated by Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries); _provided,_ that neither Lakestar nor Seller shall be
prevented from soliciting or hiring, or taking any other action with respect
to any such individual who responds to general or public solicitation not
targeted at employees of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is referred by search firms, employment agencies or similar entities so long
as such entities have not been instructed by Seller or Lakestar to target
employees of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither Lakestar nor Seller shall be restricted from engaging
in general or public solicitations or advertising not targeted at any such
Persons described above or from using search firms, employment agencies or
similar entities so long as such entities have not been instructed by Seller
or Lakestar to target employees of Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, neither Lakestar nor Seller shall, and shall
instruct their respective Affiliates operating in the semiconductor industry
not to, directly or indirectly, knowingly induce or knowingly attempt to
induce any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or other
business relation of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
cease doing business with Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or in any way knowingly and intentionally interfere with the relationship
between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that
any term or provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of such term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

contemplated hereby abandoned:

such that the conditions specified in _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_
would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Company Breach_ "),
except that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by Lakestar, Seller

11.2 _Indemnification_.

 



74 (a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, from and
after the Closing, Lakestar and Seller shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, members, equityholders, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assignees (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") for any and all Damages to the extent

plus any amount for employer Taxes related directly to the New Unvested SARs
or (B) solely to the extent not previously paid by Seller to Purchaser

(including social security, Medicare and unemployment) related thereto in the
calculation of such $10.0 million), plus the Seller Unvested SARs Employer
Tax Amount, if any, (v) solely to the extent not accounted for in the

any Damages related to Third Party Claims arising from the Known
Environmental Conditions other than Third Party Claims arising from toxic tort

the Known Litigation Matters, but solely to the extent that such Damages

(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude damages based on loss of
enterprise value, damage to reputation, loss relating to lost opportunity or
loss of goodwill or lost revenue or lost profits) solely related to Third

avoidance of doubt, with respect to any liability related to Unvested SARs,
Purchaser shall be responsible for the first $10.0 million (without taking
into consideration the employer portion of any and all payroll and employment
Taxes (including social security, Medicare and unemployment) related thereto
in the calculation of such $10.0 million) of the Unvested SARs Settlement
Amount (after taking into consideration the Forfeited Unvested SARs Amount)
plus the employer portion of all payroll and employment Taxes (including
social security, Medicare and unemployment) related to the payment of such
first $10.0 million of the Unvested SARs Settlement Amount, and Seller shall

$10.0 million (without taking into consideration the employer portion of any
and all payroll and employment Taxes (including social security, Medicare and

 



75  unemployment) related thereto in the calculation of such amount in excess of
$10.0 million) plus the Seller Unvested SARs Employer Tax Amount, if any.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lakestar, Seller and their
respective Affiliates, members, equityholders, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") for any and all Damages to the extent
arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Purchaser has
made in this Agreement, or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Purchaser prior to or at
the Closing or by Purchaser or the Company after the Closing.

11.3 _Third Party Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) Upon receipt of any notice of an Action by a third party that may give
rise to an Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), such Indemnified
Party shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the
Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in reasonable detail the nature of
the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers served with respect to such
Action, (C) including the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of
Damages that may arise from such Action (to the extent practicable), and (D)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Partys request
for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this _Section 11.3(a)_ will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to
give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor
of such Indemnification Claim in accordance with this _Section 11.3(a)_ prior
to the applicable Survival Expiration Date.

 

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any Indemnification Claim relating to a
third party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") (except for any Tax Contest
Claim, which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _
11.3_, shall be exclusively governed by _Section 8.4(d)_ ) with counsel of
the Indemnitors choice; _provided_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume control of such defense and the reasonable and documented
fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party in connection
with such defense shall constitute Damages hereunder (i) if the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Action,
indictment or allegation; (ii) with respect to the defense of the
Known Litigation Matters ( _provided_ , that Purchaser agrees that the
outside legal counsel currently representing the Company with respect to the
Known Litigation Matters will not be removed or replaced without the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied) or any Third Party Claim involving
the Known Potential Litigation; (iii) if the claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (iv) if, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Third Party Claim involves the Known Environmental Conditions in
which case Purchaser shall have sole control and management authority over the
resolution of such claim, subject to Purchaser complying with the conditions
set forth in _Section 11.4(b)_ ; (v) if upon petition by the Indemnified
Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnitor failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; or (vi) if the Indemnified Party
shall have

 



76  reasonably concluded (in the opinion of counsel) that there is an actual
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor in the
conduct of such defense. In the event the Indemnitor elects to conduct the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_, the
Indemnitor may settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim, and each
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such
defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims,
counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with the
Third Party Claim) and/or the settlement of such Third Party Claim by
the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor will not agree
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior
written approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld, delayed or denied), unless the terms of such settlement (i) do not
involve injunctive or other equitable relief shall be imposed against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) provide for a complete and unconditional release of
the claims that are the subject of such Third Party Claim in favor of the
Indemnified Party without any liabilities or obligations (including continuing
liabilities or obligations) with respect to such claims, without prejudice.
If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification
Claim and the Indemnitor does not thereafter promptly assume such defense or
is not permitted to assume such defense pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 11.3(b)_ , then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (x) until the later of the
applicable Survival Expiration Date or the date upon which the Indemnitor has
no further potential indemnification obligations with respect to such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnitor reasonably
informed of any material developments and, on a reasonably regular basis, the
status of any such Third Party Claim, and (y) the Indemnified Party will not
agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise
with respect to such Third Party Claim (other than with respect to the
adoption or implementation of the existing "pilot" remediation plan arising
from the Known Environmental Conditions with respect to which Seller shall
have no consent rights) without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or
denied).

(c) In circumstances where the Indemnitor is controlling the defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section 11.3(b)_ , the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to
employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which case the fees
and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party. To the extent there is a conflict between this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_
and _Section 8.4(d)_ , the provisions of _Section 8.4(d)_ shall control with
respect to any Tax matter.

(d) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates (including Indemnification Claims made pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_). All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.

 

11.4 _Direct Claim Procedures_ _; Remediation_.

 



77 (a) In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under 
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_ against an Indemnitor that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of
such claim to the Indemnitor. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail such claim and the basis for indemnification together with any
documents, communications or calculations supporting, relating to, or forming
the basis of, such Indemnification Claim. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ will not relieve the Indemnitor
of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the
extent (i) such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnitor or (ii) the
Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification
Claim in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ prior to the applicable
Survival Expiration Date.

 

(b) With respect to the investigation, remediation, monitoring and operation
and maintenance relating to the Known Environmental Conditions, Purchaser
agrees that (i) it will not seek to remove or replace the consultants,
including Geosyntec Consultants, Inc., or agency responsible for overseeing
same (the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board), (ii) nor will it
seek to terminate the pilot field test currently in process that will
ultimately assist in determining the groundwater remedy, (iii) nor will it
initiate voluntary contact with any other Governmental Authority with regard
to the Known Environmental Conditions unless required by Environmental Laws,
in each case (i), (ii) and (iii), without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or
denied). In addition, until the later of the applicable Survival Expiration
Date or the date upon which the Indemnitor has no further potential
indemnification obligations with respect to the Known Environmental
Conditions, Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of any
material developments and, on a reasonably regular basis, the status of the
investigation, remediation, monitoring and operation and maintenance relating
to the Known Environmental Conditions.

 

11.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this _Article XI_ will be limited as follows:

(a) _Indemnification Cap_. Except with respect to indemnification for Damages
that relate to any breach of a Fundamental Representation, Tax Representation
or the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12(l)_ ( _SARs
Schedule_ ) or _Section 3.12(m)_ ( _Transaction Bonuses_ ), or Fraud or
willful misconduct of Lakestar or Seller, the aggregate amount of Damages for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ ,
_Section 11.2(a)(viii)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ix)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(x)_ and
_Section 11.2(a)(xi)_ will not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount. The
Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow shall serve as the sole
and exclusive source of payment of any Indemnification Claim pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ , except with respect to
indemnification for Damages that relate to any breach of a Fundamental
Representation, a Tax Representation or the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 3.12(l)_ ( _SARs Schedule_ ) or _Section 3.12(m)_ (
_Transaction Bonuses_ ), or Fraud or willful misconduct of Lakestar or Seller;
_provided_ , that, any claim made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to this _Article XI_ related to a breach of a Fundamental Representation, a
Tax Representation, or the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.12(l)_ ( _SARs Schedule_ ) or _Section 3.12(m)_ ( _Transaction
Bonuses_ ) or Fraud or willful misconduct of Lakestar or Seller shall be (i)
paid first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount

 



78  then remaining in escrow and (ii) then, subject to the terms and conditions
of this _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, paid directly by Seller. Any claim made by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(viii)_ , _Section
11.2(a)(ix)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(x)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(xi)_ shall be (i)
paid first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow
and (ii) then, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _
11.5_, paid directly by Seller (solely to the extent that all or part of the
Escrow Funds have been released to Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.7_
and only as it relates to such released Escrow Funds). Disregarding any
payments of Indemnification Escrow Funds to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties,
the total amount of indemnification payments that Seller shall be required to
make to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall not exceed the amount of the Seller
Proceeds actually received by Seller as of the date of determination. For the
avoidance of doubt, the total amount of indemnification payments that Seller
shall be required to make to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, inclusive of
any amounts paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, in respect of
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(viii)_ ,
_Section 11.2(a)(ix)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(x)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(xi)_ , shall
not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

 

(b) _Claims Basket_. Except with respect to indemnification for Damages that
relate to any breach of a Fundamental Representation, Tax Representation or
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12(l)_ ( _SARs
Schedule_ ) or _Section 3.12(m)_ ( _Transaction Bonuses_ ), or Fraud or
willful misconduct of Lakestar or Seller, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ ,
_Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(ix)_ unless and until the amount of
Damages (excluding costs and expenses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
incurred in connection with making such claim under this Agreement) incurred
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, individually or in the aggregate,
exceeds $3,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(ix)_ (other
than with respect to indemnification for Damages that relate to any breach of
a Fundamental Representation, Tax Representation or the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.12(l)_ ( _SARs Schedule_ ) or _Section
3.12(m)_ ( _Transaction Bonuses_ ), or Fraud or willful misconduct of Lakestar
or Seller) to the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages (excluding costs
and expenses of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with
making such claim under this Agreement) incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ and
_Section 11.2(a)(ix)_ exceeds such Deductible Amount. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
for any Damages pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 11.2(a)(ix)_ (other than with respect to indemnification for Damages
that relate to any breach of a Fundamental Representation, Tax Representation
or the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12(l)_ ( _SARs
Schedule_ ) or _Section 3.12(m)_ ( _Transaction Bonuses_ ), or Fraud or
willful misconduct of Lakestar or Seller), the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
will only be entitled to indemnification under this _Article XI_ in respect of
such Damages to the extent the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the
Deductible Amount, and in that case, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will
only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages in excess of Deductible
Amount.

(c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party Recoveries_. All
Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under

 



79  this _Article XI_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries to which any
Indemnified Party is actually paid in respect of any Damages incurred by such
Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
is entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-party
recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article XI_ , such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits,
payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are obtained, received or
realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to
which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant
Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification
payment.

(d) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XI_ and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a
" _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against
the Indemnifying Party, at the election of the Indemnitor, such Indemnified
Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its claims for recovery against
any Potential Contributor as to such Damages, whether by insurance coverage,
contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

(e) _Consequential, Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. No Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification for any (i) consequential, indirect,
incidental special, punitive or exemplary damages (except to the extent
actually paid by such Indemnified Party to a third party), or (ii) diminution
in value of any business. In valuing Damages, the parties agree that no
adjustment shall be made as a result of any multiple, increase factor, or any
premium over fair market, book, or historical value that may have been
factored into Purchasers decisions relating to the Purchase Price, regardless
of whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been
used by Purchaser at the time of, or in connection with, calculating its
Purchase Price or any proposal or bid relating thereto.

 

(f) _Damages Reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet or Included in Purchase
Price_. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
for any Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or
reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet, or (ii) in respect of any liability
included in the calculation of Closing Cash Consideration or Seller Proceeds
(or, in each case, the components thereof).

(g) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event a Purchaser Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of
an Indemnification Claim, no other Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, may recover the same Damages in respect of a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

(h) _Limitations on Tax Indemnification_. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
be indemnified for Damages for Taxes to the extent of any Taxes attributable
to any breach of any covenant hereunder by Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 



80 (i) _Materiality_. For purposes of determining the amount of any indemnifiable
Damages under  _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ , _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section
11.2(b)(i)_ resulting from the breach of any representation and warranty (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether there has
been a breach of any such representation or warranty) the terms "Material
Adverse Effect," "materiality," or other terms of similar import or effect in
any such representation and warranty shall be disregarded and given no effect.

 

11.6 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, claims under this 
_Article XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (x) in the case of Fraud
in connection with making the representations and warranties of Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, (y) in connection with a dispute or payment obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ ( _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ) (such dispute or
payment obligation to be governed exclusively by _Section_ __ _ 2.6_), or
(z) in connection with a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ ( _Indemnification and Insurance_ ),  _Section_ __ _
7.2_ ( _Employment Matters_ ), _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ ( _Resale Shelf
Registration Statement_ ), _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ ( _Potential IP Transaction_
),  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ ( _Tax Matters_ ), _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ ( _Non-
Solicitation; No Hire; Non-Disparagement_) and  _Section_ __ _ 11.7_ (
_Release of Escrow_ ) (in which case it is accordingly agreed that the parties

performance or other equitable relief to prevent or cure a breach or
threatened breach of such provisions and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.14_ (
_Enforcement_ )) (the foregoing (x)  (z), the " _Exclusive Remedy
Exceptions_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Purchaser, on behalf
of itself and each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf
of itself and each of the Seller Indemnified Parties, hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims, and causes of action it may have against any
indemnifying party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement based
upon predecessor or successor liability, contribution, tort, strict liability
or any Law or otherwise (except with respect to the Exclusive Remedy
Exceptions). All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies
set forth in this _Article XI_ (except with respect to the Exclusive Remedy
Exceptions). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Agreement, including the Exclusive Remedy
Exceptions, Purchaser hereby waives any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters);

 

(b) after the Closing Date, none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this _Article XI_
were specifically bargained for between the parties hereto and were taken
into account by the parties hereto in arriving at the Purchase Price;

 



81 (d) the parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the transactions contemplated hereby
exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this
Agreement;

 

(e) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be those remedies
available at Law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such
contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the
express terms of this Agreement); and

 

(f) the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms-length negotiations, and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge
that no party hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto
that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an
ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall not be considered "remedies" for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.6_ and shall not be limited by the terms
of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.6_.

11.7 _Release of Escrow_. The Indemnification Escrow Funds (if any) shall be
released to Seller on the second (2nd) Business Day following September 30,
2018; _provided_ , that, if any Indemnification Claim shall have been properly
asserted by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement
on or prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date and remains pending as
of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on September 30, 2018 (any such claim, a " _Pending
Claim_ "), (i) the Indemnification Escrow Funds released to Seller shall be
the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow Agent,
_minus_ the aggregate amount of such Pending Claim and (ii) any funds that
remain in escrow following September 30, 2018 in respect of any such Pending
Claim shall be released to Seller and/or Purchaser, as applicable, promptly
upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such Pending Claim. In each
case in which this _Section_ __ _ 11.7_ provides for the release of
Indemnification Escrow Funds, each of Purchaser and Seller shall promptly
submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to distribute the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 11.7_ and the Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE XII.

consult with each other prior to making such disclosure and will consider in
good faith any comments provided by the other party).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 12.11(a)_ ,
Purchaser agrees that in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,

Seller or Lakestar name or the name of any of their respective Affiliates, for
any purpose whatsoever, without the prior written consent of Seller with
respect to each such use or reference.

 

12.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or

12.13 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Subject to _Section 12.6(b)_ ,
any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction,
any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State
of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and
determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the
right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to

brought pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

12.14 _Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
prior to Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_ (for all aspects of this Agreement), and on and
after Closing (solely with respect to the Exclusive Remedy Exceptions), (a)
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none
of Lakestar, Seller, the Company or Purchaser would have entered into this
Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge
and agree that, on or prior to Closing or the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ (for all aspects of
this Agreement) and on and after Closing (solely with respect to the Exclusive
Remedy Exceptions), any party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction.

 



87 (b) To the extent any party hereto brings any Action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended by the greater of (i) the
amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business
Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such Action.

12.15 _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to
the extent permitted under _Section_ __ _ 12.14_, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
only be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such party. Without limiting the rights of the Company
under and to the extent permitted under _Section_ __ _ 12.14_, except to the
extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement party),
(a) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (b) no
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of Lakestar, Seller, the Company or Purchaser
under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

12.16 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that Seller and the
Company have retained OMelveny and Myers LLP (" _OMM_ ") to act as their
counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that OMM
has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for conflict of interest or any other
purposes. Purchaser and the Company agree that any attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of OMMs
representation of the Company and Seller related to the preparation for, and
negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all communications among OMM and the Company, Seller,
Lakestar and/or their respective Affiliates related to the preparation for,
and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect.
Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and
materials relating thereto) between the Company and its Subsidiaries and OMM
related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and
transferred to Seller, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby release
all of their respective rights and interests to and in such communications and
related materials and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby release
any right to assert or waive any privilege related to the communications
referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 12.16_ and the Company and its Subsidiaries
acknowledge and agree that all such rights shall reside with Seller.

 



88 (b) Purchaser and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any current, prior
or future representation of the Company by OMM, OMM shall be allowed to
represent Seller, Lakestar or any of their respective Affiliates in any
matters and disputes adverse to Purchaser or the Company that either is
existing on the date hereof or arises in the future and relates to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and Purchaser and the
Company hereby waive any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise in
connection with such representation. Further, Purchaser and the Company agree
that, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing between Purchaser or
the Company and Seller, Lakestar or any of their respective Affiliates, OMM
may represent Seller, Lakestar or such Affiliate in such dispute even though
the interests of Seller, Lakestar or such Affiliate may be directly adverse
to Purchaser or the Company and even though OMM may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with
Seller, Lakestar or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Company) shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely
by Seller, Lakestar and any such Affiliate of each such party. Purchaser and
the Company each hereby acknowledge that each of them have had the opportunity
to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and
material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers,
permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity
to consult with counsel other than OMM.
