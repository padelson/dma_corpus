Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender
offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (such shares of Company
Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Shares_ "), at a price
per Share of $11.50, net to the seller thereof in cash, without interest, and
subject to deduction for any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
(such amount or any other amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the
Offer, and as may be adjusted in accordance with  _Section 1.1(b)_, the "

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the

_2.5(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger will be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation

to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the limited guarantee of Francisco
Partners IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, and
Francisco Partners IV-A, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership,
(collectively, the " _Sponsor_ "), dated as of the Agreement Date, in favor of
the Company with respect to certain obligations of Purchaser and Parent under
this Agreement (the " _Guarantee_ ") as specified in the Guarantee;

 



-1- WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser and Parent have
unanimously approved and declared advisable this Agreement, and the

_AGREEMENT_

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

_ARTICLE 1 _

_THE OFFER_

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a)  _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_, as promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement
Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase for
cash all of the Shares at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of the Companys stockholders and
contains a description of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and _Annex A._

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for purchase any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction (or to the extent
waivable, the waiver by Parent or Purchaser) of only the conditions set forth
in _Annex A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Purchaser expressly reserves the
right (but is not obligated to) at any time, and from time to time, in its
sole discretion to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer,
except that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price; (ii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer; (iii) reduce the number of shares of
Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer; (iv) amend or modify any of
the Offer Conditions in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares or
impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to the
Offer Conditions; (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition; or (vi) extend or
otherwise change any time period for the performance of any obligation of
Parent or Purchaser (including the Expiration Time) in a manner other than
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth (20th)
Business Day (calculated in accordance with

 



-2-  Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is
commenced (the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, if the period of time for
which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and in
accordance with, this _Section 1.1(c)_, or as may be required by applicable
Law, the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Time, or, to the extent applicable, such later time and date to
which the Offer has been extended, the " _Expiration Time_ "). Purchaser shall
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or NASDAQ
applicable to the Offer (including in order to comply with Rule 14e-1(b) under
the Exchange Act in respect of any change in the Offer Price). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the
parties respective termination rights under _Article 7_ , if as of any
scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person),
extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of up to
ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may
agree in writing), until such time as all Offer Conditions are satisfied or
waived; _provided, however_ , that, without the Companys written consent,
Purchaser shall not extend the Offer beyond the earlier of the Outside Date
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_. If,
(A) as of any scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition (other than the
Minimum Condition) is not satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or
Purchaser or (B) as of any scheduled Expiration Time, all Offer Conditions
(exclusive of the Minimum Condition) have been satisfied or waived by Parent
or Purchaser, then on every occasion under clause (A) and on not more than two
(2) occasions under clause (B), in each case at the request of the Company,
Purchaser shall extend the Offer for an additional period of ten (10) Business
Days (or such longer or shorter period as the parties hereto may agree in
writing) to permit such Offer Condition(s) to be satisfied; _provided,
however_ , that, without the Companys prior written consent, Purchaser shall
not extend the Offer, and without Purchasers prior written consent, Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer, in each case beyond the earlier of
the Outside Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_.

(d)  _Consummation of the Offer; Paymen_ t. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer, irrevocably accept for purchase all
Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the Expiration Time (the time of such acceptance,
the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and thereafter pay for all Shares validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after
the Expiration Time and, in any event, no later than three (3) Business Days
after the consummation of the Offer. The time scheduled for payment for Shares
accepted for purchase pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_." Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid
net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to the withholding of
any Taxes required by applicable Law.

(e) _Termination of the Offer_. Purchaser shall not terminate or withdraw the
Offer prior to the Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the
Company, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_. In the event that this 

 



-3-  Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer, not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto, and cause any depositary
acting on its behalf to promptly return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. 

(f) _Offer Documents_. On the commencement date of the Offer, Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file, or cause to be filed, with the SEC, in accordance
with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") that will contain or incorporate by
reference the Offer to Purchase, the form of the related letter of
transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively,
and together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Schedule TO and related Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares in accordance with
applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Companys stockholders
that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably requested in connection
with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(f)_. The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and
Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the Company or its counsel. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. Upon receipt of any written or
oral comments by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Purchaser agree to (i)
promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any such written
comments (or a description of any such oral comments); (ii) provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed
response thereto, and give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments made by the Company or its counsel; (iii) provide the Company and its
counsel an opportunity to participate with Parent, Purchaser or their counsel
in any material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv)
provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments or
responses submitted by Parent or Purchaser in response thereto.

(g) _Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer,
unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company, any Shares
subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly
tendered into the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of
guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Purchaser.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC
or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree, the
Company shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on

 



-4-  Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject
to  _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ and _Section 5.4(d)(ii)_, shall include the Company
Board Recommendation and a notice of appraisal rights in compliance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion
of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished
to holders of Shares. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to
the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that
may be required by applicable Law or reasonably requested in connection with
any actions contemplated by this _Section 1.2(a)_. Except with respect to any
amendments filed in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or after a Change
in Company Board Recommendation, the Company agrees to provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such filing of the Schedule 14D-9 shall not, unless otherwise agreed by
the Company and Parent, waive, extend or restart the notice period for
purposes of Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Upon receipt of any written or oral
comments received by the Company or its counsel from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company agrees to (i) promptly provide
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with a copy of any such written comments
(or a description of any such oral comments); (ii) provide Parent, Purchaser
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed response
thereto, and give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments
made by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel; (iii) provide Parent, Purchaser
and their counsel an opportunity to participate with the Company and its
counsel in any material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and
(iv) provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written
comments or responses submitted by the Company in response thereto.

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser with (i)
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and (ii) security position listings of Shares held in stock
depositories, each as of a recent date, and with respect to those Persons who
become record or beneficial owners subsequent to such date, as of such later
date, together with other readily available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall
furnish Parent and Purchaser with such additional information, including,
without limitation, updated listings and computer files of holders of Shares,
mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as
Parent, Purchaser or their agents may reasonably require in communicating the
Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to applicable
Law, and except for such actions as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information and
documents provided to them under this _Section 1.2(b)_, shall use such
information only in connection with

 



-5-  the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall,
upon request, promptly deliver to the Company all such information and
documents (along with all copies thereof) then in their possession or
control.

(c) _Transfer Registration_. The Company shall register, and shall instruct
its transfer agent to register, the transfer of the Shares irrevocably
accepted for purchase by Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer
Closing.

amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such
Certificate of Incorporation;

(b) the Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety as of the Effective Time

-6-  in _Exhibit C_ hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the Bylaws of the

the Certificate of Incorporation and such Bylaws; and

(c) the directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, to serve until the earlier of their respective resignations or
removals or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

 

2.5 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) all shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly owned
Company Subsidiary (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) all shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Purchaser or any
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid in
exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
_Section 2.5(b)_ , _Section 2.6(b)_ and _Section 2.9_ , each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "); and

(iv) each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) If, during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and ending at the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.6 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall assume any Company Options in
connection with the Offer, Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. At the Effective Time, each Company Option, to the extent
vested as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of Company Options, shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
promptly following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Option
Consideration, without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax. At the Effective Time, each Company Option, to the extent
unvested, shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 



-7-  " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to each Company Option, the
product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price
of such Company Option; and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that may be acquired upon exercise of such Company Option, as to which such
Company Option is vested with respect to immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price per share of any
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, such Company
Option shall be canceled and terminated without any payment being made in
respect thereof.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall assume any Other Company Equity Award
in connection with the Offer, Merger or any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, to the extent
vested as of the Effective Time (i.e., those for which Company Common Stock
has not yet been issued), and each Company RSA, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of such Company RSU or Company
RSA, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, promptly following the Effective Time, an amount in
cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding
Tax, equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over
the exercise or purchase price payable by the holder thereof, if any, upon
exercise or settlement of such Other Company Equity Award (to the extent
applicable); and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
(or deliverable under) such Other Company Equity Award. At the Effective Time,
each Company RSU, to the extent unvested, shall be cancelled for no
consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
this _Section 2.6_ shall exclusively govern the treatment of Company RSAs in
connection with the Offer, Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall issue to each Company Employee who is a
party to a PCFV Agreement a substitute award in the form attached as _Exhibit
D_ (the " _Substitute Award_ "), providing for a lump-sum cash payment to each
such Company Employee who resigns with "Good Reason" or whose employment is
terminated without "Cause" (in each such case as defined in the applicable
Substitute Award) on or prior to the one-year anniversary of the Effective
Time, equal to the PCFV Amount, subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax. Any such cash payment shall be made at the time specified in
the applicable Substitute Award.

 

(d) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.6_, including making
any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof or any administrator of an Option Plan as may be necessary.

 

2.7 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, (A) a valid certificate representing shares of Company
Common Stock, which shares were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with 

 



-8-   _Section 2.5_, (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the
Payment Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or (B) a Book-Entry
Share is surrendered in accordance with the instructions to be delivered to
the holder thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_, such Company Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in  _Section 2.8_ below.

2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_
"). At the Effective Time, or as promptly as practicable thereafter, Parent
shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to satisfy the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_. The cash amount so deposited
with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment
Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner
directed by Parent; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Shares pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or other income resulting from the investment of
such funds shall be the property of Parent.

 

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment Agent
will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such holders do not
also hold Shares that are not Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for exchange in accordance with the instructions described in the
preceding sentence, and delivery to Payment Agent of a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration; and (B) each Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.8(b)_ , each Company Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.5_. If any Company
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the
Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Company Stock Certificate.

 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is one
(1) year after the

 



-9-  Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar
Laws) for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable to any holder
of any Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share (in his or her capacity
as a holder of Company Common Stock) such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
of any Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share or to any other Person
with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

 

2.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
properly makes a demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , and the
holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect appraisal rights or otherwise), then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , without interest
thereon, upon surrender of each Company Stock Certificate representing such
shares or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon surrender of such shares in
accordance with the instructions to be delivered to holders thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.8(b)_.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal of any such demand; and (C) any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the 

 



-10-  opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its written
consent to such payment or settlement offer.

 

2.10 _Withholding_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Payment Agent to
deduct and withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of
Shares, Company Options, Other Company Equity Awards, or any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required by any applicable Law to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall take all
action as may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are
timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

2.11 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

of its business requires such qualification and where the failure to be so
qualified would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

by the Company or any Company Subsidiary before the Agreement Date
to maintain each item of material Company Registered IP have been made and

authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets. Each of Parent and
Purchaser is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (to the
extent either such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary. Parent has
delivered or made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent documents, as
amended to date, of Parent and Purchaser.

 

4.2 _Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement_. Parent has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of
this Agreement has been duly authorized by any necessary action on the part of
Parent and its board of directors. This Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligations of Parent, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to: (i) Laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors; and (ii) rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief, and other equitable
remedies. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter
into and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and the execution,
delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement has been duly
authorized by any necessary action on the part of Purchaser and its board of
directors. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject
to: (A) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the
relief of debtors; and (B) rules of Law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. Except for the adoption by
Parent (in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser) of this
Agreement following its execution, no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

4.3 _Non-Contravention; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Purchaser, nor the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will,
directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time): (i) result
in a violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of Parent or Purchaser; (ii) result in a violation by Parent or Purchaser of
any order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree to which Parent or Purchaser
is subject; or (iii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or
its Subsidiaries or any property or asset of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in each case for any violation that will not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate
the Merger.

 



-27- (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Purchaser does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
consummation by each of Parent and Purchaser of the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Body, except: (i) for applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act (including, without limitation, the filing of
the Offer Documents with the SEC), the Securities Act, and the filings
required by the DGCL (including the filing of the Certificate of Merger);
(ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect; and (iii) filings required
under the HSR Act and foreign antitrust Laws.

4.4 _No Legal Proceedings Challenging the Merger_. As of the Agreement Date,
(i) there is no Legal Proceeding pending against Parent or Purchaser
challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement; and (ii) to Parents knowledge, no Legal Proceeding has been
threatened against Parent or Purchaser challenging the Offer, the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.5 _Activities of Purchaser_. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of
effecting the Merger. Purchaser has not and will not engage in any activities
other than those contemplated by this Agreement and has, and will have as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, no liabilities other than those
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.6 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries expressly
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or the
Schedule 14D-9, at the time such documents are filed with the SEC, at any time
such documents are amended or supplemented or at the time such documents are
first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

4.7 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ , each of Parent and
Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (i) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
or any other Person, has made or is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or operations, including, with
respect to any information provided or made available to Parent, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person; and
(ii) it is not relying and has not relied on any other representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
expressed or implied.

4.8 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ ") from Sponsor pursuant to which Sponsor has
committed to invest the amounts set forth

 



-28-  therein (the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and
will continue to provide until such time as this Agreement is terminated, that
the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof and is entitled to enforce
such agreement.

(b) The Equity Commitment Letter is, as of the date hereof, in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and no such
withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is
presently contemplated other than as permitted herein. The Equity Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and Parent and
the other parties thereto. Purchaser has delivered a true and complete copy of
the Equity Commitment Letter (as amended through the date hereof). There are
no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the
Financing or the Equity Commitment Letter, including any that could affect the
availability of the Financing, to which Purchaser, Parent, Sponsor or any of
their respective Affiliates, is a party other than as expressly set forth or
referenced in the Equity Commitment Letter. No event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (x) constitute a default or
breach on the part of Purchaser, Parent or Sponsor and any of the other
parties thereto, under any term of the Equity Commitment Letter, (y) result in
a failure of any condition of the Equity Commitment Letter, or (z) result in
any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable;
_provided_ that Parent and Purchaser are not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ , or the Companys compliance
hereunder. Assuming satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, neither Parent nor
Purchaser has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Equity
Commitment Letter at the time it is required to consummate the Offer and the
Merger, nor does Parent nor Purchaser have knowledge that Sponsor will not
perform its funding obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms and conditions therein. Purchaser and Parent have
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by
the Equity Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof.
Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to
consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable) set forth in this
Agreement, the aggregate net proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient for
the satisfaction of all of Purchasers and Parents obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer
and payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8_,
all amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and the payment of all
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and to allow Purchaser and Parent to perform
all of their obligations under this Agreement. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.

(c) The obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement (i) are not
contingent upon the funding of the amount contemplated to be funded pursuant
to the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) are not subject to any conditions
regarding Parents or Purchasers ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.9 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent
has delivered to the Company the Guarantee duly executed by the Sponsor with
respect to certain

 



-29-  matters on the terms specified therein. The Sponsor has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations
under the Guarantee, and the execution, delivery and performance by the
Sponsor of the Guarantee has been duly authorized by any necessary action on
the part of the Sponsor. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Sponsor
party thereto in favor of the Company, and no event has occurred, which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the
part of the Sponsor under such Guarantee.

 

4.10 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finders, opinion, success, transaction fee or other fee or
commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
Parent or Purchaser.

 

4.11 _Interested Stockholder_. None of Parent, Purchaser, any of Parents
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or
has been at any time during the period commencing three (3) years prior to the
date that the Company Board approved this Agreement, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL.

respect to confidentiality; (y) result in a violation of applicable Law; or

5.4 _No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.4(b)_, until the earlier of the Acceptance Time and
the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not authorize or
permit its or their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly
through another Person, except as otherwise provided below in this _Section
5.4_: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or take any other action to
facilitate the making, submission or announcement of, any proposal or inquiry
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in
this _Section 5.4_, enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or
any negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or
inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or
inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or
approve, endorse or recommend or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum

proposal or inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal or which would require the 

 



-33-  Company to abandon or terminate its obligations under this Agreement, or
(iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
discussions or negotiations with any Person previously conducted with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not grant any waiver or
release under any standstill provision or similar agreement.

__(b) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to an unsolicited bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal which was made or renewed on or after the
date of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company
Board (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel) that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law: (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and such Person enter into a
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain any standstill provisions); and _provided further_ , that all
material non-public information provided or made available to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal shall have been previously provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours) after it is provided to such Person; and (B) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal. __

(c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later
than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
described in _Section 5.4(b)_, of the Companys intention to participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information
to, such Person and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms
and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of all
material developments affecting the status and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and the Company Subsidiaries
will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information
to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise prohibit the
Company from complying with its obligations under this _Section 5.4_.

 

(d) The Company Board shall not: (i) fail to make the Company Board
Recommendation to the Companys stockholders; (ii) withhold, withdraw, amend
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation; (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare
advisable the approval of any Acquisition Proposal or the adoption thereof or
any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, that would require, or
would reasonably be expected to cause the Company to abandon,
terminate, delay or

 



-34-  fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere
with or be inconsistent with, the transactions contemplated hereby, or allow
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into any such
Contract; or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions
(each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (iv)
being referred to as a " _Change in Company Board Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, take any of the actions set forth in _Sections
5.4(d)(i)-(iii)_ below; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking any
such action, the Company complies with _Section 5.4(e)_:

(i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law, and (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation if the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; and

 

(iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ and enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement, but only if the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_,
the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ or _Section 5.4(d)(ii)_; or
(ii) terminate this Agreement and enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)(iii)_, unless: (A) the Company shall have first
provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (y) make a
Change in Company Board Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "),
or (z) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ in response to
a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if
the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a
Superior Proposal, contain a description of the events, facts and
circumstances giving rise to such proposed action or, if the basis for the
proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, a description of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of
the Company Acquisition Agreement and any attachments thereto in the form to
be entered into (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of
such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company
Board Recommendation); (B) the Company shall have given Parent four (4)
Business Days after Parents receipt of the Recommendation Change Notice to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal and
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if

 



-35-  any; and (C) Parent does not make, within four (4) Business Days after the
receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good-faith judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the Companys financial advisor), cause such
events, facts and circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Company
Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, as the case may be. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no
event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt) provide to Parent copies
of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that describes the terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal. Any material changes with respect to such events, facts
or circumstances mentioned above, or material changes to the financial terms
of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company
effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ shall require the Company to provide
to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and
a new three (3) Business Day period.

(f) Nothing contained in this  _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not affect the obligations of
the Company and the Company Board and the rights of Parent and Purchaser
under _Section 5.4(d)_ and _Section 5.4(e)_, to the extent applicable to
such disclosure (it being understood that neither any "stop, look and listen"
letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or, in the case of a public Acquisition Proposal that
is not a third-party tender offer, any similar communication that does not
contain more than what would be permitted under Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act had such communication been issued in connection with a third-
party tender offer, shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Board
Recommendation).

 

5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable: (i) as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Agreement Date, an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Offer and the Merger; and (ii) as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within seven (7) Business Days) after the Agreement Date,
all other necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations
and notices with other Governmental Bodies under any other
antitrust, competition, trade regulation, or other Law relating to the Offer
and the Merger. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (A)
respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional
information made by the U.S. Department of Justice or any other Governmental

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be

or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the
other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final

incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors and
officers of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (in all of their
capacities) (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of

Company Charter Documents, the charter and organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries and the indemnification agreements in existence on the
date hereof with any directors or officers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the

indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (A) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporations or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (B) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume in writing all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

 

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Expiration Time, purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the

liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering,
without limitation, the Offer and the Merger.

 



-38- (c) Parent shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and fulfill all

entitled to the benefit of this _Section 5.7_, as applicable, identified in
Part 3.10(b)(vi) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Except as required by applicable Law, the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who

without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other
person who is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section
5.7(b)_. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 5.7(b)_ (and,
if and to the extent applicable, their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party hereto. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons (and, if and to the extent applicable, their heirs and
representatives) under this _Section 5.7_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

5.8 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other:

 

 __(a) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of such Person to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of such
party set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the other party
to consummate the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereto,
and  _provided further_ , that failure to give any such notice shall not be
treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes of _Section 2(d)_ of _Annex
A_ or _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_, as applicable; __

(b) to the extent the Company has Knowledge of such notice or communication or
Parent has knowledge of such notice or communication, as the case may be, of

Person is required in connection with the Offer or the Merger;

 

(c) of any material written communication from any Governmental Body related
to the Offer or the Merger; and

the Merger and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
shareholder litigation; and (ii) the Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any such shareholder litigation, and no settlement
shall be proposed or agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such

5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by _Article
2_ , and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company or
acquisitions of equity securities of Parent by each individual who is or will
be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

5.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.11_, (i) the term _"_ _Covered Employees_
" shall mean employees who are employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time; and (ii) the term " _Continuation Period_ " shall mean the
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of
the Effective Time.

(b) _Compensation_. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Covered Employees compensation
(such term to include salary, bonus opportunities, commissions, severance, and
other compensation, but to exclude equity compensation) and benefits
(including the costs of participation to Company Employee Plan participants)
that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and
benefits being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(c) _Benefit Plans_. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall maintain or
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements for Covered Employees that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the Company Employee Plans in
all respects (other than long-term incentives, change in control,
retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements, but including severance)
that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parents obligations under this _Section 5.11_ shall be
subject to such modifications as are necessary to comply with applicable Law
of the foreign countries and their political subdivisions, and applicable
labor agreements.

 

(d) _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or
arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (" _Parent Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to any Covered Employee under any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision benefits to the same extent
such limitation would have been waived or

 



-40-  satisfied under the employee benefit plan Covered Employee participated in
immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan; and (ii)
provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles
paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to the
same extent such credit was given under the employee benefit plan Covered
Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent
Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(e) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall
recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior to the
Effective Time, to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
entities of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries) for vesting
and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for
vacation and severance, as applicable). In no event shall anything contained
in this _Section 5.11(e)_ result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall be construed to limit the right of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
_Section 5.11_ be construed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to retain
the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of
time following the Effective Time; provided that Parent otherwise complies
with its obligations under this _Section 5.11_.

 

(g) Nothing herein shall be interpreted to provide status to any Covered
Employee as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

5.12 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that an Affiliate of Parent
and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement, dated
as of September 29, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.

 

5.13 _Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such law on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.14 _Rule 14d 10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company (acting through the Company Board,

listing rules to the extent required) will take all such steps as may be
required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding that has been
or will be entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of its
officers, directors or employees pursuant to which compensation, severance or
other

 



-41-  benefits are paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to

waiver by Parent, of all conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and (iv)
fully enforcing each Sponsors obligations (and the rights of Parent and
Purchaser) under the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other
provision or remedy under the Equity Commitment Letter without the prior
written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in the
Companys sole discretion), to the extent such amendments, modifications or
waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of aggregate cash proceeds
available from the Financing, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions
precedent or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions
precedent or other terms therein in a manner adverse to Purchaser, Parent or
the Company, including any expansion, waiver, amendment or modification that
would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of
Purchaser and Parent to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) adversely impact the ability of the
Company, Purchaser or Parent to enforce its rights or remedies against the
other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter or (C) make the timely funding
of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the
Financing any less likely to occur. Parent shall promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) notify the Company of (i) any amendment, waiver
or modification, or agreement to do any of the foregoing, of any term of the
Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) the expiration or termination (or attempted or
purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Equity Commitment Letter,
or (iii) any refusal by the Sponsor to provide, any stated intent by the
Sponsor to refuse to provide, or any expression of concern or reservation by

financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter. Neither Purchaser nor
Parent shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the
lenders and other Persons under the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

5.16 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the arrangement and consummation of any third-party debt financing for
the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that
such requested cooperation does not 

 



-42- _ _ unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations or business of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), including: (i) participating in meetings,
presentations, marketing sessions (including with ratings agencies) and due
diligence sessions and promptly furnishing such reasonably available
information (including financial information) as may be reasonably requested
by Parent; (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for
presentations, memoranda and similar documents required in connection with
such financing and participating in a reasonable number of customary meetings
with potential financing sources and senior management; (iii) executing

Parent) of the Company and any Company Subsidiary with respect to solvency
matters) and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral and the
providing of guarantees (including providing reasonable and customary
information required in connection with the pledging and identification of
intellectual property to the extent specifically requested by Parent); (iv) to
the extent reasonably requested by the Parent in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the due date therefor, furnishing all documentation

potential financing sources have reasonably requested for compliance under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money-laundering rules
and regulations; and (v) obtaining the release and termination of liens on
Company and Company Subsidiary assets, _provided_ that neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to be an issuer or obligor with
respect to such financing, or incur any obligation under any such documents
or certificates that is effective, in each case, prior to the Effective Time.
Nothing herein shall require the Company to provide such cooperation described
in the foregoing sentence to the extent it would require the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give
any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it is not reimbursed or
indemnified. __

 

(b) Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
any financing (debt or otherwise, including the Financing) is not a condition
to the Offer or the Closing.

5.17 _Cash_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to any then-
scheduled Expiration Time, unless instructed by Parent in writing otherwise,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, other than with
respect to Excluded Cash: (a) liquidate any Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments into Cash and (b) transfer all Cash to a bank account of the
Company located in the United States (the " _Company Cash Account_ "). The
Company shall not transfer any Cash (other than Excluded Cash) from the
Company Cash Account to another investment or bank account of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Acceptance Time; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company shall not be required to take any such actions to the extent
that such actions, individually or taken together, after consultation with
Parent and taking into account any consent of Parent to allow transfers out of
the Company Cash Account, would or would reasonably be expected to (i) render
such Company Subsidiary insolvent, (ii) cause the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to be in violation of applicable Law, or (iii) cause a director of
the Company or of any Company Subsidiary to become liable, in the Companys
reasonable judgment, for claims by a third-party. On the date three (3)

Statement_ "), and such documentation supporting the Cash Statement as Parent
shall reasonably request. The Cash Statement shall be prepared in good faith
and be accompanied by a certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company. At the Offer Closing, the Company shall deposit with the Payment
Agent such funds from the Company Cash Account as instructed by Parent, which
funds shall be used solely for purposes of paying a portion of the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer or for purposes of paying a portion of the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and shall not be used to
satisfy any other obligation.

into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and an
Acquisition Transaction for such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated or (Y) consummates an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company
shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on
the date such transaction is consummated. For purposes of this _Section
7.3(b)_, all references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)."

(c) All payments under this _Section 7.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

(d) Subject to _Section 8.7_ and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that its receipt of the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ or  _Section 7.3(b)_, if
applicable, shall, except in the case of fraud or willful or intentional
breach by the Company, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement of Parent and Purchaser and each of their Affiliates
and Representatives.

 



-46- (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent, Purchaser, Sponsor, or any of their respective former, current
or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Parent Related Parties_ ") have any liability for monetary damages to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current
or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Representatives or Affiliates (whether at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than Sponsors obligations
under the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than
the obligations of Parent and Purchaser as provided herein. In no event shall
the Company seek or obtain, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives to
seek or obtain, nor shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any
monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Related Party with
respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by Sponsor, Parent or
Purchaser), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other
than from Parent or Purchaser to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement or Sponsor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guarantee and
the Equity Commitment Letter. In no event shall the Company or its Affiliates
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and
monetary damages.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this  _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay the fee due pursuant to _Section 7.3_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences litigation that results
in an award against the Company for such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such litigation, together with interest on the amount of the
applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, or such
lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

 

 __8.1 _Amendment or Supplement_ __. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement, including any annex or exhibit attached hereto, may be
amended or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement signed by
all of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such amendment
shall be made or given that (i) requires the approval of the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law unless such approval is obtained; or (ii)
causes the Merger Consideration to differ from the Offer Price. __

 



-47- 8.2 _Extension of Time, Waiver, etc_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any party may, subject to applicable Law, solely as to itself: (i) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto;
(ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto; or (iii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waive compliance by any other party with any of the agreements contained in
this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, waive any
of such partys conditions set forth in this Agreement, in each case,
including agreements and conditions set forth in any annex or exhibit attached
hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

8.3 _No Survival_. None of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This _Section 8.3_ shall not limit the survival
of any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement, which by its terms, contemplates performance after the Effective
Time.

8.4  _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement,
including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the
documents and instruments relating to the Offer and the Merger referred to in
this Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed,
to create any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary hereto, except with respect to: (i) the rights of holders of
Shares to receive the Offer Price after consummation of the Offer and the
Merger Consideration after the Effective Time as provided in _Articles 1_
and  _2_ and the holders of Company Options and Other Company Equity Awards
to receive the consideration described in _Article 2_ after the Effective
Time; (ii) the directors and officers of the Company covered by _Section
5.7_; and (iii) the rights of the Parent Related Parties set forth in
_Section 7.3_.

8.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, if such court declines to exercise
jurisdiction over such matter, any state or federal court in the State of
Delaware), and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court
therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or
proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed

 



-48-  to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties
agree that service of any court paper may be made in any manner as may be
provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing service of
process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

8.6 _Attorneys  Fees_. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this
Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party
in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit.

 

8.7 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof or are otherwise breached, and that the party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other
equitable relief. The parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of
any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) The right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief, in each case, shall be
subject to the requirement that:

 

(i) all of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived as of the
Expiration Time; and

 

(ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that (i) all
the Offer Conditions and the conditions in  _Section 6.1_, as applicable,
have been satisfied or waived by Parent, and (ii) if specific performance is
granted, the Offer Closing and the Closing would occur.

 

8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that
Purchaser may (i) assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent or (ii) pledge its rights
hereunder to any sources of third-party debt financing, each without the
consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



-49- 8.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed duly delivered: (i) four (4) Business Days after

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
to which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

1\. Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not be required to irrevocably accept for purchase or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Purchaser to purchase or return
tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), to
purchase any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer unless, immediately
prior to the then-applicable Expiration Time:

 

(a) any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the
HSR Act or under each applicable foreign antitrust or competition law shall
have expired or been terminated; and

(b) there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that
number of Shares (not counting and excluding Shares tendered in the Offer
pursuant to guaranteed delivery instructions for which certificates have not
yet been delivered) which, together with any Shares then owned, directly or
indirectly by Purchaser, Parent and any other Subsidiaries of Parent,
collectively represent as of the Expiration Time at least one (1) Share more
than fifty percent (50%) of the sum of (A) all Shares then outstanding; and
(B) all Shares that the Company may be required to issue upon the vesting
(including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer),
conversion, settlement, or exercise of all then outstanding options, warrants
or securities convertible or exchangeable into Shares, or other rights to
acquire or be issued Shares, regardless of the conversion or exercise price or
other terms and conditions thereof (the condition in this clause (b) being
referred to herein as the " _Minimum Condition_ ").

2\. Purchaser shall not be required to irrevocably accept for purchase or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Purchaser to
purchase or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer)), to purchase any Shares tendered in connection with
the Offer if, immediately prior to the then-applicable Expiration Time, any of
the following conditions exist:

 

(a) any Restraint or Law shall be enacted, enforced, promulgated, amended,
issued or deemed applicable to the Offer by any Governmental Body of
competent jurisdiction, that is in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the making or consummation of the
Offer or the Merger;

 

(b) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 3.3_ (Authority), and _Section 3.23_ (Brokers) of the Agreement
were not true and correct as of the Agreement Date or are not true and correct
as of the Expiration Time, as though made on and as of the Expiration

 



A-1  Time, and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Section 3.4(a) through (c)_ (Capitalization) were not true and correct as
of the Agreement Date or are not true and correct as of the Expiration Time,
as though made on and as of the Expiration Time, in the case of clause (ii),
other than de minimis inaccuracies, except that the accuracy of
representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of the Agreement
Date or some other date will be determined as of such date;

(c) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Agreement (other than those described in clause (b) above) were not true and
correct as of the Agreement Date or are not true and correct as of the
Expiration Time, as though made on and as of the Expiration Time, except (i)
that the accuracy of representations and warranties that by their terms speak
as of the Agreement Date or some other date will be determined as of such
date; and (ii) where the failure of such representations and
warranties, individually or the aggregate, to be true and correct (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect") has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect that has not
been cured prior to the Expiration Time;

(d) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations or covenants under the Agreement and such
failure to perform or comply with such obligations or covenants shall not have
been cured prior to the Expiration Time;

 

(e) after the Agreement Date, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have
occurred and be continuing; or

 

(f) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate, signed on behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer
or chief financial officer that none of the conditions set forth in clauses
(b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 2 above shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the Expiration Time.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Purchaser and Parent to extend, terminate or modify
the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser
and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by
Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time
prior to the Expiration Time in the sole discretion of Parent or
Purchaser. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time, subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC.
