 _STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 

 __

 

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of July 5, 2004 (this " _Agreement_ ") among
BHI INVESTMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "), BW
HOLDINGS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _BW_ "), BORDEN
HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Holdings_ "), BORDEN CHEMICAL,
INC., a New Jersey corporation (" _Borden_ "), CRAIG O. MORRISON and JOSEPH P.
BEVILAQUA (each of the last two individuals, an " _Individual Seller_ " and,
together with BW, the " _Sellers_ ").

 



 

 _W I T N E S S E T H_ :

 

WHEREAS, BW owns 2,000,000 shares of common stock (the " _Holdings Common
Stock_ "), par value $0.01 per share, of Borden Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Holdings_ "), representing 100% of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Holdings (the " _Holdings Shares_ "), and Holdings in turn
owns 198,974,994 shares of common stock of Borden, par value $0.01 per share
(the " _Borden Common Stock_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Individual Sellers collectively own 1,920,634 shares (including
1,587,301 restricted shares (the " _Individual Restricted Shares_ ")) of
Borden Common Stock (all such shares that are not Individual Restricted Shares
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Individual Seller Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, BDS Two, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Borden (" _BDS Two_ "), owns 858,970 shares of Borden Common Stock;

 



 

WHEREAS, Holdings, BDS Two and the Individual Sellers collectively own 100% of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Borden (the " _Borden Shares_ "
and, together with the Holdings Shares, the " _Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from BW, and BW desires to sell to Buyer,
the Holdings Shares pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from the Individual Sellers, and the
Individual Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, the Individual Seller Shares
pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms, conditions and other
agreements set forth herein and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 

 ****

 

 **THE STOCK PURCHASE**

 



 

1.1 _Aggregate Consideration_

 

. The aggregate amount to be paid or funded by Buyer pursuant to Sections 1.2,
1.3, 1.6, 3.10 and 6.2 is an amount equal to $1,150,500,000 less Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness plus Estimated Closing Date Cash (plus the amount,
if any, that the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net
Working Capital and minus the amount, if any, that the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital) (subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 1.4) and shall be allocated as set forth in such sections.

 



 

1.2 _Holdings Stock Purchase_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined below), BW shall sell
to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from BW, the Holdings Shares.


 

(b) In consideration for the sale and transfer of the Holdings Shares, and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing
Date (as defined below), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Paying
Agent by wire transfer in immediately available funds an aggregate amount
equal to the Borden Shares Purchase Price. The " _Borden Shares Purchase
Price_ " shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

 



 

 _STEP 1_ :

 

CSC = _PP + OPTPR_

 

 (CS + OPT)

 

where CS = Number of shares of Borden Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing

 

 CSC = Common Share Consideration

 

OPT = Number of Borden Shares covered by the In-the Money Stock Options (as
defined in Section 1.6) outstanding immediately prior to the Closing

 

OPTPR = Aggregate exercise price of all In-the-Money Stock Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing

 

PP = $1,150,500,000, less (1) the sum of (A) the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness (as defined below), (B) any amounts to be provided or arranged by
the Buyer pursuant to Section 3.10, (C) the Sellers Closing Expense Amount
(as defined in Section 6.2), (D) one-half of the Bonus Payment Amount and (E)
the amount, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital (as defined below) is
less than $109,200,000 (the " _Target Net Working Capital_ "), plus (2) the
amount, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target
Net Working Capital plus (3) the Estimated Closing Date Cash (as defined
below). 

 

 _STEP 2_ :

 

BSPP = (CSC x BCS)

 



 

 where BSPP = Borden Shares Purchase Price

 

CSC = Common Share Consideration determined in accordance with Step 1

 

BCS = Number of shares of Borden Common Stock owned by Holdings
immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

 No later than the close of business on the business day prior to the Closing Date, BW will provide to Buyer in writing its good faith estimate of (i) the number of outstanding Stock Options, (ii) the number of outstanding shares of Borden Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Borden Common Stock owned by Holdings, (iv) all Closing Date Indebtedness and (v) the Closing Date Cash. " _Closing Date Cash_ " means the amount of cash on hand on the Closing Date, at Holdings and its Subsidiaries, after application of the withholding taxes applicable to the repatriation of such cash _plus_ the DandO Insurance Amount (which amount of cash shall (i) be calculated before any payments of transaction costs and expenses of Holdings, Borden and the Sellers and (ii) shall exclude any Stock Option Settlement Amount or Bonus Payment Amount (as each is defined in Section 1.6) and any other payment in respect of any Stock Option to the extent such amounts are included in OPTPR (as defined above)). " _Closing Date Indebtedness_ " means all Indebtedness owed by Holdings or Borden or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to Holdings or any Subsidiaries of Holdings), outstanding on the Closing Date. The estimates of the Closing Date Indebtedness and the Closing Date Cash provided to Buyer pursuant to the foregoing sentence are referred to herein as the " _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ " and the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ ", respectively. 

 



 

(c) On the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, BW shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to Buyer
certificates representing the Holdings Shares duly endorsed, or accompanied by
stock powers duly executed, with all necessary stock transfer stamps attached
thereto and canceled.

 



 

1.3 _Borden Stock Purchase_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and an
Individual Seller, at the Closing, the Individual Sellers shall sell to Buyer,
and Buyer shall purchase from the Individual Sellers, the Individual Seller
Shares.

 



 

 (b) In consideration for the sale and transfer of the Individual Seller Shares, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Paying Agent by wire transfer in immediately available funds an aggregate amount equal to the product of the Common Share Consideration determined under Section 1.2(b) and the Individual Seller Shares. The amount to be paid to the Paying Agent in respect of the Borden Shares held by each Individual Seller is set forth on _Schedule 1.3_.

 



 

(c) On the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the Individual Sellers shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver
to Buyer certificates representing the Individual Seller Shares duly endorsed,
or accompanied by stock powers duly executed, with all necessary stock
transfer stamps attached thereto and canceled.

 



 

1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_

 

. (a) BW shall, at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, cause to
be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the " _Preliminary Statement_
") setting forth the estimated calculations of the Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") as of the close of business on the Closing
Date but immediately prior to the Closing. " _Net Working Capital_ " shall
mean the current assets less the current liabilities of Borden and its
Subsidiaries, all as determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and practices as applied on a consistent basis in the
preparation of the Financial Statements (as defined in Section 2.2(f));
provided that, in determining Net Working Capital, (i) there shall not be any
reevaluation of the reserves (with the "Current Portion of Restructuring
Reserve, Litigation and Legal Fee Reserve and Environmental Reserve" to be
$18.6 million less any cash expenditures related thereto from May 31, 2004
through the Closing) or write down of inventory from their respective levels
at December 31, 2003 (so long as since such date (x) there have been no
changes in accounting principles in effect and used to calculate such levels
or amounts and (y) no events have occurred that could materially impact these
amounts or levels), (ii) cash and Indebtedness (other than the portion of
Indebtedness described in clauses (b), (c) and (f) of the definition of
Indebtedness that is reflected as a current liability of Borden and its
Subsidiaries) shall be excluded, (iii) the liabilities with respect to Stock
Option Settlement Amount or Bonus Payment Amounts (as each is defined in
Section 1.6), any payment on or with respect to any Stock Option, included in
OPTPR and any cash received upon exercise of any Stock Options shall be
excluded, (iv) the transaction costs and expenses of Holdings, Borden and the
Sellers shall be excluded, (v) net deferred income tax assets/liabilities and
income taxes payable/receivable shall be excluded, (vi) any Affiliate
Indebtedness shall be excluded, (vii) non-operating Affiliate payables and
receivables (which includes management fees and directors fees) which are to
be satisfied or cancelled in accordance with Section 3.6 shall be excluded,
(viii) any amounts payable to, or received by, Holdings or its Subsidiaries in
connection with or as a result of (w) Delta-Ha Inc.s exercise of its option
to purchase Class B Interests from Borden Chemical Foundry, Inc. (x) the sale
of the assets and order book of Combined Composite Technologies Limited and
(y) the sale of the Pressure Sensitive business, all shall be excluded from
Net Working Capital and shall not be included as cash, and if received and
used by the Sellers to reduce Indebtedness prior to the Closing Date, then the
amount of such Indebtedness payment shall be disregarded for purposes of
calculating the amount of Closing Date Indebtedness, and (ix) any Tax benefits
related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees in connection with the
transaction shall be excluded.

 



 

Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to BW a statement (the " _Statement_ ") setting forth
(i) the Net Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness and (iii) the
Closing Date Cash and the detailed components and calculation of each of Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash, in each case
as of the time immediately prior to Closing on the Closing Date. At the same
time, Buyer shall also cause to be prepared and delivered to BW a statement
(the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the calculations of (A) the
amount of the Net Working Capital as shown on the Statement minus the
Estimated Net Working Capital, (B) the amount of the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness minus the Closing Date Indebtedness as shown on the Statement,
(C) the amount of the Closing Date Cash as shown on the Statement minus the
Estimated Closing Date Cash and (D) the Holdings Amount (if any). " _Holdings
Amount"_ shall mean the amount of Unrecorded Holdings Assets minus Unrecorded
Holdings Liabilities; provided, that if such difference is less than $2
million, if positive, or less than negative $2 million, if negative, the
Holdings Amount shall be deemed to be zero. " _Unrecorded Holdings
Liabilities_ " means liabilities recorded on the balance sheet included in the
audited financial statements of Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2003,
(other than (i) liabilities recorded or adjusted as a result of adjustments
arising from the application of purchase accounting (with respect to Borden
and the pension liability payable from Borden Capital to BCI) to the audited
financial statements of Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2003, (ii)
liabilities to the extent not reflecting an obligation by Holdings to make a
cash payment and (iii) liabilities reflected on the balance sheet included in
the Borden Audited Financial Statements or described in the notes thereto)
that are not (a) reflected on the draft unaudited consolidating balance sheet
of Holdings as of December 31, 2003 or (b) described in the notes to the
Holdings Financial Statements. " _Unrecorded Holdings Assets_ " means assets
recorded on the balance sheet included in the audited financial statements of
Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2003 (other than (i) assets recorded
or adjusted as a result of adjustments arising from the application of
purchase accounting (with respect to Borden and the pension liability payable
from Borden Capital to BCI) to the audited financial statements of Holdings
for the year ended December 31, 2003, (ii) intangible assets, and (iii) assets
reflected on the balance sheet included in the Borden Audited Financial
Statements or described in the notes thereto) that are not (a) reflected on
the draft unaudited consolidating balance sheet of Holdings as of December 31,
2003 or (b) described in the notes to the Holdings Financial Statements. The
sum of the amounts referred to in (A), (B) and (C) above, which might be a
negative number, is referred to hereinafter as the " _Adjustment Amount_ ".
If, at any time prior to the final resolution of all disputed items on the
Statement or the Adjustment Statement, additional information shall become
known to BW or Buyer that would change the amount of the Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Indebtedness or Closing Date Cash shown on the Statement or the
calculation thereof, then BW or Buyer shall have the right to amend the
Statement and Adjustment Statement to reflect such additional information. BW
or Buyer shall promptly notify Buyer or BW if it shall become aware of any
such additional information prior to the end of the Resolution Period.


 

(b) After receipt of the Statement and the Adjustment Statement, BW will
have 30 calendar days to review the Statement and the Adjustment Statement
together with the workpapers used in their preparation. Buyer shall provide BW
with access to the relevant books and records, workpapers and employees of
Borden and its Subsidiaries reasonably required by BW and its advisors,
accountants and agents to conduct such review. Unless BW delivers to Buyer
written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the specific items disputed
by BW and a written statement setting forth BWs calculation of each line item
shown on the Statement so disputed and the amount in dispute (" _BW s
Statement_") on or prior to the thirtieth day after its receipt of the
Statement and the Adjustment Statement, BW will be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Statement and the Adjustment Statement and such agreement will
be final and binding. Any items on the Statement or Adjustment Statement as to
which BW has not given notice of its objection and provided an alternative
calculation on BWs Statement will be deemed to have been agreed upon by the
parties, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 1.4(b). If BW so
notifies Buyer of its objections to any of the Statement or the Adjustment
Statement and provides Buyer with the BWs Statement, Buyer and BW will,
within 30 days following the notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to
resolve their differences. Any resolution by Buyer and BW during the
Resolution Period as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and
conclusive.

 



 

If Buyer and BW do not resolve all disputed items by the end of the Resolution
Period, then all items remaining in dispute will be submitted within 30 days
after the expiration of the Resolution Period to a "big four" or such other
national independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and BW (the
" _Neutral Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall
act as an arbitrator to determine only those items in dispute. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and
BW, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the
disputed items so submitted to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted. The Neutral Accounting Arbitrator will deliver to Buyer and BW a
written determination (such determination to include a work sheet setting
forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to
be based solely on information provided to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator
by BW and Buyer) of the disputed items within 30 days of receipt of the
disputed items, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive. The
final, binding and conclusive Statement and Adjustment Statement, which either
are agreed upon by Buyer and BW or are delivered by the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator in accordance with this Section 1.4, will be the " _Conclusive
Statement_ " and the " _Conclusive Adjustment Statement_ ", respectively. In
the event that either Buyer or BW fails to submit its statement regarding any
items remaining in dispute within the time determined by the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator, then the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall render a
decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted to the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator by Buyer and BW.

 



 

(c) If the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Conclusive Adjustment Statement
is a negative number, then the Borden Shares Purchase Price will be reduced by
such amount, and BW shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to such
Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Conclusive
Adjustment Statement is a positive number, then the Borden Shares Purchase
Price will be increased by such amount, and Buyer shall pay to BW an amount in
cash equal to such Adjustment Amount. If the Holdings Amount as shown on the
Conclusive Adjustment Statement is a negative number, then the Borden Shares
Purchase Price will be reduced by such amount, and BW shall pay to Buyer an
amount in cash equal to such Holdings Amount. If the Holdings Amount as shown
on the Conclusive Adjustment Statement is a positive number, then the Borden
Shares Purchase Price will be increased by such amount, and Buyer shall pay to
BW an amount in cash equal to such Holdings Amount; provided, that such
adjustment may be paid by delivery by Buyer to BW of the assets that resulted
in the increase in Unrecorded Holdings Assets. All payments to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.4(d) will be made on the second business day
following the date on which Buyer and BW agree to, or the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive Statement and the Conclusive Adjustment
Statement. Any payment required to be made by BW or Buyer pursuant to this
Section 1.4(d) shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the date of
payment at a rate of interest equal to the prime rate per annum publicly
announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A. at its principal office in New
York City, and shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by the party entitled to receive
such funds prior to the date when such payment is due.

 



 

1.5 _Closing_

 

. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions herein
contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 6.1, and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article IV, the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the later of (a) the date
that is 45 days from the date of this Agreement and (b) second business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in
Article IV hereof (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of OMelveny and
Myers LLP, Seven Times Square, New York, New York, unless another date, time
or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

1.6 _Treatment of Stock Options; Payment of Bonus Amounts_

 

. (a) Unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and a holder of an option to purchase
Borden Shares (each, a " _Stock Option_ "), one day after the Closing each
holder of a Stock Option granted under the 1996 Stock Purchase and Option Plan
for Key Employees of Borden and its Subsidiaries, as amended (the " _Option
Plan_ ") will be entitled (whether such Stock Options are immediately
exercisable or not), to receive from Borden in settlement thereof a cash
payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Common Share
Consideration (as determined pursuant to Section 1.2(b)) over the applicable
exercise price per Borden Share for each such Stock Option, multiplied by the
number of Borden Shares covered by such Stock Option (any such amounts to be
paid, together with the amounts that would have been paid under the Stock
Options that are cancelled pursuant to an agreement among the Buyer and the
holders of such Stock Options, collectively, the " _Stock Option Settlement
Amount_ "), net of any applicable withholding taxes. No later than the close
of business on the business day prior to the Closing Date, Holdings shall
deliver to Buyer a true and complete list setting forth the name of each
holder of a Stock Option and the Stock Option Settlement Amount with respect
to each such holder. All Stock Options set forth on such list and for which a
Stock Option Settlement Amount is to be paid shall be referred to herein as
"In-The-Money Stock Options". Unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and a holder of
a Stock Option, all Stock Options (including the Stock Options for which the
applicable exercise price per Borden Share exceeds the Common Stock
Consideration) shall be canceled upon the payment of the Stock Option
Settlement Amount, if any. Borden shall provide prior to closing, evidence of
the cancellation of each Stock Option for which the applicable exercise price
per Borden Share exceeds the Common Share Consideration.

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed, on the day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
pay, or otherwise provide, to Holdings, an amount equal to one-half of the
aggregate Bonus Payment Amounts (as defined below). Unless otherwise agreed,
on the day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) cause Holdings to pay each
employee the amount set forth opposite such employee\'s name on Schedule
1.6(b) under the heading "Cash Bonus Payment," (ii) adopt a deferred stock
plan with the terms as set forth in the plan adopted pursuant to Section 3.16,
without duplication of the amounts set forth in such plan, and (iii) cause
each employee to be allocated a number of shares in such deferred stock plan
equal to the quotient of the amount set forth opposite such employee\'s name
on Schedule 1.6(b) under the heading "Deferred Stock Account Value" divided by
the Common Share Consideration and (iv) make any such payments and deferred
stock account allocations to Craig Morrison as are set forth in that certain
letter to Craig Morrison from Buyer dated July 5, 2004. Schedule 1.6(b) shall
be delivered in good faith by Holdings to Buyer at least two days prior to the
Closing Date. " _Bonus Payment Amount_ " means the aggregate amount of all
bonus payments required to be made by Holdings or its Subsidiaries to any
current or former employee, whether pursuant to an employment agreement,
employee or executive incentive or bonus arrangement or otherwise, as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
which have not been paid prior to the Closing Date and shall include any bonus
and the value of the deferred compensation provided for under the bonus and
deferred compensation plan described in Schedules 1.6(b) and 1.6(b)(i).

Section 3.4(b) is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction to its
fullest extent, BW agrees that a court of competent jurisdiction may enforce
such restriction to the maximum extent permitted by Law, and BW hereby
consents and agrees that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in
any proceeding brought to enforce such restriction. For purposes of this
Section 3.4(b), Affiliates of BW shall only include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and
Co ("KKR") and any entity who controls KKR.

 



 

3.5 _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by Law, prior to the

required by Law with respect to the execution and delivery of or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and BW shall consult with
each other and each party shall have reasonable opportunity to comment on such
press release and prior to issuing a press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Closing, Buyer and BW shall agree on the form
of such press release or other public announcement.

 



 

3.6 _Termination of Affiliate Relations_. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, on or prior to the Closing Date, (a) Holdings and Borden shall have
repaid or otherwise settled all of its outstanding indebtedness (including any
interest thereon) and satisfied all of their other liabilities, but excluding
payables for goods sold and services rendered which shall be paid in the
ordinary course of the business, owed to BW or its Affiliates (other than
Holdings and its Subsidiaries), including without limitation, management fees,
and director fees; provided that Buyer shall have provided Holdings and Borden
with all funds necessary therefor pursuant to Section 3.10; and (b) BW and its
Affiliates (other than Holdings and its Subsidiaries) shall have repaid or
otherwise settled all of their outstanding Indebtedness and satisfied all of
their other liabilities (other than payables for goods sold and services

or otherwise settled pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence
that are not so repaid or otherwise settled on or prior to the Closing Date
shall be deemed cancelled as of the Closing Date and the obligations set forth
in clauses (a) and (b) above shall be deemed to have been satisfied. All
agreements between Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and BW and
its Affiliates, on the other hand (other than agreements solely between
Holdings and its Subsidiaries, agreements contemplated by this Agreement and
agreements listed on _Schedule 3.6_ ), shall be terminated as of the Closing,
and all obligations and liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied in
full, with no continuing obligations under any such agreement. Unless
otherwise requested by Buyer, Indebtedness among Holdings and its Subsidiaries

3.7 _Further Actions_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its
reasonable best efforts: (i) to obtain, in addition to approvals and consents
discussed in Section 3.3 hereof, any licenses, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of federal, state, local and foreign
Governmental Authorities as are required in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) to effect, in addition to
filings discussed in Section 3.3 hereof, all necessary registrations and
filings; (iii) to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, whether brought derivatively or on behalf of third
parties (including Governmental Authorities or officials), challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(iv) to furnish to each other such information and assistance and to consult
with respect to the terms of any registration, filing, application or
undertaking as reasonably may be requested in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Buyer agrees that the obtaining of required consents and approvals of
parties to contracts with Holdings and its Subsidiaries is primarily the
responsibility of Buyer and that Buyer shall use its best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain any consents and approvals of parties
to contracts with Borden or any of its Subsidiaries as are required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The parties agree that, prior to the Closing, they will review
arrangements proposed by the Buyer among the Buyer, BW, Holdings, Borden or
any of their Affiliates that will achieve beneficial Tax results and financing
arrangements for the Buyer without resulting in any adverse consequences for
BW or any of its Affiliates, and, at the sole discretion of BW, will cooperate
to implement or continue any such arrangements identified and agreed upon.

 



 

3.8 _Insurance_. (a) Effective on and after the Closing Date, BW shall have
no obligation to provide insurance coverage for Holdings and its Subsidiaries
for occurrences after the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, any third
party administrators who administer claims prior to the Closing Date shall
continue to administer for the benefit of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, as to
occurrences prior to the Closing Date, all such insurance programs in
accordance with the terms and conditions in effect on the date hereof.
Holdings will be liable for and will pay all additional associated costs that
are charged by ESIS or such other third party administrator with respect to
administrative activities related to the rights of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall use its best efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date
and effective on and as of the Closing Date, replacement surety bonds
(including letters of credit collateralizing any such surety bonds, if
necessary) with respect to the surety bonds set forth on _Schedule 3.8_. At
Closing, to the extent Buyer is unable to obtain any such replacement surety
bonds or letters of credit, Buyer shall provide BW with a letter of credit
issued by a commercial bank domiciled in the United States of America with
capital exceeding $500,000,000. The letter of credit shall be for the benefit
of BW and shall be in an initial amount equal to the amount of any surety
bonds or letters of credit set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ that have not been
replaced at Closing. Thereafter, the amount of the letter of credit shall be
equal to the dollar amount determined by multiplying the Sharing Percentage
(as determined below) by the total amount of the bonds and letters of credit
set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ that are outstanding. The " _Sharing Percentage_ "
shall be determined by BW in good faith and consistent with past practice by
taking the total amount of the obligations of BW secured by the surety bonds
and letters of credit set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ that have not been replaced
at Closing and that are outstanding and that relate to the collateral
requirements of Holdings and its Subsidiaries divided by the total amount of
the obligations secured by such surety bonds and letters of credit. The
Sharing Percentages shall be calculated by BW on an annual basis and shall be
subject to Buyers reasonable review and approval.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause Holdings and its Subsidiaries to, reimburse
BW for a portion of the costs and expenses associated with maintaining the
surety bonds and letters of credit set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ that remain
outstanding after the Closing equal to the Sharing Percentage multiplied by
the total cost of maintaining such surety bonds and letters of credit.

 



 

(d) Subject to the provisions contained in this Section 3.8, in the event
that a BW letter of credit on behalf of Holdings and its Subsidiaries is drawn
upon, Buyer shall reimburse BW for all amounts so drawn regardless of whether
or not such amount exceeds the then outstanding balance amount of Buyers
letter of credit and regardless of whether or not Buyer has entered into any
buy-out arrangement.

 

 ****

 

(e) _Schedule 3.8(e)_ contains an accurate and complete list of all letters
of credit or surety bonds issued by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to their or any third parties insurance-related obligations. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(e)_, no letter of credit or surety bond issued
by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, relating to their or any third parties
insurance related obligations, have been drawn upon.

 



 

3.9 _Directors and Officers_. At the Closing, BW shall cause to be
delivered to Buyer duly signed resignations of the directors and officers of
each of Holdings and Borden (other than those directors and officers listed on
_Schedule 3.9_ ), effective upon the Closing.

 



 

 3.10 _Certain Payments_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide or arrange to provide Holdings and Borden with amounts of cash equal
to the amounts of cash needed for Holdings, Borden and their Subsidiaries to
repay or otherwise settle all of their outstanding indebtedness (including
interest thereon) and satisfy all of their other liabilities (other than
payables for goods sold and services rendered which shall be paid in the
ordinary course, including, without limitation, management fees and directors
fees) owed to BW and its Affiliates (other than Holdings and its
Subsidiaries). Such Indebtedness and other liabilities collectively referred
to herein as the " _Affiliate Indebtedness_ ".

 



 

 3.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. Except as required by
Law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent governing
instruments) of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent governing documents)
of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after
the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at or prior to the Closing Date were directors,
officers, agents or employees of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or who
were otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent governing instruments) of Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer will indemnify each individual who served as a
director or officer of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior
to the Closing Date from and against all actions, suits, proceedings,
hearings, investigations, claims, etc. including all court costs and
reasonable attorney fees and expenses resulting from or arising out of, or
caused by, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Prior to the Closing, BW, Holdings or Borden may purchase or agree to purchase
as of the Closing a tail policy to the current policy of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, which tail
policy may be effective for a period from the Closing through and including
the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date, and which tail
policy may contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage
currently provided by such current policy. The amount actually paid for the
entire tail policy, up to a maximum of $3,200,000, shall be referred to herein
as the " _D andO Insurance Amount_".

 



 

 3.12 _Release of Guarantees_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees to provide substitute guarantees to replace the guarantees set forth on
_Schedule 3.12_ (the " _Guarantees_ ") in form and substance satisfactory to
the respective banks or other counterparties, and Buyer agrees to obtain a
release in form and substance satisfactory to BW from all the Guarantees.

 



 

 3.13 _Financing_. (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to (x) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments and to satisfy the conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth
therein (including, without limitation, by funding the equity contemplated by
the Equity Financing Commitment), (y) enter into definitive financing
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Debt Financing
Agreement_ ") so that the Debt Financing Agreement is in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date and (z) consummate

facility contemplated by the Financing Commitments to cause the Closing to
occur as soon as practicable but in any event no later than the date occurring
45 days after the date hereof (subject to the satisfaction or waivers of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement). Buyer shall provide to BW copies of
all material legal documents and offering memoranda relating to the Financing
and shall keep BW reasonably informed of the status of the financing process
relating thereto. BW shall cause Holdings and its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers and employees to provide such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing, including
in connection with the preparation of "bank books", offering materials and
similar documents and all other necessary cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any financing to be consummated contemporaneous with or at or
after the Closing in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including without limitation, participation in good faith in
meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering
memoranda and the execution and delivery of underwriting, placement or similar
agreements, whose effectiveness shall be conditioned on the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Holdings and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this paragraph
and in connection with any other Debt Financing matters shall be borne by
Buyer and shall be paid by Buyer to the party incurring such costs and
expenses at least one business day prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Buyer to
satisfy its obligations under Section 3.13(a), any of the Financing
Commitments or the Debt Financing Agreement expire or are terminated prior to
the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, Buyer shall (i) promptly
notify BW of such expiration or termination and the reasons therefor and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts (subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 3.13(a) above) promptly to arrange for alternative financing to
replace the financing contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments
or agreements, sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

 3.14 _No Shop_. Until the earlier of the Closing and the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to its terms, BW shall not, and shall use its best
efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and each of its affiliates
directors, officers, employees and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, other than with Buyer, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly

otherwise) with respect to (i) the acquisition of any shares of capital stock

therein, (ii) the acquisition of all or a material portion of the assets and
properties of Holdings, its Subsidiaries or interests therein or (iii) the
