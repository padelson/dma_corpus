Adjusted Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the sum of the total amount of estimated

(c) In addition, if Closing occurs after October 31, 2009, the Purchase Price
payable at Closing pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be decreased by an amount
equal to $1,550,000 multiplied by the number of days from but excluding
October 31, 2009 through and including the Closing Date (such amount, the "
_Estimated Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow_ ").

SECTION 2.06. _Closing Statement; Determination of Final Closing Adjusted
Working Capital and Final Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow_. (a) As promptly
as practicable, but no later than 45 days, after the Closing Date, PandG will
cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth (i) each line item included in the calculation of
Closing Adjusted Working Capital as set forth in the Adjusted Working Capital
Schedule and PandGs calculation of Closing Adjusted Working Capital and (ii) to
the extent  



 

18  Closing occurs after October 31, 2009, each line item included in the
calculation of Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow as set forth in the Net Cash
Flow Schedule, and a certificate based on such Closing Statement setting
forth PandGs calculations of Closing Adjusted Working Capital and, if
applicable, Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow. PandG and Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that (A) Closing Adjusted Working Capital shall be determined in the
same manner as and using the same basis and account classifications and in
accordance with accounting policies and practices consistent with those used
in the illustrative calculation set forth in the Adjusted Working Capital
Schedule but in all cases in accordance with GAAP; and (B) Adjustment Period
Net Cash Flow shall be determined in accordance with accounting policies and
practices consistent with those used in the preparation of the Net Cash Flow
Schedule. Following the delivery of the Closing Statement, PandG shall permit
Purchaser and its representatives to review copies of workpapers of PandG, and
other documents reasonably requested by Purchaser, relating to the Closing
Statement and the adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.07.

(b) If Purchaser disagrees with PandGs calculations of Closing Adjusted
Working Capital or (if applicable) Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow delivered
pursuant to Section 2.06(a), Purchaser may, within 20 days after delivery of
the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to PandG disagreeing with such
calculations, which shall specify Purchasers calculations of Closing Adjusted
Working Capital (and if applicable) Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow in
reasonable detail and with reasonable specificity, and Purchasers grounds
for such disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ").

(c) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.06(b), PandG and Purchaser shall, during the 30 days following such delivery,
use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing
Adjusted Working Capital (which amount shall not be more than the amount
thereof shown in PandGs calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.06(a) nor
less than the amount thereof shown in Purchasers calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 2.06(b)) or Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow (which amount
shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in PandGs calculations
delivered pursuant to Section 2.06(a) nor more than the amount thereof shown
in Purchasers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.06(b)). If PandG and
Purchaser are able to resolve all or a portion of such disputed items within
such 30-day period, they shall reduce such resolution to writing and the
matters so agreed upon shall be final and binding on PandG and Purchaser. If PandG
and Purchaser are unable to resolve all such disputed items during such
period, they shall promptly thereafter submit the matters remaining in
dispute to a nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon
by Purchaser and PandG (the " _Accounting Referee_ ")), for the purpose of
calculating Closing Adjusted Working Capital or Adjustment Period Net Cash
Flow, as applicable. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement or PandGs
calculation of Closing Adjusted Working Capital or Adjustment Period Net Cash
Flow, as applicable, as to which there were unresolved disputes. The parties
shall instruct the Accounting Referee to promptly to review this Agreement and
the disputed items or amounts and to render its reasoned written decision as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30 days after its
selection. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to PandG and Purchaser, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be final and binding upon PandG and Purchaser and shall constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.  



 

19  The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by PandG and
Purchaser. After the final determination of Closing Adjusted Working Capital,
and Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow, Purchaser shall have no further right to
make any claims against PandG in respect of any element of Closing Adjusted
Working Capital or Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow (i) to the extent it was
included in Final Closing Adjusted Working Capital as a specific liability or
reserve, (ii) to the extent it would result in a duplicative payment to
Purchaser of amounts recovered as a purchase price adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.07 or (iii) to the extent that Purchaser raised an objection to
such item in the Notice of Objection.

(d) PandG and Purchaser agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the calculations of Closing Adjusted Working
Capital and Adjustment Period Net Cash Flow, including making available to
the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

SECTION 2.07. _Post-Closing Adjustments to Purchase Price_. (a) If:

(i) Final Closing Adjusted Working Capital is greater than Estimated Closing
Adjusted Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to PandG the amount of such
excess; and

(ii) Final Closing Adjusted Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing
Adjusted Working Capital, PandG shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such
shortfall.

(b) In addition, if Closing occurs after October 31, 2009 and:

threatened in writing, against PandG or any of its Affiliates (i) claiming that
any Transferred Subsidiary or the conduct of the Pharmaceuticals Business has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property in
relation to any material activity of the  



 

27  Pharmaceuticals Business; (ii) in connection with any Contract pursuant to
which PandG or any of its Affiliates receive or grant any right to use
or covenant not to sue under any Intellectual Property material to the
Pharmaceuticals Business or included in the Pharmaceuticals Business
Intellectual Property or (iii) otherwise in connection with any Intellectual
Property which would, in the case of (iii), reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Pharmaceuticals Business.
To the Knowledge of PandG, no Person has infringed any material Pharmaceuticals
Business Intellectual Property. None of PandG or its Affiliates has made any
written claim or commenced any Proceeding claiming that any Person has
infringed or misappropriated any of the material Pharmaceuticals Business
Intellectual Property.

(d) PandG and its Affiliates (i) are the sole and exclusive owners of all
Registered Intellectual Property and all other Pharmaceuticals
Business Intellectual Property to the extent owned by PandG and its Affiliates

construed as a representation or warranty that the Transferred Subsidiaries or
the conduct of the Pharmaceuticals Business has not infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property of any third party, such
matters being the subject of Section 3.10(c)). There exist no material
restrictions on the disclosure use, license or transfer of the Pharmaceuticals
Business Intellectual Property. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will not
impair or extinguish any material Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual
Property or material Intellectual Property used by the Pharmaceuticals
Business under license from third parties (the " _Licensed Pharmaceuticals
Business Intellectual Property_ "). None of the material Pharmaceuticals
Business Intellectual Property and, to the Knowledge of PandG, none of the
material Licensed Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual Property to which PandG
or any of its Affiliates has exclusive rights (together with the material
Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual Property, the " _Material
Exclusive Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual Property_ ") has been
adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole or part, by any court of competent
jurisdiction and, to the Knowledge of PandG, all such Material Exclusive
Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable. All
maintenance and renewal fees necessary to preserve the material rights of PandG
and its Affiliates in connection with the Pharmaceuticals Business
Intellectual Property have been paid. 

(e) Each of the material patents and material patent applications included in
the Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual Property has been prosecuted in
compliance with all applicable rules, policies and procedures of the United

other jurisdiction in which such material patent or material patent
application is registered.

(f) Each of PandG and its Affiliates has taken reasonable steps in accordance
with normal industry practice to maintain the confidentiality of all material
Pharmaceuticals Business Intellectual Property, the value of which is
contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof, and no such
Intellectual Property has been disclosed to third parties who are not bound
by a duty of confidentiality in favor of PandG and/or its Affiliates.

39 SECTION 4.03. _Non-Contravention and Approvals_. (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement does not, the execution and
delivery by Purchaser of each Transaction Document to which it is or will be a

third partys) participation in the transactions contemplated hereby and by

Purchaser MAE.

SECTION 4.04. _Proceedings_. There are not any (a) outstanding Judgments
against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (b) Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of
its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be

SECTION 4.05.  _Financing_. (a) Purchaser has or, at Closing will have, funds
available sufficient to enable it to consummate the Acquisition and any
obligations of Purchaser in connection with a Sanofi Put.

(b) Purchaser has delivered to PandG a true and complete fully executed copy of
the commitment letter, dated as of August 24, 2009 between Purchaser and Bank
of America, N.A., Banc of America Bridge LLC, Banc of America Securities LLC,
Credit Suisse, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc, Barclays Bank
PLC, Barclays Capital, the investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC
and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and certain of their respective affiliates,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Commitment Letter_ "),
pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof each of the
parties thereto (other than Purchaser) have severally agreed to  



 

40  lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of such funds as set forth
therein, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Commitment
Letter. The Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise
modified or waived prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto.
There are no conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, assuming the
accuracy of PandGs representations and warranties contained in Section 3.07,
the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together with other
financial resources of Purchaser including cash on hand of Purchaser on the
Closing Date (such net proceeds, together with such other financial resources,
in the aggregate, the " _Funding Sources_ "), will, in the aggregate,
be sufficient for the satisfaction of (i) all of Purchasers obligations
under Section 2.04, (ii) any obligations of Purchaser in connection with a
Sanofi Put (other than any amount to be funded by PandG pursuant to
the Collaboration Matters Agreement (such amount, the " _P andG Funding
Amount_")), and (iii) the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably expected
to be incurred in connection herewith. As of the date of this Agreement, (i)
(assuming the accuracy of PandGs representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.07 hereof) no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Purchaser under the
Commitment Letter and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 and PandGs compliance with its obligations
under this Agreement, Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that any
of the conditions precedent to the Financing will not be satisfied (
_provided_ that Purchaser makes no representation regarding the satisfaction
of conditions to the extent relating to PandG and its Affiliates or the
Pharmaceuticals Business). Purchaser has fully paid any commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to
the Commitment Letter.

(c) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and at the time of the
satisfaction of the Sanofi Put if exercised), Purchaser and its consolidated
subsidiaries taken as a whole will not (i) be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair
value of its assets or because the present fair salable value of its assets
will be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its
debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii) have unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in its business, including the Pharmaceuticals
Business, or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to
repay such debts as they become absolute and matured.

SECTION 4.06. _Securities Laws_. The shares of capital stock of the
Transferred Subsidiaries are being acquired by Purchaser for
investment purposes only and not with a view to any public distribution
thereof. Purchaser has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiaries and is
capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.



 

41 SECTION 4.07. _Brokers and Finders_. There is no investment banker, broker,
finder, financial advisor or other intermediary who has been retained by or
is authorized to act on behalf of Purchaser that might be entitled to any fee
or commission in connection with the Acquisition other than those that are
party to the Commitment Letter, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by
Purchaser.

43 SECTION 5.02. _Financial Statements_. As soon as reasonably practicable and
using reasonable best efforts to deliver by September 1, 2009, PandG shall

provide Purchaser unaudited combined income statements for the six months
ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, upon which statements

in which the Closing Date occurs, such financial information for the
Pharmaceuticals Business for the portion of such fiscal quarter ending on the
Closing Date that is required by the Purchaser to establish an opening
balance sheet for the Pharmaceuticals Business as of the close of Business on
the Closing Date or for purposes of preparing pro forma financial statements
(which financial information need not be reviewed as set forth above).

SECTION 5.03. _Access to Information; Cooperation_. (a) Subject to
applicable Antitrust Laws, from the date hereof to the Closing Date, PandG
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) give Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice during normal
business hours, to the properties, books and records to the extent relating
to the Pharmaceuticals Business (other than the Excluded Assets); (ii) furnish
to Purchaser and its Representatives such financial and operating data and
other information relating to the Pharmaceuticals Business as such Persons
may reasonably request and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
assistance of PandGs employees, counsel, accountants and financial advisors in
connection with PandGs cooperation with Purchasers investigation of the

information requests and other cooperation do not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of PandG or its affiliates or the Pharmaceuticals Business).
Nothing contained in this Section 5.03(a) shall obligate PandG or its Affiliates
to breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any person whether such duty
arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise, or to waive any attorney-
client privilege. Except as provided in the second sentence of Section 5.21,
no investigation by Purchaser or other information received by Purchaser
pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall operate as a waiver or otherwise

attorney-client privilege.

(b) Subject to applicable Antitrust Laws, after the Closing Date, each of the
parties shall grant to the other such access to employees, financial records
and other information in their possession related to their conduct of the
Pharmaceuticals Business and such cooperation and assistance as shall be
reasonably required to enable each of them to complete their legal,
regulatory, stock exchange and financial reporting requirements and for any
other reasonable business purpose, including in respect of litigation and
insurance matters, other than with respect to litigation or other disputes
between the parties hereto. Each party shall promptly reimburse the other for
such other partys reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with requests
made by such first party under this Section 5.03(b), but no other charges
shall be payable by the requesting party to the other party in connection with
such requests. PandG shall provide any consent or waiver reasonably required in
order to permit Purchaser to engage the same counsel to represent Purchaser
following the Closing in connection with Pharmaceuticals Business matters on
which such counsel had represented PandG and its Affiliates prior to the
Closing.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) certain records may contain
information relating to PandG and its Affiliates other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries, or their respective divisions or businesses other than the
Pharmaceuticals Business and that PandG may retain copies thereof and (ii) prior
to making any records available to Purchaser, PandG may redact any portions
thereof that relate to PandG and its Affiliates other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries, or their respective divisions or businesses other than the
Pharmaceuticals Business.

SECTION 5.04. _Efforts; Antitrust Notifications_. (a) On the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement (including the provisions of Section 5.06
with respect to PandGs obligations to obtain any required Authorizations or
consents of third parties), PandG, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions and to do or cause to be done all things necessary or
appropriate to satisfy the conditions to the Closing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing.

(b) PandG, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, file or cause to be filed with
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United
States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") any notification and report
forms required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act. PandG, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall, as
promptly as practicable, make such other filings as are necessary in other
jurisdictions in order to comply with all applicable Antitrust Laws, and shall
promptly provide any supplemental information requested by applicable
Governmental Entities relating thereto. Any such filing, notification and
report form and supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act or such other applicable Antitrust Law.
PandG, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary  



 

45  under the HSR Act or such other applicable Antitrust Law. PandG, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall keep each other apprised of
the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable
Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request
and shall promptly provide any supplemental information requested in
connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act or such
other applicable Antitrust Law. Any such supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or such other
applicable Antitrust Law. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act or such other applicable
Antitrust Law for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.05. _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate and obtain
the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter,
including to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions (including
the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Commitment Letter and execute and
deliver to PandG a copy thereof substantially concurrently with such execution,
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser in the
Commitment Letter that are within its control and comply with its obligations
thereunder, and (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter in the
event of a breach by the financing sources that impedes or delays Closing,
including seeking specific performance of the parties thereunder. In the event
that all conditions to the Commitment Letter have been satisfied, or upon
funding will be satisfied, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund on
the Closing Date the Financing (together with funds from other Funding
Sources) required to consummate the Acquisition, and to fund, when
applicable, any portion of the Financing required to satisfy any obligations
of Purchaser in connection with a Sanofi Put (other than the PandG Funding
Amount) (in each case, including by Purchaser taking enforcement action,
including seeking specific performance, to cause such lenders and the other
Persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing). Purchaser shall have
the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter and/or
substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources, _provided_ that
any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that amends the Financing
and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Financing shall not (A)
expand upon or amend in any way that is adverse to PandG the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment
Letter or (B) be reasonably expected to prevent or impede or delay the
consummation of the Acquisition. Purchaser shall be permitted to reduce the
amount of Financing under the Commitment Letter in its reasonable discretion,
_provided_ , that Purchaser shall not reduce the Financing to an amount
committed below the amount that is required, together with other Funding
Sources, to satisfy (1) Purchasers obligations under Section 2.04, (2) any
obligations of Purchaser in connection with a Sanofi Put (other than the PandG
Funding Amount), and (3) the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably
expected to be incurred in connection herewith, and provided, further, that
such reduction shall not (A) expand upon or amend in any way that is adverse
to PandG the conditions precedent or contingencies to the Financing as set
forth in the Commitment Letter or (B) be reasonably expected to prevent or  



 

46  impede or delay the consummation of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable or Purchaser becomes aware of any event or circumstance
that makes any portion of the Financing unavailable, in each case, on the
terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and such portion is reasonably required to satisfy (1) the
Purchasers obligations under Section 2.04, (2) any obligations of the
Purchaser in connection with the Sanofi Put (other than the PandG Funding
Amount), and (3) the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to
be incurred in connection herewith, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative financing
sources in an amount sufficient (together with other Funding Sources) to
satisfy (1) the Purchasers obligations under Section 2.04, (2) any
obligations of the Purchaser in connection with the Sanofi Put (other than the
PandG Funding Amount), and (3) the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably
expected to be incurred in connection herewith upon conditions no less
favorable than those in the Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Purchaser shall give PandG prompt oral
and written notice (but in any event not later than 48 hours after the
Purchaser becoming aware of occurrence) of any material breach by any party to
the Commitment Letter or of any condition not likely to be satisfied, in
each case, of which Purchaser becomes aware or any termination of the
Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall keep PandG informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.

(b) PandG shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their
respective representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting,
to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with the Financing or any alternate debt or equity financing in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Financing Arrangements_ "),
including (i) providing information relating to the Pharmaceuticals Business
to the lenders and other financial institutions and investors that are or may
become parties to the Financing Arrangements and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Financing Arrangements
(the " _Financing Parties_ ") (including information to be used in the
preparation of an information package regarding the business, operations,
financial projections and prospects of Purchaser and the Pharmaceuticals
Business customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Financing by the Financing Parties) to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist in preparation of customary
offering or information documents to be used for the completion of the
Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter and in advance of the
Marketing Period, (ii) prior to and during the Marketing Period,

expertise, of the Pharmaceuticals Business), presentations, road shows,
drafting sessions, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence
sessions) and sessions with the rating agencies, (iii) in advance of the
Marketing Period, assisting in the preparation of (A) any customary offering
documents, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
(including historical and pro forma financial statements and information

and regulations under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), for any of the Financing, and (B) materials for rating
agency presentations, (iv) cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of
the Financing, (v) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts
to obtain from its advisors), and causing its Affiliates to execute
and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to  



 

47  obtain from their advisors), customary certificates, accounting comfort
letters (including consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Financing and in connection with any filings
required to be made by Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, where the Audited Financial
Statements are included or incorporated by reference), or other documents and
instruments relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser as necessary and
customary in connection with the Financing, (vi) furnishing Purchaser and the
Financing Parties with financial and other information regarding the
Pharmaceuticals Business as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist
in preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for
the completion of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
(vii) using its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its
independent accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance,
including participation in due diligence sessions and providing customary
comfort letters and any consents required under the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (viii) cooperating reasonably
with Purchasers financing sources due diligence and with their efforts to

security interests in Pharmaceutical Business Assets intended to constitute
collateral securing such financing, with such cooperation occurring prior to
or simultaneously with the Closing, but the execution of any guarantees or
security arrangements not taking effect until the Closing, in each case, to
the extent customary and reasonable; _provided_ that neither PandG nor any of
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing)
shall (A) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee under the
Financing, (B) have any liability or any obligation under any
credit agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document
related to the Financing (or alternative financing that Purchaser may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (C) be
required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing (or
any alternative financing that Purchaser may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) unless reimbursed or reasonably
satisfactorily indemnified by Purchaser. Purchaser (i) shall promptly, upon
request by PandG, reimburse PandG for 50% of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by PandG, any
of its Affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the
cooperation of PandG and its Affiliates contemplated by this Section 5.05;
_provided_ , that Purchasers aggregate reimbursement obligation pursuant to
this clause (i) shall be limited to a maximum of $1,500,000, (ii)
acknowledges and agrees that PandG and its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing) shall not have any responsibility

alternative financing that Purchaser may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) shall indemnify and hold
harmless PandG and its Affiliates and their respective representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any information used in connection therewith, except (x) with respect to
any information provided by PandG or any of its Affiliates in writing for
inclusion in customary offering documents and (y) for any of the foregoing to
the extent the same is the result of willful misconduct or bad faith of PandG,
any such Affiliate or their respective Representatives. " _Marketing Period_
" means a single period of 20 consecutive Business Days commencing on the
fourth Business Day following the delivery by PandG to Purchaser of the Audited
Financial Statements, all Required Interim Financial Statements required as
of such commencement date,

Marketing Period pursuant to this Section 5.05, and during which period
Purchaser shall have all Required Interim Financial Statements and other
information required pursuant to this Section 5.05, and ending no later than
the Outside Date.

(c) In the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified, including as a result of obtaining alternative
financing in accordance with Section 5.05(a), or if Purchaser substitutes
other debt or equity financing for all or a portion of the Financing, each of
Purchaser and PandG shall comply with its covenants in clauses (a) and (b) of
Section 5.05 and with respect to the Commitment Letter as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other
debt or equity financing to the same extent that Purchaser and PandG would have
been obligated to comply with respect to the Financing.

(d) PandG shall cause its internal legal counsel to provide reasonable
assistance to Purchaser and Purchasers counsel in connection with
the rendering of any legal opinions as may be reasonably necessary in
connection with the Financing, in each case in customary form and of customary
scope for the applicable jurisdiction and a transaction such as the Financing;
_provided_ , that PandGs internal counsel shall not be required to render any
such opinion. PandG shall consent to Purchasers retention of PandGs existing
outside counsel for the limited purpose of rendering any opinion of a type
described above.

SECTION 5.06. _Certain Authorizations and Third Party Consents_.

(a) Prior to the Closing and for a reasonable period not to exceed one year
thereafter, PandG, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Authorizations, and all
consents and waivers from third parties, necessary or appropriate to permit
the consummation of the Acquisition and the conduct of the Pharmaceuticals
Business by the Purchaser and the Purchasing Affiliates following the Closing
in the manner conducted by PandG and its affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing. The obligations of PandG and Purchaser to bear any fees payable to
third parties required in order to obtain any consents or waivers of third
parties, shall be subject to the provisions of Schedule 5.06. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (i) except as set
forth on Schedule 5.06, the "reasonable best efforts" of a party shall not
require it to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in
favor of) any Person from whom any such Authorization, consent or waiver may
be required other than nominal filing or application fees and (ii) in
connection with obtaining any Authorization from a third party related to a
Pharmaceuticals Business Contract, no material amendment, waiver, consent or
other changes will be made to any such Pharmaceuticals Business Contract
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably
withheld).

(b) Subject to Section 5.16, if and to the extent the valid, complete and
perfected transfer or assignment (or novation, if applicable) to Purchaser of
any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset as of the Closing Date would be a violation
of applicable Law, would require any Authorization or any third party
approval, consent or waiver then, the applicable transfer or  



 

49  assignment shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported
transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all
legal impediments are removed and/or such Authorization and/or third party
approval, consents or waivers have been obtained. If any Pharmaceutical
Business Asset is not transferred or assigned to Purchaser at Closing as a
result of this Section 5.06(b) or for any other reason, then for two years,
PandG shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts (with any out of pocket expenses
incurred by PandG being subject to the provisions of Schedule 5.06) to retain
such Pharmaceuticals Business Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as
reasonably possible, of Purchaser or a Purchasing Affiliate and implement an
arrangement with the intent that Purchaser or such Purchasing Affiliate shall
obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of such third party or
violating any applicable Law) the economic claims, rights and benefits under
any such Pharmaceuticals Business Asset and (ii) take such other actions as
may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to place Purchaser, insofar
as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such Pharmaceuticals
Business Asset had been transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the
benefits and burdens relating to such Pharmaceuticals Business Asset,
including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion,
control and command over such Pharmaceuticals Business Assets, are to inure
from and after the Closing to Purchaser; _provided_ , that to the extent that
the Transition Services Agreement provides for a means for Purchaser and its
Affiliates to have access to such Pharmaceuticals Business Asset, the
provisions of the Transitional Services Agreement shall apply in lieu of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii). Without limiting the foregoing, at the
reasonable request and expense of Purchaser, PandG shall cooperate with
Purchaser to enforce any rights or remedies PandG or its Affiliates may have
with respect to any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset the transfer of which is
delayed or not completed on the Closing Date. For no additional consideration
and at such time as PandG and Purchaser agree after obtaining the applicable
Authorization, consent or waiver, if obtained prior to the expiration of the
two-year period specified above, PandG shall cause any such Pharmaceuticals
Business Asset to be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred and delivered to
Purchaser and Purchaser shall purchase, acquire, accept and assume such
Pharmaceuticals Business Asset.

SECTION 5.07. _Intercompany Agreements and Accounts, Cash Extraction
Transactions_. (a) 

(i) From time to time prior to the Closing Date, all intercompany accounts
receivable and accounts payable between a Transferred Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and a PandG Affiliate (other than a Transferred Subsidiary), on the other
hand, shall be netted.

(ii) Any net positive A/R balance or cash in the Transferred Subsidiaries,
after the netting in clause (i), shall be distributed, transferred or
otherwise used in the manner set forth in Schedule 5.07, to the extent and in
the manner provided therein, and PandG shall be permitted to take the actions
outlined in Schedule 5.07. PandG (x) prior to implementing the capital
reductions described in Schedule 5.07, shall involve Purchaser in all
decisions regarding the actual implementation thereof and shall provide to
Purchaser for its review and comment (which comments PandG shall consider in
good faith) all documents proposed to be used to implement such capital
reductions, and (y) will keep Purchaser reasonably informed of all other
actions it undertakes pursuant to Schedule 5.07, including, where reasonably
practicable, providing Purchaser with advance notice of such actions and
documentation relating to any distributions, transfers or other uses. Any net
positive A/R balance not distributed, transferred or otherwise used in the
manner set forth in Schedule 5.07 prior to Closing shall be settled in cash on
or before the Closing.



 

50 (iii) As soon as practicable but in no event less than 14 days prior to any
proposed distribution, transfer or other use by PandG prior to the Closing of
cash not described in Schedule 5.07, PandG shall provide to Purchaser a written
statement describing such intended distribution, transfer or other use, and
setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the amount of cash to
be so distributed, transferred or otherwise used. Purchaser shall review such
intended distribution, transfer or other use, and the amounts thereof, to
determine whether it will result in any adverse consequences (other than
immaterial consequences) to Purchaser or its Affiliates. PandG shall provide, as
soon as reasonably practicable, such information as Purchaser may reasonably
request for purposes of such review. In the event that Purchaser reasonably
believes that such distribution, transfer or other use would result in any
adverse consequences (other than immaterial consequences) to Purchaser or its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall so notify PandG in writing within 7 days after the
receipt of such written statement, and the parties shall thereafter negotiate
in good faith for 5 days to resolve any disagreement as to whether such
distribution, transfer or other use would result in such adverse consequences
(other than immaterial consequences) to Purchaser or its Affiliates. If
Purchaser and PandG fail to resolve such dispute within 5 days, the Tax
Accounting Referee (as defined in Section 5.14(m)) shall resolve such dispute.
Prior to the expiration of such 14-day period, PandG shall not effect such
distribution, transfer or other use, and, in the event that Purchaser timely
provides a notice of disagreement as provided in the previous sentence, PandG
shall not effect such distribution, transfer or other use prior to the
resolution of such dispute.

(b) (i) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, PandG shall deliver to Purchaser
a statement (the " _Cash Balance Statement_ ") setting forth the amount of
cash held by each Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall have the right to review the Cash Balance Statement, and PandG shall,
as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide such information as Purchaser
may reasonably request for purposes of such review. If within 15 days after
receipt of the Cash Balance Statement Purchaser notifies PandG that it disagrees
with the one or more of the amounts reflected on the Cash Balance Statement,
Purchaser and PandG will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If
Purchaser and PandG fail to resolve such dispute within 30 days, the Tax
Accounting Referee (as defined in Section 5.14(m)) shall resolve such
dispute. If Purchaser does not respond within 30 days, or upon resolution of
the disputed items, each Transferred Subsidiary shall be deemed as of the
Closing Date to hold an amount of cash (the " _Trapped Cash_ ") equal to the
amount so reflected on the Cash Balance Statement (such as may have been
adjusted pursuant to the resolution of a dispute with respect thereto).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but only to
the extent it is not transferred to PandG or an Affiliate thereof pursuant to
this Section 5.07, all Trapped Cash shall be deemed to be Pharmaceuticals
Business Assets (but for the avoidance of doubt, Trapped Cash shall not be
taken into account in the determination of Closing Adjusted Working Capital,
Estimated Closing Adjusted Working Capital or Final Closing Adjusted Working
Capital).



 

51 (iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after Closing Date, Purchaser shall
take the actions set forth under clause (c) of Schedule 5.07. In addition to
taking those actions, Purchaser shall consider in good faith any other actions
(the " _Post-Closing Non-Scheduled Actions_ ") proposed, within one year of
the Closing Date, by PandG to cause the Trapped Cash to be distributed to
Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof) and remitted to PandG. To the extent it
reasonably determines that a Post-Closing Non-Scheduled Action will not result
in any adverse consequences (other than immaterial consequences) to Purchaser
or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
implement such actions; _provided_ that (i) Purchaser shall not be obligated
to engage in any transaction pursuant to this Section 5.07(b) where the
amount to be paid to PandG, after taking any reduction in such amount pursuant
to Section 5.07(c), would not exceed $500,000 and (ii) Purchaser shall not be
obligated to implement any Post-Closing Non-Scheduled Action that cannot,
with reasonable best efforts of Purchaser, be initiated within one year of
Closing.

(iv) If, after any distribution, transfer or use of cash pursuant to this
Section 5.07, Purchaser or any Affiliate is subsequently required under
applicable Law to recontribute or retransfer all or any portion of such amount
to the Transferred Subsidiary that made such distribution, transfer or other
use because such distribution, transfer or other use was, in whole or in part,
in violation of applicable Law, Purchaser shall notify PandG of such requirement
and provide a detailed calculation of the amounts required to be
recontributed. Purchaser and PandG shall cooperate in good faith to effect a
solution that would not result in any adverse consequences (other than
immaterial consequences) to Purchaser or its Affiliates, and that would not
require such recontribution. If Purchaser and PandG agree that no such solution
can be found, PandG shall promptly repay to Purchaser (or, at the option of
Purchaser, its Affiliate) an amount equal to the amount that Purchaser or
such Affiliate is required to so recontribute or retransfer. If Purchaser and
PandG disagree as to whether any such solution can be effected, and fail to
resolve such dispute within 30 days, the Tax Accounting Referee (as
defined in Section 5.14(m)) shall resolve such dispute.

(c) PandG shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including withholding Taxes and any Taxes resulting from any distribution or
transfer made by a Transferred Subsidiary) incurred by Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred
Subsidiaries after the Closing) in connection with any obligation of or
transaction undertaken by Purchaser or such Affiliates pursuant to this
Section 5.07. Purchaser (i) shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize such
costs and expenses (except that Purchaser shall not be required to take any
action that would result in adverse consequences (other than immaterial
consequences) to Purchaser or its Affiliates) and (ii) if Purchaser expects to
incur any such costs or expenses in connection with a cash distribution,
transfer or other use that are expected to exceed the greater of $50,000 or 5%
of the amount of such cash distribution, transfer or other use, shall advise
and consult with PandG regarding such proposed cost or expense in advance
of incurring any such cost or expense. Purchaser shall provide a detailed
calculation of any amounts (the " _Section 5.07(c) Reduction Amounts_ ") by
which Purchaser proposes to reduce any amounts otherwise payable to PandG
pursuant to this Section 5.07. Purchaser shall provide PandG with such
information as PandG may reasonably request with respect to Purchasers
determination of any Section 5.07(c) Reduction Amount. If, within 10 days of
Purchasers  



 

52  proposal of a Section 5.07(c) Reduction Amount, PandG notifies Purchaser of
its objection to the reasonableness of a Section 5.07(c) Reduction Amount,
Purchaser and PandG shall cooperate in good faith to determine an appropriate
adjustment, if any, thereto. If Purchaser and PandG do not agree on such an
adjustment within 30 days, the Tax Accounting Referee (as defined in Section
5.14(m)) shall resolve such dispute. Purchaser shall be permitted to withhold
from the related payment to PandG an amount equal to Purchasers initially
proposed Section 5.07(c) Reduction Amount until any dispute is
resolved pursuant to this Section 5.07(c).

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, PandG shall take, or cause to be taken, all
necessary actions to cause all intercompany agreements between PandG or its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be terminated as of the
Closing.

SECTION 5.08. _Publicity_. Neither PandG, on the one hand, nor Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall issue or permit any of their respective Affiliates to issue
any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other
party, except as may be required by applicable Law or stock exchange rules or
regulations (in which case, to the extent possible, the party required to make
the release or statement shall allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or statement in advance of such issuance); _provided_
,  _however_ , that each of the parties may make internal announcements to
their respective employees that are consistent with the parties prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 5.09. _Transferred Subsidiaries; Pharmaceuticals Business Assets;
Excluded Assets; Transition Period Assets; Retained Employees_. (a) Prior to
the Closing, PandG shall use its reasonable best efforts to work with Purchaser
to identify all Pharmaceuticals Business Assets held by PandG or any of its
Affiliates. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any
event not more than 45 days after the date hereof, PandG shall provide Purchaser
with (i) a final version of Schedule 1.01(g) to reflect any additions to or
removals from the list of Transferred Subsidiaries as a result of
such identification, which final Schedule shall be deemed to be the
definitive Schedule 1.01(g) for all purposes of this Agreement; (ii) schedules
identifying or describing any Pharmaceuticals Business Assets that are held as
of such date by PandG or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and that will be transferred to a Transferred Subsidiary prior
to the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing Transferred Assets_ "); (iii) schedules
identifying or describing any Direct Assignment Assets; and (iv) schedules
identifying or setting forth any Excluded Assets that are held as of such date
by the Transferred Subsidiaries and that will be transferred to PandG or its
Affiliates (other than a Transferred Subsidiary) prior to the Closing (the "
_Pre-Closing Distribution Assets_ "). The determination of the composition of
Schedule 1.01(g), and the designation of any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset as
a Pre-Closing Transferred Asset or a Direct Assignment Asset shall be made by
PandG in good faith, after consultation with Purchaser (which shall include
consideration in good faith of any proposals made by Purchaser with respect to
such matters), and in a manner consistent with the principles set forth on
Schedule 5.09(a), except for any deviations therefrom consented to by
Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). The asset and
liability transfers and related transactions contemplated by this Section
5.09(a) and Section 5.07(a) are referred to as the " _Pre-Closing
Reorganization_ ".



 

53 (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in the course of preparing for the
implementation of the services contemplated by the Transition Services
Agreement PandG may identify certain Assets included within the Pharmaceuticals
Business Assets (the " _Transition Period Assets_ "), that are necessary or
desirable for PandG to retain in order to provide the services contemplated by
the Transition Services Agreement. At PandGs request, Purchaser may elect to
(i) exclude any Transition Period Asset from the Pharmaceuticals Business
Assets at the Closing, and (ii) allow PandG to retain such Transition Period
Asset during the term of the Transition Services Agreement, in which case as
soon as practicable following the expiration of the applicable services
contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, PandG shall convey such
Transition Period Asset to the Purchaser for no additional consideration.

(c) Prior to the Closing, PandG shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each employee of a Transferred Subsidiary that is not an Article 6 Employee,
including any Retained Employees, to be reassigned to PandG or an Affiliate
other than a Transferred Subsidiary. 

(d) After the Closing, if PandG or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) is the owner of, receives or otherwise comes to
possess any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset (including the receipt of payments
made pursuant to Contracts and proceeds of accounts receivable) or any other
asset that properly belongs to Purchaser or its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Subsidiaries) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
PandG promptly shall notify Purchaser at the address set forth in Section 10.04
and transfer or cause to be transferred, such Pharmaceuticals Business Asset
to Purchaser (or to the Transferred Subsidiary or other Affiliate designated
by Purchaser). After the Closing, if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries) is the owner of, receives or
otherwise comes to possess any Excluded Asset (including the receipt of
payments made pursuant to Contracts and proceeds of accounts receivable) or
any other asset that properly belongs to PandG or its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Purchaser promptly shall notify PandG at the address set forth in Section 10.04
and transfer or cause to be transferred, such Excluded Asset to PandG (or to the
Affiliate of PandG designated by PandG). With respect to any assets subject to
this Section 5.09(d) consisting of cash, in lieu of remitting payment, PandG or
Purchaser, as applicable, may set off any amounts otherwise required to be
remitted to the other party pursuant to this Section 5.09(d) against any
amounts owed to such party or any of its Affiliates by the other party or any
of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

SECTION 5.10. _Use of P andG Names and Marks_. (a) As soon as practicable
following the Closing, and in any event within 180 days after the Closing,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) change the name of any
Transferred Subsidiary whose name includes the PandG Names and Marks to a name
that does not include any of the PandG Names and Marks; and (ii) remove all PandG
Names and Marks from any internet or other electronic communications vehicles,
including internet domain names.

(b) In each applicable jurisdiction, as soon as practicable following the
Closing, and in any event within one year after the Closing (or to the extent
a longer period of time is required to obtain any required approvals of
applicable health authorities in such jurisdiction for such changes, within
one year after receipt of all such required approvals), (the " _Transition
Date_ ") Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) remove all
PandG Names and Marks from any  



 

54  new packaging or prescription information of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates manufactured after the applicable Transition Date for use in
such jurisdiction and (ii) revise all packaging and prescription information
used in such jurisdiction to delete, strike over, sticker over or otherwise
remove or cover all references to the PandG Names and Marks. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in each jurisdiction, the Purchaser and its Affiliates may
continue to sell existing inventories of products as of the Transition Date
bearing the PandG Names and Marks until the expiration of the applicable shelf
lives of such products;  _provided_ , that the Purchaser and its Affiliates
use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell such existing inventories
prior to the sale of subsequently manufactured or packaged products.

(c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, remove all PandG Names and Marks from any new product
literature, signage, stationary or other materials (other than any internet
or other electronic communications vehicles, including internet domain names,
which are subject to Section 5.10(a) and other than packaging or prescription
materials, which are the subject of Section 5.10(a)) of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates purchased or created after the Closing Date; _provided_ , that
the Purchaser and its Affiliates may continue to use the existing inventories
of such items as of the Closing Date until such inventories are exhausted.

(d) In no event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates use any PandG Names and
Marks after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the
use of such PandG Names and Marks by the Pharmaceuticals Business during the
90-day period preceding the Closing. PandG reserves the right to practice
reasonable quality control with regard to the PandG Names and Marks. " _P andG
Names and Marks_" means the names and marks "Procter and Gamble" and "PandG" (in
any style or design) and any name or mark derived from, confusingly similar
to or including any of the foregoing.

SECTION 5.11. _P andG Guarantees_. Purchaser acknowledges that in the course
of conduct of the Pharmaceuticals Business, PandG and its Affiliates may have
entered into various arrangements in which guarantees, bonds or similar
arrangements were issued by PandG or its Affiliates to support or facilitate the
Pharmaceuticals Business. The arrangements of this type entered into by PandG
and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), including those
set forth in Section 5.11 of the PandG Disclosure Letter, are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Guarantees_ ". Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
the Guarantees shall not continue after the Closing. Purchaser agrees that it
shall use its reasonable best efforts (without any obligation, however, to (x)
spend any money other than customary amounts in connection with arranging
such substitute arrangements or (y) commence or threaten to commence any
litigation) to obtain or provide replacement Guarantees which will be in
effect at the Closing and obtain the release of PandG and its Affiliates from
any Guarantees. In the event that Purchaser is unable to obtain the release of
PandG or its Affiliates from any Guarantees, Purchaser shall indemnify PandG and
its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses incurred by any of them
relating to the Guarantees.

SECTION 5.12. _Bulk Sales Law_. Each of PandG and Purchaser hereby waives
compliance by PandG with the provisions of all applicable so called "bulk sales"
or "bulk transfer" laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



 

55 SECTION 5.13. _OTC Rights and Arrangements_.

(a) _Certain License Rights_. Purchaser shall notify PandG promptly after the
time it commences marketing the rights to develop or market a version of
risedronate that can be distributed or sold without a prescription from a
medical doctor and/or marketing a license to the Actonel trademark (" _Section
5.13 Rights_ ") to any Person and provide to PandG the same information it
provides to other Persons relating to such rights. Prior to entering into any
agreement with any Person that grants any Section 5.13 Rights, Purchaser shall
provide PandG notice of such event, including the terms of the potential grant,
together with a copy of the definitive agreements proposed to be executed by
such Person, and the right to elect to acquire such Section 5.13 Rights on
substantially the same terms as set forth in such agreement, with
such modifications as PandG reasonably requests so long as such modifications
do not in any material way adversely affect the rights and benefits of
Purchaser. PandG shall have 30 days to elect to acquire any Section 5.13 Rights,
and if so elected, Purchaser and PandG shall negotiate in good faith the terms
of such agreement. In the event Purchaser decides to develop and market OTC
Actonel directly, it shall first provide PandG the opportunity for 90 days to
negotiate in good faith with Purchaser to enter into an agreement to permit
PandG to develop and market OTC Actonel.

(b) _Calcium plus Vitamin D_. Purchaser hereby grants to PandG and its
Affiliates, effective upon the Closing, an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide,
royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable license, including the right to
sublicense, to the Calcium Plus Vitamin D IP to develop, make, use, import,
offer to sell and sell any product that can be distributed or sold without a
prescription from a medical doctor.

SECTION 5.14. _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Prior to the Closing Date, the parties
shall agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among the Transferred
Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in Schedule
5.14(a), including adopting the intangible values set forth in such schedule
unless otherwise mutually agreed. If the Purchase Price is adjusted after the
parties agree to such an allocation (including pursuant to Section 9.09
hereof), then appropriate adjustments as determined by the parties in good
faith shall be made to such allocation. 

(b) _Section 338 Elections_.

(i) Each of PandG and Purchaser agree to make, or cause to be made, a timely,
effective and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
under any comparable statutes in any other jurisdiction (the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary that is
listed on Schedule 1.01(g) as having a jurisdiction of organization in a state
in the United States (the " _U.S. Transferred Subsidiary_ "), and to file
such election in accordance with applicable regulations. Purchaser shall
deliver to PandG a statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the
ADSP (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4) (the "
_Aggregate Deemed Sales Price_ ") of the assets of the U.S. Transferred
Subsidiary in accordance with the Treasury regulations promulgated under
Section 338(h)(10). PandG shall have the  



 

56  right to review the Allocation Statement. If within 30 days after receipt of
the Allocation Statement PandG notifies Purchaser in writing that
the allocation of one or more items reflected in the Allocation Statement is
not a reasonable allocation, Purchaser and PandG will negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and PandG fail to resolve such dispute within
30 days, the Tax Accounting Referee (as defined in Section 5.14(m)) shall
determine whether the allocation was reasonable and, if not reasonable, shall
appropriately revise the Allocation Statement. If PandG does not respond within
30 days, or upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected
on the Allocation Statement (as such may have been adjusted) shall be the "
_Price Allocation_ " and shall be binding on the parties hereto. PandG and
Purchaser agree to act in accordance with the Price Allocation in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return.

(ii) Purchaser shall make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and
under any comparable statute in any other jurisdiction with respect to each
Transferred Subsidiary listed on Schedule 1.01(g), other than the U.S.
Transferred Subsidiary, that is taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

(c) _Ordinary Course._ Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of Purchaser
to: (x) take any action or omit to take any action on or after the Closing
Date other than in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited
to the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption,
that could give rise to any Tax liability, or reduce any Tax Asset, of PandG or
any Affiliate of PandG or give rise to any loss of PandG or any Affiliate of PandG
under this Agreement, or (y) (i) make or change any Tax election, amend any
Tax Return or take any Tax position on any Tax Return; or (ii) other than in
the ordinary course of business take any action, omit to take any action or
enter into any transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in any
increased Tax liability or reduction in any Tax Asset of PandG or any Affiliate
of PandG (including for purposes of this clause (y), the Transferred
Subsidiaries) in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period. In addition, prior to
June 30, 2010, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to maintain
the Pharmaceuticals Business activities in the canton of Geneva in compliance
with all requirements expressly stated in the tax ruling dated November 8,
2000, from the Republique et Canton de Geneve, previously provided to
Purchaser, without regard to any other documents, submissions, applications,
covenants or statements (whether or not expressly, impliedly or otherwise
referenced, incorporated, or deemed a part thereof).

(d) Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, none of PandG, any Transferred Subsidiary or any Affiliate
of PandG shall, to the extent it may affect or relate to any
Transferred Subsidiary, for any Post-Closing Tax Period, make or change any
Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any
method of Tax accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing
agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a
Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment or take or omit to take any other action, if any such action or
omission would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or
materially reducing any Tax Asset of any Transferred Subsidiary, Purchaser or
any Affiliate of Purchaser. This Section 5.14(d) shall not restrict PandG and
its Affiliates from designating any of the non-U.S. Transferred Subsidiaries
as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



 

57 (e) _Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns_. PandG shall prepare and timely file
(or cause to be prepared and timely filed) the following Tax Returns in
accordance with past practice for preparing and filing such Tax Returns and
shall pay Taxes shown as due thereon: (A) all Tax Returns of the Transferred
Subsidiaries due on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) all Income Tax
Returns of the Transferred Subsidiaries due after the Closing Date in the case
of a combined, consolidated or unitary Income Tax Return that includes PandG or
an Affiliate (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries). PandG shall timely
prepare (or cause to be timely prepared) any Income Tax Return of a
Transferred Subsidiary for a taxable period of such Transferred Subsidiary
ending on or before the Closing Date; Purchaser shall timely file (or cause
to be timely filed) such Income Tax Return prepared by PandG and shall pay Taxes
shown as due thereon; and PandG shall reimburse Purchaser (or, at Purchasers
direction, the applicable Transferred Subsidiary) for the amount of
such Taxes paid by Purchaser. In addition, PandG shall include the U.S.
Transferred Subsidiary that is a member of its consolidated group in its
consolidated Federal Tax return and in any Combined State Tax Return through
the close of business on the Closing Date.

(f) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_.

(i) As to any Income Tax Return of a Transferred Subsidiary for a tax period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
Purchaser shall cause such Transferred Subsidiary to prepare and timely file
(or cause to be prepared and timely filed) such Tax Return and pay all Taxes
due with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that PandG shall, or shall
cause its Affiliate to, reimburse Purchaser for any amount owed by PandG with
respect to such Tax Return in accordance with Article IX; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , as to any Tax Return for which PandG may be liable for
an indemnity under Article IX: (A) Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax Return
to PandG at least 30 days before it is due, (B) PandG shall have the right to
examine and comment on any such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof, and
such Tax Return shall not be filed without the prior written consent of PandG,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (C) PandG shall
either provide such written consent or deliver a notice of objection no later
than 15 days before the Tax Return is due.

(ii) PandG and Purchaser shall make (or cause any of their Affiliates to make)
any election available under applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the
end of a relevant taxable period.

(g) _Amended Tax Returns_. After the Closing Date, none of Purchaser, any
Transferred Subsidiary or any affiliate of Purchaser shall, without the prior
written consent of PandG, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, file any amended Tax Return if PandG might be liable for additional
Taxes on such Tax Return under Article IX.

(h) Prior to the Closing, no Transferred Subsidiary shall make any payment of,
or in respect of, any Tax to any Person or any Taxing Authority, except to the
extent such payment is in respect of a Tax that is due or payable or has been
properly estimated in accordance with applicable Law as applied in a manner
consistent with past practice of PandG.



 

58 (i) _Cooperation_. PandG and Purchaser shall each reasonably cooperate, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing
all Tax Returns of the Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the
Pharmaceuticals Business or the Pharmaceuticals Business Assets, including
(A) maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes and in the defense or resolution of any Tax claim, audit
or assessment, whether in connection with an audit or otherwise and (B)
making available for consultation knowledgeable personnel in connection with
such Tax matters. Each of Purchaser, PandG and their respective Affiliates will
need access, from time to time after the Closing Date, to certain accounting
and Tax records and information held by PandG, Purchaser or their respective
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) to the extent such records
and information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing. Therefore,
Purchaser and PandG shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates
(including each Transferred Subsidiary) to, (i) retain all records relating to
Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries and with respect to the Pharmaceuticals
Business Assets for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statutes of limitation (including any extensions
thereof) for the taxable period or periods to which such records relate;
and (ii) allow the other party and its agents and representatives (and agents
or representatives of any of its Affiliates), at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as such other party may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at such other
partys expense. Purchaser and PandG further agree, upon request, to use all
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or customer of any Transferred Subsidiary or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including but not limited to with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby). Each party shall promptly reimburse the other for such
other partys reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with requests made
by such first party under this Section 5.14(i), but no other charges shall be
payable by the requesting party to the other party in connection with such
requests.

(j) _Refunds and Credits_. Any refund or credit of Income Taxes relating to
any Transferred Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or other Taxes
which for which PandG is responsible under Article IX) shall be for the account
of PandG. Any other refund or credit of Income Taxes relating to any
Transferred Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the
account of Purchaser. Purchaser shall, if PandG so requests and at PandGs
expense, file for and obtain or cause the relevant Transferred Subsidiary or
any of its Affiliates to file for and obtain any refunds or credits to which
PandG is entitled under this Section 5.14(j), and shall promptly remit any such
refund to PandG after the receipt thereof. Purchaser and the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall permit PandG to control the prosecution of any such refund
claim. If PandG pays (or causes any Transferred Subsidiary to pay prior to the
Closing) estimated Income Taxes for any Straddle Period in excess of
the amount ultimately determined to be due for the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and Purchaser obtains the benefit of such
excess payment, Purchaser shall promptly refund such excess to PandG.



 

59 (k) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. PandG shall cause the provisions of any Tax
Sharing Agreement between PandG or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any Transferred Subsidiary, on
the other hand, to be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such
Tax Sharing Agreement.

(l) _Transfer Taxes_. All payments of Transfer Taxes shall be made by
the party required to make such payment under applicable Law. Each of
Purchaser and PandG shall reimburse the other party for fifty percent of all
Transfer Taxes paid by such other party. Upon payment of any such Transfer
Tax, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is
entitled under this Section 5.14(l) together with such supporting evidence as
is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-
paying party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than
10 days after the presentation of such statement. Any payment not made within
such time shall bear interest at the rate specified in Section 2.07(c) for
each day until paid. PandG and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection with the
payment of Transfer Taxes. Each of PandG and Purchaser, as appropriate, shall
execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the
other to comply with any filing requirements relating to any such Transfer
Taxes.

(m) _Certain Disputes_. Disputes arising under Section 5.14 or 9.01 and not
resolved by mutual agreement within 30 days shall be resolved by
an accounting firm (the " _Tax Accounting Referee_ "), chosen and mutually
acceptable to both Purchaser and PandG within five days of the date on which the
need to choose the Tax Accounting Referee arises. The Tax Accounting
Referee shall resolve any disputed items within 30 days of having the item
referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees
and expenses of the Tax Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Purchaser
and PandG.

 

(n) _P andG Options_. PandG shall claim, and none of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates shall claim, for U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax
purposes, any deduction attributable to the exercise in any Post-Closing Tax
Period by any Article 6 Employee of an option granted by PandG or any of its
Affiliates to purchase PandG stock. If, as a result of an audit adjustment
or otherwise, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is allowed a deduction for
U.S. federal, state or foreign income tax purposes attributable to the
exercise of any such option, Purchaser shall notify PandG that such deduction
has been allowed and shall pay to PandG an amount equal to any cash benefit
actually realized as a result of such deduction, promptly after the
realization of such cash benefit.

(o) PandG or an Affiliate thereof shall make a valid election, effective prior
to the Closing Date, to cause Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals Puerto Rico,
LLC to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

SECTION 5.15. _Outsourced Items_.

(a) _Equipment_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the HP Leased
Equipment is currently leased from HP and is not included in
the Pharmaceuticals Business Assets. Prior to the Closing Purchaser may enter
into an agreement with HP to purchase the HP Leased  



 

60  Equipment effective as of the Closing (or, as of the expiration of the
relevant service under the Transition Services Agreement, in the case of any
HP Leased Equipment used to provide such services). As soon as practicable
following the Closing (or, following the expiration of the relevant service
under the Transition Services Agreement, in the case of any HP Leased
Equipment used to provide such services) on the terms and subject to the
conditions contemplated by the HP services Agreement (or such other terms and
conditions that Purchaser is able to negotiate with HP), subject to receipt of
confirmation from HP that Purchaser has purchased the HP Leased Equipment,
PandG shall make the HP Leased Equipment available to Purchaser. Promptly upon
taking possession of any HP Leased Equipment, Purchaser shall remove all
software from the HP Leased Equipment except for any Pharmaceuticals Business
Software to which Purchaser acquires rights pursuant to Section 5.15(c) and,
to the extent of any remaining term for the applicable services, any software
the Purchaser is expressly permitted to use pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement. PandG shall make any other outsourced equipment available
to Purchaser to the extent, and on the terms, provided in the Transition
Services Agreement.

(b) _Certain Non-U.S. Employee Vehicles_. Prior to the Closing, PandG shall use
its reasonable best efforts to work with Purchaser to identify any leased
motor vehicles used or held for use by a Continuing Employee where such
Continuing Employee is lessee but lease payments are made (or reimbursed) by
PandG or its Affiliates (the " _Reimbursed Auto Lease_ "). PandG and Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith to implement an arrangement so that from and
after the Closing such Continuing Employee may continue to use the motor
vehicle subject to the applicable Reimbursed Auto Lease and the economic
benefits and burdens of such Reimbursed Auto Lease are transferred to
a Transferred Subsidiary or Purchasing Affiliate on a basis consistent with
the transfer of economic benefits and burdens of automobile leases where PandG
or an Affiliate is the lessee that are transferred to Purchaser or a
Purchasing Affiliate at the Closing.

(c) _Certain Licensed Pharmaceuticals Business Software_. With respect to any
licensed software application included within the Pharmaceuticals Business
Software as to which the applicable license agreement was not disclosed to
Purchaser prior to the date hereof, Purchaser shall have the option to have
the applicable license treated as a Pharmaceuticals Business Asset for all
purposes of this Agreement and assigned by PandG or its Affiliate, as
applicable, to Purchaser (subject to the proviso in clause (y) of the
definition of "Pharmaceuticals Business Assets" and Section 5.06), or have
such license treated as an Excluded Asset for all purposes of this Agreement
and retained by PandG and its Affiliates.

SECTION 5.16. _Weiterstadt Preemption Right_. (a) Promptly after the date
hereof, PandG shall cause Procter and Gamble Grundstucks- und Vermogensverwaltungs
GmbH and Co. KG (" _P andG KG_"), the owner of the manufacturing facility in
Weiterstadt, Germany identified on Schedule 1.01(d)(v) (the " _Weiterstadt
Facility_ "), to seek to obtain from the Weiterstadt, Germany, local authority
a waiver, statement or other certificate with respect to a Weiterstadt
Waiver. Purchaser acknowledges that a binding waiver or statement by the local
authority can only be obtained upon signing of the Weiterstadt Purchase
Agreement.

(b) Promptly after the date hereof, PandG shall cause PandG KG and Procter and
Gamble Pharmaceuticals-Germany GmbH (" _P andG GmbH_") to amend the terms of
the existing lease  



 

61  between such parties related to the Weiterstadt Facility (the " _Weiterstadt
Lease_ ") to reflect the terms set forth on Schedule 5.16 and otherwise on
terms reasonably acceptable to PandG and Purchaser.

(c) Promptly after the date hereof but after implementing the amendments to
the Weiterstadt Lease referred to in Section 5.16(b) above, PandG shall cause
PandG KG and PandG GmbH (the " _Weiterstadt Acquiring Subsidiary_ ") to enter into
a customary purchase agreement before a German notary public regarding the
sale and transfer of the Weiterstadt Facility from PandG KG to the PandG GmbH (the
" _Weiterstadt Purchase Agreement_ "). The Weiterstadt Purchase Agreement will
be on customary terms reasonably acceptable to PandG and Purchaser and will
provide for the sale and transfer of the ownership to the Weiterstadt Facility
without any consideration other than the amount set forth on Schedule 5.07
(the " _Weiterstadt Allocation_ "). The closing of the transfer of ownership
to the Weiterstadt Facility from PandG KG to PandG GmbH pursuant to the terms of
the Weiterstadt Purchase Agreement (the " _Weiterstadt Closing_ ") shall occur
either:

(i) immediately prior to the Closing if the German local authority has
previously (A) waived any preemption right under the German Statutory Code on
Construction and Building or issued a similar statement with respect to the
sale and transfer of the ownership to the Weiterstadt Facility from PandG KG to
the Weiterstadt Acquiring Subsidiary, (B) not exercised any such right within
the period of exercise under the German Statutory Code on Construction and
Building or (C) determined that no such right exists (any of (A), (B) or (C),
a " _Weiterstadt Waiver_ "); or

(ii) if a Weiterstadt Waiver has not been obtained prior to Closing,
immediately after obtaining a Weiterstadt Waiver.

(d) If the Weiterstadt, Germany local authority exercises its preemption right
under the German Statutory Code on Construction and Building (i) prior to
Closing, the Weiterstadt Allocation shall be deducted from the Purchase Price
or (ii) at Closing or thereafter, PandG agrees to promptly repay the Weiterstadt
Allocation to Purchaser.

(e) The Weiterstadt Lease shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
upon consummation of the Weiterstadt Closing. The Weiterstadt
Purchase Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if
the Weiterstadt, Germany local authority exercises its preemption right under
the German Statutory Code on Construction and Building.

SECTION 5.17. _Confidentiality_. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that the
information being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and PandG
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information to the
extent relating to the Pharmaceuticals Business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it
by PandG or its representatives concerning PandG or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.



 

62 (b) After the Closing, PandG and its Affiliates will hold, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence all confidential documents and other information concerning the
Pharmaceuticals Business. The obligation of PandG and its Affiliates to hold any
such information in confidence shall not extend to any information that is
(i) required to be disclosed by applicable Law, (ii) as necessary to defend or
prosecute any indemnification claim or any Proceeding, or (iii) except as a
result of a disclosure by PandG or its Affiliates after the Closing, generally
available to the public or already known by a third party receiving such
information from PandG or its Affiliates. The obligation of PandG and its
Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if
they exercise the same care with respect to such information as they would
take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar information.

SECTION 5.18. _No Hiring; Non-Competition_. (a) During the two-year period
that begins as of the Closing, (i) without the consent of PandG Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, hire any employee of PandG
or its Affiliates (other than the Continuing Employees) that had worked in the
Pharmaceuticals Business during the two years prior to the date hereof, and
(ii) without the consent of Purchaser PandG shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, hire any Continuing Employee. The restrictions on hiring
set forth in this Section 5.18 shall not apply to any employee of PandG or its
Affiliates or any Continuing Employee that has been terminated by PandG or
Purchaser, or their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, prior to any
discussions with the hiring party.

(b) PandG agrees that for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
the third anniversary of the Closing Date, neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall engage, either directly or indirectly, as a principal or for
its own account or solely or jointly with others, or as stockholders in any
corporation or joint stock association, in any Competing Business. A "
_Competing Business_ " means the business of manufacturing, marketing,
packaging, distributing and selling (i) a biphosphonate for the treatment or
prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, or (ii) an oral, non-steroidal
treatment of ulcerative colitis, in each case in the territories in which the
Pharmaceutical Business currently sells products for these indications.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.18(b), PandG shall not be
restricted from any of the following:

(i) owning for investment purposes up to ten percent of the securities in any
company;

(ii) acquiring one or more companies or business that includes within its
business a Competing Business so long as either (i) the Competing Business
constitutes no more than 25% of the revenue of the company or business being
acquired or (ii) PandG undertakes to commence within twelve months of the
acquisition a process to sell the Competing Business;

(iii) conducting any business with respect to any product that can be
distributed or sold without a prescription from a medical doctor; or 

(iv) fulfilling its obligations under the Transition Services Agreement or
providing any similar services to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.



 

63 (c) If any provision contained in this Section 5.18 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 5.18, but this Section 5.18 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to provide for a covenant
having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law. PandG agrees that Purchaser would be
irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section and that there would be no
adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate for any such breach. The
parties shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific performance
of this Section 5.18, and the parties consent to the entry thereof.

SECTION 5.19.  _Insurance Matters_. Except for the Pharmaceuticals Business
Insurance Claims, from and after the Closing Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause the Transferred Subsidiaries not to, assert any claim against any
insurance policies or practices of PandG and its Affiliates (including any
captive insurance policies, fronted insurance policies, surety bonds or
corporate insurance policies or practices, or any form of self-insurance
whatsoever). PandG shall cause any Transferred Subsidiary to assign to PandG,
effective upon Closing, all claims and/or rights to coverage and/or proceeds
under the insurance policy set forth on Schedule 1.01(a)(x) in connection with
the claims set forth on Schedule 1.01(a)(x). If any claims are identified
that may be made with respect to any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset or Assumed
Liability under any Third Party Liability Insurance with respect to any
occurrences prior to the Closing (except for claims identified in
Schedules 1.01(a)(x) and 1.01(d)(xiii)), PandG shall assign, or cause to be
assigned, to Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof such claims and the rights to
coverage and proceeds relating thereto, to the extent such assignment is
permitted under the terms of such policy, or shall otherwise use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make and administer such claims on behalf
of Purchaser.

SECTION 5.20. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested
by any party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such further
or other actions, as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, in the case of PandG, executing and delivering to Purchaser such
assignments, deeds, bills of sale, consents and other instruments as Purchaser
or its counsel may reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such
purpose (it being understood that no such assignment, deed, bill of sale,
consent or other instrument of transfer shall require PandG or its Affiliates to
make any additional representations, warranties or covenants, expressed or
implied, not contained in this Agreement). This Section 5.20 shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 5.06 with respect to PandGs obligations to obtain
any required Authorizations and consents of third parties.

SECTION 5.21. _Notice of Certain Events; Supplemental Disclosures_. Each party
shall promptly notify the other party of (i) any written notice from any
Person alleging that  



 

64  the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any written notice from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (iii) any inaccuracy of any its representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement, such that a condition precedent to the Closing
contained in Section 7.02(a) (in the case of notice by PandG) or Section
7.03(a) (in the case of notice by Purchaser), as applicable, would not be
satisfied at the Closing; and (iv) any failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; _provided, however,_ that except as provided in the following
sentence, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.21 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving that notice. If the Closing occurs notwithstanding the
delivery of a notice pursuant to clause (iii) of the foregoing sentence in
which the notifying party expressly acknowledges that the condition precedent
to the Closing contained in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as applicable,
would not be satisfied at Closing and accordingly that the receiving party is
not required to consummate the Closing, then such notice shall be deemed to
be a supplement to the PandG Disclosure Letter or Purchaser Disclosure Letter,
as applicable, and effective to cure and correct for all purposes (including,
without limitation, the provisions of Article IX) any breach of any
representation or warranty relating to the PandG Disclosure Letter or Purchaser
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, not having read at all times as so
supplemented. If a notice pursuant to clause (iii) is delivered less than
three Business Day in advance of the anticipated Closing Date, then the
parties shall, at the request of Purchaser, delay the anticipated Closing up
to three Business Days following such delivery The obligation to provide
notice pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of the first sentence of this
Section 5.21 shall not constitute an obligation or covenant of PandG or
Purchaser for purposes of Section 7.02(b) or Section 7.03(b).

SECTION 5.22. _European Interim Operating Provisions_.

(a) If, on a date on which the conditions under Article VII (other than the
condition set forth in Section 7.01(c)), shall have been satisfied or waived,
or could be satisfied on such date were the Closing to occur, any required
consultations with any works councils, economic committees or unions in any
jurisdiction have not been conducted to completion, or PandG has not received a
motivated opinion where required, then:

(i) the Pharmaceutical Business (whether in the form of stock or Assets),
including its Assets, Liabilities and employees in such jurisdiction will not
be transferred or delivered at the Closing and will remain part of PandG and be
operated by PandG under the terms of Section 5.22(c) until such condition has
been satisfied,

(ii) the condition in Section 7.01(c) shall be inapplicable for the purposes
of the Closing;

(iii) Purchaser shall assume all obligations under the Sanofi Collaboration
Agreement and, subject to Section 5.22(a)(i) with respect to any Assets and
Liabilities that do not transfer to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser shall
assume all obligations under all other Pharmaceuticals Business Contracts
pursuant Section 2.02, including as set forth on Schedule 5.22(a);

 



 

65 (iv) Purchaser shall continue the commissionaire and logistic agreements with
a Transferred Subsidiary until the transfer contemplated by clause (v) below
occurs;

(v) upon the satisfaction of such condition with respect to a jurisdiction
(subject to the provisions of Section 5.22(b)), PandG shall transfer, in
accordance with Section 2.01, as promptly as practicable to Purchaser the
Pharmaceutical Business, including its Assets, Liabilities and employees, in
such jurisdiction, that would have been transferred at Closing had such
condition been met.

(b) In France, in addition to the provisions of Section 5.22(a):

(i) the Pharmaceutical Business, including its Assets, Liabilities and
employees in France will not be transferred or delivered at the Closing and
will remain part of PandG and be operated by PandG under the terms of Section
5.22(c) until the approvals set forth on Schedule 5.22(b)(i) have been
obtained by Purchasers Affiliate in France; and

(ii) upon the satisfaction of such condition, PandG shall transfer,
in accordance with Section 2.01, as promptly as practicable the
Pharmaceutical Business, including its Assets, Liabilities and employees, in
France that would have been transferred at Closing had such condition been met
to Purchaser.

 

(c) During any period following the Closing that PandG operates the
Pharmaceutical Business in any such jurisdiction (each, a "
_Local Pharmaceutical Business_ ") PandG shall operate the Pharmaceutical
Business in compliance with Section 5.01 (except to the extent directed
otherwise by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.22(c)) for the benefit of
Purchaser, subject to Purchaser, acting through Procter and Gamble
Pharmaceuticals S.A.R.L., exercising the power to direct the management and
policies of the Local Pharmaceutical Business in a manner consistent with all
applicable Laws and consultation obligations to or requirements for works
council, economic committees or unions and subject to Schedule 5.22(c). It is
the intention of the parties to transfer the economic benefits and burdens of
the business as of Closing through this Section 5.22(c), although not
transferring the business or employees. All liabilities, profits and assets
arising from the conduct and operation of the business during this interim
operating period shall, upon the transfer contemplated under Section
5.22(a)(iv)(a)(v) and Section 5.22(b)(ii) become Assumed Liabilities and
Pharmaceutical Business Assets of Purchaser or its Affiliate to whom the Local
Pharmaceutical Business is transferred.

(d) With respect to France, PandG, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions, including those actions set forth on Schedule 5.22(d),
and to do or cause to be done all things necessary or appropriate, including
using their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all Authorizations,
including those set forth on, and in accordance with, Schedule 5.22(b)(i).
With respect to any jurisdiction subject to Section 5.22, PandG, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause to
be done all things necessary or appropriate, including using their respective
reasonable best efforts to complete any works council, economic committee or
union process required for the transfer of the Pharmaceutical Business in any
such jurisdiction.



 

66 (e) For the purposes of the representations and warranties of PandG, the parties
shall deem the Pharmaceutical Business to have been transferred in its
entirety at Closing and that the conditions noted in clause (a) and (b) of
this Section 5.22 had been satisfied as of Closing.

SECTION 5.23. _Italian Pharmaceuticals Business_. At Closing, Purchaser and
PandG shall cause their respective relevant Affiliates to enter into a
concession sale agreement ("contratto di concessione di vendita") (the "
_Italian Concession Agreement_ ") on customary terms reasonably acceptable to
PandG and Purchaser and acceptable to the Italian Drug Agency ( _Agenzia
Italiana del Farmaco - AIFA_ ), allowing Purchaser or its Affiliate to use
PandGs market authorizations relating to that portion of the Pharmaceuticals
Business operated by PandG and its Affiliates in Italy until the valid transfer
of such market authorizations to Purchaser or its Affiliate has occurred.

SECTION 5.24. _Norwich Lease_. In connection with a disposition by PandG of its
Norwich, New York technical center, Woods Corner site (the " _Norwich
Facility_ ") prior to Closing, PandG or its Affiliates may enter into a lease
with the purchaser of the Norwich Facility with respect to certain space
currently occupied by the Pharmaceuticals Business Employees employed at the
Norwich Facility. PandG shall negotiate the terms of such lease with the
purchaser of the Norwich Facility in good faith, after consultation
with Purchaser (which shall include Purchasers consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld) with respect to the terms and conditions of such
lease). Any lease entered into with the prior consent of Purchaser between PandG
or its Affiliates and the purchaser of the Norwich Facility prior to Closing
will be deemed to be a Pharmaceuticals Business Asset for purposes of this
Agreement and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
PandG shall be entitled to update Schedule 1.01(d)(vi) to reflect the portion
of the Norwich Facility subjected to such lease, which update shall be
considered for all purposes of this Agreement.

SECTION 5.25. _Works Council Cooperation_. (a) PandG and Purchaser shall each
provide, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to provide, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause each of their respective
representatives including legal, human resources and regulatory to provide,
all cooperation reasonably requested by the other party in connection with all
notifications and consultation and other processes necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include any
required notifications and consultation and other processes with respect to
the PandG Euro Forum and any works council, economic committee, union or similar
body as required to either (i) obtain an opinion or acknowledgment from any
works council, economic committee, union or similar body or (ii) establish
that the parties are permitted to effect the Closing without such opinion or
acknowledgment. Such cooperation shall include the provision of any
information required by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract, or as
reasonably requested by the other party. Purchaser shall make available its
representatives at such times and in such places as PandG may reasonably
request for purposes of discussions with representatives of any such works
council, economic committee, union or similar body.

(b) Following the Closing, PandG and Purchaser shall continue the joint
establishment currently maintained by PandG for its German Local Pharmaceutical
Business.

(c) Immediately after the date of this Agreement, PandG, in consultation with
Purchaser, will commence the negotiations with the German works council for
the separation of  



 

67  the German Local Pharmaceutical Business from the joint establishment,
although PandG makes no representation or warranty as to its ability to achieve
the separation on any specific time frame or without condition, and PandG and
Purchaser shall cause their respective German Affiliates to enter into an
arrangement described on, and in accordance with, Schedule 5.25(c).

(d) During the period of the continuation of the joint establishment after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall have full financial responsibility for
all Continuing Employees (and all employees hired by, or transferred into,
the Pharmaceutical Business in Germany after the Closing Date) as and to the
extent set forth in this Agreement. The arrangements under Schedule 5.25(c)
shall have no effect on the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to
Section 2.02.

ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

SECTION 6.01.  _Identification of Employees; Continuity of Employment_. (a)
Not more than 20 and not less than 10 days prior to the Closing, PandG shall
provide Purchaser with updated versions of Schedule 5.09(c) ( _Retained
Employees_ ), Schedule 3.17(c) ( _Core In-Scope Employees_ ) and Schedule
3.17(d) ( _Double-Choice Employees_ ), reflecting only such changes from the
versions of such Schedules attached to this Agreement as of the date hereof as
are contemplated by the principles set forth on Schedule 6.01(a) and
highlighting such changes.

(b) PandG and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that it is in their mutual
best interest for there to be continuity of employment by the Transferred
Subsidiaries (or Purchaser or its Affiliates) following the Closing Date with
respect to (i) each Core In-Scope Employee, (ii) each Double-Choice Employee
that receives and accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser as of the
Closing, and (iii) any employee of PandG and its Affiliates whose employment is
required pursuant to applicable Law to transfer to Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries) in connection with the sale of the
Pharmaceuticals Business (other than any employee whose employment with the
PandG or its Affiliates terminated prior to the Closing) (collectively, "
_Article 6 Employees_ "). Nothing herein shall require the Purchaser to make
an offer of employment to any Double-Choice Employee. PandG shall take all
actions necessary to provide that as of the Closing Date (i) no Transferred
Subsidiary shall employ or shall have any liability or obligation to employ
any individual who is not an Article 6 Employee and (ii) neither Purchaser nor
any Purchaser Affiliate shall have any obligation to employ any such employee
and PandG and its Affiliates shall assume all liability with respect to such
actions. Each Article 6 Employee who continues employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) (the applicable
entity, the " _Employing Entity_ ") immediately following the Closing is
referred to herein as a " _Continuing Employee_ ". Each Continuing Employee
who is based in the United States is referred to as a " _US Continuing
Employee_ ", and each Continuing Employee who is based outside of the United
States is referred to as a " _Non-US Continuing Employee_ ". With respect to
any Core In-Scope Employee or Double-Choice Employee located outside North
America who is not expected to be employed by a Transferred Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing Date, PandG agrees to cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries to cooperate with Purchaser to permit such employee to be offered
employment with an appropriate Transferred Subsidiary  



 

68  as of the Closing Date as reasonably requested by Purchaser and to the
extent practicable. Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation or
guarantee by PandG that some or all of the Article 6 Employees will accept an
offer of employment with Purchaser or one of Purchasers Affiliates or
continue in employment with Purchaser or one of Purchasers Affiliates for any
period of time following the Closing. PandG shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, and shall direct its and their respective officers, agents
and representatives not to, discourage any Core In-Scope Employee from
accepting or continuing employment with the Pharmaceuticals Business
following the Closing either by facilitating alternative employment or
otherwise and PandG shall cooperate with Purchaser to provide Purchaser with an
opportunity to present its terms and conditions of employment to the Article
6 Employees. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) certain of the Article
6 Employees may be eligible for retirement or "special separation" benefits
identified on Section 6.01(b) of the PandG Disclosure Letter from PandG as of the
Closing under the terms and conditions of PandGs general employment policies;
(ii) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement such
employees may retire from PandG or may receive "special separation" benefits
from PandG as of the Closing under such policies; (iii) Purchasers obligations
set forth in this Article VI with respect to the employment of the Article 6
Employees from and after the Closing shall not be affected by any retirement
or "special separation" of such employees from PandG and its Affiliates; (iv)
any such Article 6 Employee that accepts and continues employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Closing will be deemed to be a
Continuing Employee for purposes of this Agreement; and (v) any retirement or
"special separation" benefits shall not be taken into consideration for
purposes of comparability under Section 6.02. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, to the extent that it can be accommodated in accordance with
applicable Law, any Core In-Scope Employee who is not actively at work as of
the Closing Date due to a leave of absence, disability or sick leave (in each
case, reasonably expected to last for more than two weeks following the
Closing), shall remain an employee of PandG and its Affiliates and shall not
transfer employment to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including for these
purposes any Transferred Subsidiary) until such time as such employee is able
to return to active work status (each, a " _Delayed Transfer Employee_ ").
Each such Delayed Transfer Employee shall not be considered a Continuing
Employee unless and until such employee returns to actively at work status
with Purchaser or its Affiliates prior to the second anniversary of the
Closing. With respect to each such employee, any references to the termination
of any employment-related obligations of PandG or any of its Affiliates and the
assumption or commencement of employment-related obligations by Purchaser and
its Affiliates as of the Closing Date shall be deemed to apply instead as of
the date such employee returns to actively at work status with Purchaser or
its Affiliates. With respect to any Core In-Scope Employee who is working in
any country pursuant to a local visa or similar authorization as of Closing,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) Purchaser and PandG shall use
their reasonable best efforts to allow such employee to transfer to an
Affiliate of Purchaser in such country as of Closing and (ii) to the extent
such measures are not completed as of Closing, such employee shall be
treated as a Delayed Transfer Employee. In addition, PandG and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to identify and
effect the transfer to Purchaser of any individuals retained as independent
contractors whose employment is required to transfer to Purchaser, a
Purchasing Affiliate or a Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing pursuant to
applicable Law.



 

69 SECTION 6.02. _Terms of Employment_.

(a) _Employment Position_. As of the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
one of Purchasers Affiliates to, provide to each Continuing Employee
employment in a position at least comparable to that held by such Continuing
Employee immediately before the Closing on the terms set forth on Schedule
6.02(a).

(b) _Compensation_. The (" _Continuation Period_ ") for each Continuing
Employee means the two-year period that begins as of the Closing or such
shorter period as such Continuing Employee shall remain an employee of an
Employing Entity following the Closing. Purchaser shall provide each
Continuing Employee with compensation on the terms set forth on Schedule
6.02(b).

(c) _Severance_. With respect to each Continuing Employee, other than a
Continuing Employee who is a party to an individual severance agreement,
who incurs a Qualifying Termination (as defined on Schedule 6.02(c)) during
the two-year period that begins as of the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause one of Purchasers Affiliates to, provide such employee with the
severance payments and benefits under the applicable formula set forth in
Section 6.02(c) of the PandG Disclosure Letter for employees based in the
relevant jurisdiction.

(d) _Other Benefits_. During the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall provide
each Continuing Employee with other employee benefits (of a type not addressed
above) that are comparable in the aggregate to the benefits offered to such
Continuing Employee by PandG as of the date hereof.

(e) _Welfare Plans_. Purchaser shall cause each benefit plan of Purchaser and
its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee participates that is a medical
benefit plan (collectively, " _Purchaser s Medical Plans_") to (1) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees, other than limitations that were in effect with respect
to such employees as of the Closing Date under the corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan, (2) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the
deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums or co-payments under a corresponding Purchaser Medical Plan during
the same plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses were made, and
(3) with respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Continuing Employee following the Closing Date to the extent such employee had
satisfied any similar limitation under the corresponding Employee Benefit
Plan.

(f) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Purchaser or one of Purchasers
Affiliates shall cover each US Continuing Employee who has elected to
participate in a flexible spending account plan maintained by PandG or any of
its Affiliates (" _P andGs FSA_") under a flexible spending account plan
maintained by Purchaser or one of Purchasers Affiliates (" _Purchaser s
FSA_") at the same level of coverage provided under PandGs FSA. Each US
Continuing Employee shall be treated as if his participation in Purchasers
FSA had been continuous from the beginning of the plan year under PandGs FSA
in which the Closing occurs and each existing salary reduction election shall
be taken into account for the remainder of the plan year under  



 

70  Purchasers FSA in which the Closing occurs, as if made under Purchasers
FSA. Purchasers FSA shall provide reimbursement for medical care expenses
and dependent care expenses incurred by US Continuing Employees at any time
during the plan year under PandGs FSA in which the Closing occurs (including
claims incurred before the Closing), up to the amount of such US
Continuing Employees elections and reduced by amounts previously reimbursed
by PandGs FSA. Within 30 days following the Closing date, PandG shall (i) provide
to Purchaser accounting of the amounts elected, deducted and paid in respect
of claims under PandGs FSA in respect of the US Continuing Employees during
the plan year in which the Closing occurs and before the Closing and (ii) pay
to Purchaser the net amount, if any, of the excess of the aggregate amount
deducted over the aggregate amount paid in respect of claims under PandGs FSA
in respect of the US Continuing Employees during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs.

(g) _Earned Vacation_. Purchaser and Purchasers Affiliates shall credit each
Continuing Employee the amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation,
personal hours or days earned and sick leave (the " _Transferred Leave_ ")
applicable to such Continuing Employee as of the Closing and PandG shall provide
to Purchaser as of the Closing Date a schedule indicating for each Continuing
Employee the type and number of days of Transferred Leave. Purchaser and
Purchasers Affiliates shall ensure that such Transferred Leave is not subject
to forfeiture to the same extent not subject to forfeiture under the PandG
Vacation Policy and that such Transferred Leave does not count toward any
maximum accrual amount under any plan, program or policy maintained by
Purchaser or one of Purchasers Affiliates for the purpose of providing
vacation, personal days or hours or sick leave.

(h) _Expatriate Packages; Localization Packages_. With respect to Continuing
Employees who, as of the Closing, receive an Expatriate Package, Purchaser
will maintain a comparable Expatriate Package for each such Continuing
Employee unless and until such Continuing Employee returns to his or her home
country and will pay the costs of such repatriation to the same extent and on
the same terms as provided for in PandGs or its Affiliates policies and
practices, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing. With respect to
Continuing Employees who, immediately prior to the Closing, have been
localized other than in their original home country and receive specific
benefits from PandG or its Affiliates relating to their localized status (a "
_Localization Package_ " and each such Continuing Employee, a " _Localized
Employee_ "), Purchaser will maintain a comparable Localization Package for
each such Localized Employee unless and until his or her employment
terminates.

(i) _International Retirement Arrangements_. Effective as of the Closing Date
each international retirement arrangement (a "IRA") for any Continuing
Employee shall be terminated and PandG shall be obligated to make a
cash payment to each such Continuing Employee in an amount determined in
accordance with the terms of the applicable IRA and shall take all other
actions that may be necessary in connection with such termination and
Purchaser shall not assume any liabilities in respect of such IRAs.

(j) _Post-Continuation Period Benefits_. Following the Continuation Period,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of Purchasers Affiliates to, provide to
each Continuing Employee then continuing in employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates employment on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the
terms of employment of similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates.



 

71 (k) _Purchaser Terms and Benefits_. For each Continuing Employee, the terms of
Schedule 6.02(k) shall apply.

(l) _Special Rule for Non-US Employees_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
terms of Schedule 6.02(l) shall apply to all Non-US Continuing Employees.

SECTION 6.03. _Bonuses and Incentives_. PandG will retain all obligations to the
Article 6 Employees, including Continuing Employees, with respect to the
bonuses and incentives under PandGs Short Term Achievement Reward bonus program
(and any other cash or similar incentive program) in which the Continuing
Employees participate for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs that
are attributable to the period prior to the Closing. PandG shall be responsible
for its pro-rata share (determined by dividing the number of days of the
relevant measurement period occurring prior to and including the Closing Date
by the total number of days of such measurement period) of any "13th-month,"
"jubilee" or anniversary, or similar bonus to which any Continuing Employee is
entitled for service during a measurement period that begins prior to the
Closing and ends following the Closing (and within one year following the
Closing in the case of any "jubilee" or anniversary bonus), and Purchaser
shall be responsible for the remainder of such bonus.

SECTION 6.04. _Credit for Service with P andG_. Where applicable, Purchaser and
Purchasers Affiliates shall provide credit for each Continuing Employees
length of service with PandG and its Affiliates for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under each plan, program, policy, or
arrangement of Purchaser and Purchasers Affiliates to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of
PandG or any of its Affiliates; provided that such prior service credit shall
not be required to the extent that it results in a duplication of benefits.

SECTION 6.05. _P andG Non-US Pension Plans; UK Early Retirement Plan_.

(a) _French (Retirement Indemnity Plan), German, Italian and Swiss Pension
Plans_.

(i) Purchaser shall assume, and shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of
Purchaser to, pay, perform and discharge all obligations for benefits accrued
by the Non-US Continuing Employees under the plans set forth in Section
6.05(a)(i) of the PandG Disclosure Letter (the " _P andG Section 6.05(a) Plans_").
Purchaser and PandG agree that from and after the Closing, PandG and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall have no further
liability in respect of the PandG Section 6.05(a) Plans for the payment of
pension benefits or post employment medical benefits to any Non-US Continuing
Employee or dependent thereof.

(ii) Not less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing, PandG shall deliver
to Purchaser a good faith estimate prepared by a qualified actuary in the
relevant jurisdiction of the applicable Actuarial Liability as of the Closing
Date with respect to each of the PandG Section 6.05(a) Plans, together with
copies of work papers and other documents reasonably sufficient to support
the calculation of such estimate. Such estimates shall be prepared using the
actuarial assumptions set forth in Section 6.05(a)(ii) of the PandG Disclosure
Letter. At the Closing, in accordance with the terms of each PandG  



 

72  Section 6.05(a) Plan, PandG shall cause a transfer of cash equal to the
estimated Actuarial Liability referred to above (or if applicable Law or
the terms of such plan specify the amount thereof to be transferred, such
amount, together with cash representing any deficiency between the value of
such transfer and the Actuarial Liability referred to above) to be made from
or in respect of the applicable PandG Section 6.05(a) Plan (or from PandG
directly) to a corresponding pension plan maintained by Purchaser.

(iii) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, PandG shall deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting forth a detailed calculation and breakdown prepared by a
qualified actuary in the relevant jurisdiction of the applicable
Actuarial Liability with respect to each of the PandG Section 6.05(a) Plans
(the " _Pensions Statement_ "). Unless Purchaser notifies PandG in writing
within 30 days after PandGs delivery of the Pensions Statement of
any objection to the computation of the Actuarial Liability with respect to
any PandG Section 6.05(a) Plan, the Pensions Statement shall become final and
binding. Any such notice of objection shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted and only include disagreements based
on the calculation of the applicable Actuarial Liability not being in
accordance with standard actuarial practice and the actuarial assumptions set
forth in Section 6.05(a)(ii) of the PandG Disclosure Letter.

(iv) If Purchaser provides a notice of objection to PandG pursuant to Section
6.05(a)(iii) within such 30-day period, Purchaser and PandG shall, during the
30-day period following PandGs receipt of such notice of objection, attempt in
good faith to resolve Purchasers objections. If PandG and Purchaser are able
to resolve all or a portion of such objections within such 30-day period, they
shall reduce such resolution to writing and the matters so agreed upon shall
be final and binding on PandG and Purchaser. If PandG and Purchaser are unable to
resolve all such objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining
in dispute shall be submitted to an actuarial firm mutually agreed upon by
Purchaser and PandG and, if PandG and Purchaser are unable to so agree within 10
days after the end of such 30-day period, then PandG and Purchaser shall each
select such a firm and such firms shall jointly select a third nationally
recognized firm to resolve the disputed matters (such selected firm being
the " _Independent Actuarial Expert_ "), together with the parties written
submissions in support of their respective positions. The parties shall
instruct the Independent Actuarial Expert to render its reasoned written
decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after
its selection. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Actuarial
Expert (A) shall be based solely on the written submissions provided by the
parties; (B) shall not provide for a resolution of any disputed item that is
more favorable to PandG than the determination of such item in the Pensions
Statement or more favorable to Purchaser than the determination of such item
in the notice of disagreement submitted pursuant to Section 6.05(a)(iii); and
(C) shall be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent
Actuarial Expert shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. The fees and expenses of the Independent Actuarial
Expert shall be borne equally by Purchaser and PandG. PandG shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective service providers to provide to Purchaser
promptly upon request any reasonably requested information and materials
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Purchaser to calculate the
Actuarial Liability, to understand the calculations performed by PandGs
actuary and to assess the assets to be transferred to Purchasers plans in
respect of any Liabilities under the PandG Section 6.05(a) Plans to be assumed
by Purchaser.



 

73 (v) Within 10 days after the Actuarial Liability has been finally determined
with respect to each of the PandG Section 6.05(a) Plans, (i) if the sum of such
Actuarial Liability exceeds the aggregate amount transferred to Purchasers
plans pursuant to Section 6.05(a)(ii), PandG shall pay to Purchaser the amount
of such excess, and (ii) if the aggregate amount transferred to Purchasers
plans pursuant to Section 6.05(a)(ii) exceeds the sum of such Actuarial
Liability, Purchaser shall pay to PandG such excess. Any payment hereunder shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Purchaser or PandG, as the case may be.

(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if under applicable Law (including,
without limitation, Swiss Law relating to partial liquidation rules), or by
the applicable trustee of any Section 6.05(a) Plan, Continuing Employees are
required to continue to accrue benefits under a PandG Section 6.05(a) Plan after
the Closing or the transfer of assets described above is required to be made
in assets other than cash or other procedures contrary to the
above procedures are required to be followed, then the parties shall
cooperate to provide for the transfer of amounts equal to the applicable
Actuarial Liability inclusive of all benefit obligations assumed by Purchaser
under the relevant PandG Section 6.05(a) Plan, to identify and agree the assets
to be transferred and to follow such other procedures as may be required under
Law.

(b) _Pension Plans (other than French (Retirement Indemnity), German, Italian
and Swiss Plans)_.

(i) No assets or liabilities with respect to the Continuing Employees shall
be transferred as a result of this Agreement from any pension plan or post-
retirement health or welfare plan or arrangement set forth in Section 6.05(b)
of the PandG Disclosure Letter or any other pension or post-retirement health
or welfare plan or arrangement (other than the PandG Section 6.05(a) Plans and
the UK Early Retirement Plan) (the " _P andG Section 6.05(b) Plans_") to
any plan or arrangement established by Purchaser or any of Purchasers
Affiliates, and, as of the Closing, the Continuing Employees participating in
the PandG Section 6.05(b) Plans shall cease to accrue additional benefits under
the PandG Section 6.05(b) Plans (to the extent such accruals have not already
ceased). Vested benefits accrued by the Continuing Employees under the PandG
Section 6.05(b) Plans through the Closing shall be payable to such Continuing
Employees pursuant to the terms of, and at the time and in the amounts
provided under, the PandG Section 6.05(b) Plans, as may be amended from time to
time.

(c) _UK Pension and Early Retirement Benefit_.

(i) Purchaser shall assume, and shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of
Purchaser to, pay, perform and discharge all obligations for benefits accrued
by the Non-US Continuing Employees under the provisions of the Early
Retirement Benefit component of the PandG Pension Fund set forth in Section
6.05(c)(i) of the PandG Disclosure Letter (the " _UK Early Retirement
Provisions_ "). Purchaser and PandG agree that from and after  



 

74  the Closing, PandG and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) shall have no further liability in respect of the UK Early
Retirement Provisions for the payment of benefits to any Non-US Continuing
Employee or dependant thereof.

(ii) Not less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing, PandG shall deliver
to Purchaser a good faith estimate prepared by a qualified actuary in the
United Kingdom of the applicable UK Early Retirement Liability with respect to
the UK Early Retirement Provisions, together with copies of work papers and
other documents reasonably sufficient to support the calculation of such
estimate. Such estimate shall be prepared using the actuarial assumptions set
forth in Section 6.05(c)(ii) of the PandG Disclosure Letter. At the Closing, an
amount equal to the sum of such estimates shall be offset against the Purchase
Price to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i)(B). Within 45
days after the Closing Date, PandG shall deliver to Purchaser a statement
setting forth a detailed calculation and breakdown prepared by a qualified
actuary in the United Kingdom of the applicable UK Early Retirement Liability
with respect to the UK Early Retirement Provisions. Any objections by
Purchaser to the actuarial estimate of the UK Early Retirement Liability with
respect to the UK Early Retirement Provisions shall be asserted and resolved
through the provisions of Section 6.05(a) applicable to disputes
and resolution of disputes with respect to the Pensions Statement.

(iii) PandG shall procure that the Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals UK Limited
(the " _UK Transferred Subsidiary_ ") shall cease to be a participating
employer of (a) each of the UK pension schemes sponsored or contributed to by
PandG or any PandG Affiliate (each a " _UK Scheme_ ") with effect on and from
Closing and PandG shall pay any Liability, contribution or other payment (a)
arising under section 75 or 75A Pensions Act 1995 with respect to any UK
Scheme, (b) arising on or after the Closing Date under sections 38 to 51
Pensions Act 2004 with respect to any UK Scheme or (c) otherwise relating to
any obligation to provide financial support for any Person which contributes
to any UK Scheme pursuant to a direction made under section 43 Pensions Act
2004.

SECTION 6.06. _Severance Agreements_. With respect to a Continuing Employee
who is a party to an individual severance agreement, Purchaser shall assume
such agreement and provide such employee with the severance payments and
benefits to which such employee would be entitled under the terms of his or
her severance agreement, or if more favorable, the severance payments
provided by Purchaser to similarly situated employees under any broad-based
severance plans or policies of Purchaser or its Affiliates. Purchaser and the
Employing Entity may require, as a condition to the payment of any severance
due hereunder to any Continuing Employee, that such Continuing Employee
provide a general waiver and release of claims in a form substantially similar
to the form used for similarly situated Purchaser employees; _provided_
, that nothing herein shall preclude such Continuing Employee from becoming
employed by PandG and its Affiliates and such release shall also include a
provision for a release of claims for the benefit of PandG and its Affiliates.

SECTION 6.07. _COBRA and HIPAA; Workers  Compensation_. Effective as of the
Closing, Purchaser and Purchasers Affiliates shall assume and be responsible
for (i) all Liabilities with respect to US Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, in respect of health insurance under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as  



 

75  amended, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
Sections 601 et seq. and Sections 701 et seq. of ERISA, Section 4980B
and Sections 9801 et seq. of the Code and applicable state or similar laws;
and (ii) subject to Section 6.09(d)(iii) to the extent applicable, all
workers compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of the US Continuing
Employees. 

SECTION 6.08. _WARN Act_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause Purchasers
Affiliates to, provide any required notice under the WARN Act, and any
similar federal, state or local law or regulation, and to otherwise comply
with the WARN Act and any such other similar law or regulation with respect to
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group
termination or similar event affecting Continuing Employees (including as a
result of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and
occurring from and after the Closing. Purchaser shall not, and shall
not permit any of Purchasers Affiliates to, take any action on or after the
Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment of any employees
by PandG or PandGs Affiliates occurring prior to the Closing to constitute
a "plant closing," "mass layoff" or group termination or similar event under
the WARN Act or any similar federal, state, local or foreign law or
regulation, or to create any liability or penalty to PandG or any of its
Affiliates for any employment terminations under applicable Law. PandG shall
notify Purchaser of any layoffs of any employees of the Pharmaceuticals
Business or any Transferred Subsidiary that occur during the 90-day period
prior to the Closing.

 

SECTION 6.09. _Administration, Employee Communications, Cooperation_. (a)
Following the date of this Agreement, PandG and Purchaser (and their
Affiliates) shall reasonably cooperate and use good faith efforts in all
matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Article VI, including, (i) cooperating and providing each other with all
necessary and reasonable assistance and information to ensure that any works
councils or committees, trade unions and/or employee representatives
applicable to the Non-US Continuing Employees are provided with the
information required in order for proper consultation to take place and (ii)
exchanging information and data relating to workers compensation, employee
benefits and employee benefit plan coverages (except to the extent prohibited
by applicable Law), making any and all required filings and notices, making
any and all required communications with Article VI Employees and obtaining
any governmental approvals required hereunder.

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, any communications between
Purchaser and any employees of PandG and its Affiliates regarding terms of
employment, employee benefits or otherwise regarding employment with
Purchaser shall be conducted through processes approved by PandG, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld. Such processes shall provide adequate access
to the Article 6 Employees and allow all reasonable means of communication
with such employees by Purchaser and its Affiliates.

(c) Without limiting Purchasers obligations under this Article VI with
respect to the Continuing Employees, this Article VI shall not (i) be treated
as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend any employee benefit plan in which
Purchasers employees participate, or (ii) prohibit Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) from amending any
employee benefit plan in which Purchasers employees participate.



 

76 (d) PandG shall retain and be responsible for all Liabilities to the extent
relating to (i) any Pharmaceuticals Business Employee who does not become a
Continuing Employee for any reason (other than a failure of Purchaser or its
Affiliates to fulfill their obligations under this Article VI) (including,
without limitation, any Pharmaceuticals Business Employee who has terminated
employment with PandG and its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing), (ii)
except as explicitly provided in this Article VI or non material Employee
Benefit Plans sponsored or maintained by the Transferred Subsidiaries, any
Employee Benefit Plan (including each Section 3.18(c) Plan and including any
employers social security (or similar) contributions or costs relating to
participation in such plans by the Pharmaceuticals Business Employees) and
(iii) claims for benefits or recovery with respect to claims incurred on or
prior to the Closing Date by any Continuing Employee under any employee
benefit plan or third-party insurance arrangement, to the extent such
benefit plan or third-party insurance arrangement provides for claims payment
or recovery on an as incurred basis (including, without limitation, claims
under medical, life insurance and disability benefit plans and policies,
workers compensation claims and similar claims) (collectively, the "
_Specified Employee Liabilities_ ").

(e) PandG shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Purchaser in a
timely manner with sufficient information to enable the Purchaser or the
relevant member of the Purchasers group to fulfill its obligations to the
revenue authorities in any jurisdiction in relation to the participation of
any of the Continuing Employee in any Employee Benefit Plan.

ARTICLE VII

CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

SECTION 7.01.  _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation_. The obligations of
Purchaser and PandG to consummate the Closing are subject to the satisfaction
(or waiver by Purchaser and PandG) at or prior to the Closing of the following
conditions: 

(a) _Governmental Approvals_. Any applicable waiting periods, and any required
consents, under applicable Antitrust Laws set forth on Schedule 7.01(a) shall
have expired, been terminated or been obtained, as applicable.

Section 5.22, the notifications to the PandG Euro Forum, and the works

officer of PandG as to the satisfaction of the foregoing condition. For purposes

delay, impair or increase the costs of the Financing; _provided_ , that the
condition set forth in this Section 7.02(d) shall be deemed satisfied at 5:00
p.m., New York time on the fifth calendar day following delivery of the
Audited Financial Statements unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(vi) prior to such time (it being understood that

Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

79 (ii) by either PandG or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other party, if

Purchaser contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by

not be satisfied, and, in the case of both (A) and (B), such breach is
incapable of being cured by the Outside Date;

(iv) by Purchaser, upon written notice to PandG, if (A) there exists a breach of
any representation or warranty of PandG contained in this Agreement such that
the closing condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) would not be satisfied or

p.m. New York time on the fifth calendar day following delivery of the Audited
Financial Statements (it being understood that Purchaser shall be given access
to work papers that the Pharmaceutical Business independent auditors would
customarily provide in transactions of this nature (it being further
understood that such work papers will not include international office work
papers or proprietary information of such independent auditors customarily
excluded)). 

(b) In the event of termination by PandG or Purchaser pursuant to Section
8.01(a), written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated,
without further action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are terminated as provided herein:

(i) to the extent required by the Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause each of its directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives and advisors to, return to PandG all documents and other
material received from PandG or any of its Affiliates or representatives
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof; and



 

80 (ii) all confidential information received by Purchaser, its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors with
respect to the businesses of PandG and its Affiliates (including the
Pharmaceuticals Business) shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and

Section 5.17 (Confidentiality), Article VIII (Termination), Section 10.03
(Expenses), Section 10.09 (Governing Law) and Section 10.10 (Commencement of
Proceedings); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.02
shall be deemed to (i) release any party from any liability for any willful
breach by such party of the terms, conditions, covenants and other provisions
of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.03. _Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by PandG or Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(ii) and all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 (other than (i) the
condition set forth in Section 7.02(e) and (ii) those other conditions that,
by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but, in the case
of clause (ii), which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were
the date of such termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the
date of such termination (such a termination described above, a " _Financing
Condition Termination_ "), then Purchaser shall pay to PandG a termination fee
equal to $93,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by PandG. The
Termination Fee shall be payable within two Business Days after written notice
of such termination in the case of a termination by PandG and concurrently with
such termination in the case of a termination by Purchaser. PandG agrees that
in the event that the Termination Fee is paid to PandG pursuant to this Section
8.03, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the payment
of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of PandG and its
Related Persons against Purchaser or any of its Related Persons for, and in no
event shall PandG or any of its Related Persons seek to recover any other money
damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with
respect to, (A) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Acquisition to be consummated, (B) the termination of this Agreement, (C) any
liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (D) any claims or
actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or
under this Agreement, in each case, with respect to a Financing Condition
Termination and any event related thereto or otherwise in connection with a
breach of this Agreement, and upon payment to PandG of the Termination Fee,
neither Purchaser nor any Related Person of Purchaser shall have further
liability or obligation to PandG or any of its Related Persons relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except
as provided in Section 8.02). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Termination
Fee shall be payable if PandG does not deliver, in advance of the Marketing
Period, the Audited Financial Statements, the Required Interim Financial
Statements or the other information and cooperation required in advance of the
Marketing Period pursuant to Section 5.05(b), or if the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.02(e) to be satisfied is otherwise a result
of PandGs material breach of Section 5.05(b). For purposes of this Section
8.03(a), " _Related Person_ " means, with respect to a party, any former,
current or future, direct or indirect, stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, Representative, Affiliate or assignee of such party, or any
former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, Representative,
Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing.



 

81 (b) If Purchaser shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when required pursuant
to Section 8.03(a) Parent shall reimburse PandG, as applicable, for all
reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by PandG (including
reasonable expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 8.03 from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate prevailing during
such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

SECTION 9.01. _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, PandG shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) and each
of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents
and representatives, successors and assignees (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_
") from and against (x) (i) all Liability for Taxes of the Transferred
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Taxes arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period that are
attributable to taxable income for which a Transferred Subsidiary recognized a
permanent economic benefit (such as, the receipt of cash or the equivalent
thereof) without Tax liability in a Pre-Closing Tax Period), (ii) all
Liability of the Transferred Subsidiaries for Taxes of PandG or its Affiliates
(other than another Transferred Subsidiary) as a result of the application of
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) all Liability
for Section 338(h)(10) Taxes, (iv) all Liability of Purchaser or the
Transferred Subsidiaries (or any successors thereto) for breach by PandG of any
provision in Section 3.19 or Section 5.14, (v) all Liability for Taxes of PandG
or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), other than Taxes
described in Section 9.01(b), and (vi) all Liability for Transfer Taxes for
which PandG is liable pursuant to Section 5.14(l) (provided, however, that PandG
shall have no liability under this Section 9.01 for the German tax claim
described in Section 3.19(b) of the PandG Disclosure Letter to the extent such
liability is satisfied in the manner described in Schedule 5.07(b))
(collectively, " _Indemnified Taxes_ ") and (y) all losses, damages,
liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable third-party legal fees and
expenses in connection with any audit, investigation, administrative
proceeding or prosecution whether involving a third party claim or other
action or a claim solely between the parties hereto) related to Indemnified
Taxes (together with Indemnified Taxes, " _Tax Losses_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, PandG shall not indemnify and hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnitee
from any Tax Losses to the extent directly attributable to a breach by
Purchaser of Section 5.14(c) hereof or of any other obligation under this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 9.01 shall be
the exclusive provision relating to indemnification for Liabilities relating
to Taxes or for any breach of the representations and warranties of PandG
contained in Section 3.19 and, for the avoidance of doubt, Sections 9.05, 9.06
and 9.10 shall not apply for purposes of this Section 9.01. 



 

82 (b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Transferred Subsidiaries,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless PandG and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives, successors and assignees (the " _P
andG Indemnitees_") from and against (x)(i) all Liability for Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all Liability
for Taxes of PandG or its Affiliates (or any successors thereto) resulting from
breach by Purchaser of Section 5.14(a) or Section 5.14(c) or any of its other
covenants or agreements in this Agreement, and (iii) all Liability for
Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is liable pursuant to Section 5.14(l); and
(y) all losses, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable
third-party legal fees and expenses in connection with any audit,
investigation, administrative proceeding or prosecution whether involving a
third party claim or other action or a claim solely between the parties
hereto) related to Taxes described in this Section 9.01(b).

(c) The amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the
Transferred Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
other pass-through entity in which a Transferred Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount
of other Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions
of Section 3.19, Section 5.14 and this Section 9.01 shall survive for the
full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

SECTION 9.02. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

(a) If any party is required to indemnify and hold harmless another party from
and against any Liability for Taxes pursuant to Section 9.01 (the " _Tax
Indemnifying Party_ "), and the applicable indemnified party to this Agreement
(the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") receives a notice of deficiency, proposed
adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or
other claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ") with respect (in whole or in part) to such
Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Tax Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Tax Claim. No failure or delay on the part of
the Tax Indemnified Party to give notice to the Tax Indemnifying Party shall
reduce or otherwise affect the Liabilities of the Tax Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article IX; provided, however, that the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article IX to the extent that such failure or delay shall
have adversely affected the Tax Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against
such Liability or claim for Taxes. 

(b) The Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the applicable audit
or examination and the defense of a Tax Claim involving any Taxes for which
it has an obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 9.01, and the Tax Indemnified Party agrees to, and to cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in pursuing such
contest, including execution of any powers of attorney in favor of the Tax
Indemnifying  



 

83  Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified Party informed of all
material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim and the Tax
Indemnified Party, at its own cost and expense and with its own counsel, shall
have the right to participate in (but not control) the applicable audit or
examination and defense of such Tax Claim.

(c) In no case shall any Tax Indemnified Party settle or otherwise compromise
(or extend the statute of limitations for) any Tax Claim without the Tax
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Neither party shall settle a Tax Claim
relating solely to Income Taxes of the Tax Indemnified Party or any of
its subsidiaries for a Straddle Period without the other partys prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

SECTION 9.03. _Other Indemnification by P andG_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.06 and Section 9.11, from and after the Closing, PandG shall,
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against any
and all losses, damages, liabilities, or expenses (including reasonable third-
party legal fees and expenses in connection with the investigation or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim or any claim solely between the parties
hereto) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee (other than any Loss relating to Taxes or a breach of the
representations and warranties of PandG set forth in Section 3.19, the
exclusive indemnification provisions for which are set forth in Section 9.01),
to the extent arising out of or resulting from any of the following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of PandG contained in this
Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of PandG contained in this
Agreement;

(c) any Specified Indemnified Liability;

(d) 50% of the Losses arising out of or resulting from any Shared Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability; and

(e) 50% of the Losses arising out of or resulting from any Shared Pre-Closing
Proceeding Liability.

SECTION 9.04. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.06, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify
the PandG Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by any PandG Indemnitee (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which
indemnification provisions are set forth in Section 9.01), to the extent
arising out of or resulting from any of the following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement; and



 

84 (c) the failure of Purchaser or its Affiliates to pay, perform or otherwise
discharge when due and payable any Assumed Liability (except to the extent
subject to indemnification by PandG pursuant to Sections 9.03(d) or (e)).

SECTION 9.05. _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives
written notice of the commencement of any Proceeding or the assertion of any
claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment (in each
case other than with respect to Taxes) for which indemnity may be sought
under Section 9.03 or Section 9.04 (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature,
basis for indemnification and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along
with copies of any relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim.
Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice, or provide such
documentation, shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 45 days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to
give notice to assume the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings thereof;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges that the Losses resulting
from such Third Party Claim are within the scope of indemnified Losses subject
to Section 9.03 or 9.04 (any such acknowledgement having no effect on the
application of any other provisions of this Section 9.05(a) that may limit
the Indemnifying Partys liability for such Losses). If notice to the effect
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense,
appeal or settlement proceedings of the Indemnified Party against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to (i) assume the defense, appeal or settlement of any
Third Party Claim if (A) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation; or (B) the Third Party Claim seeks any injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party; or (ii) maintain control of the defense,
appeal or settlement of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party has
failed or is failing to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim. So long
as the Indemnifying Party is entitled to do so and has assumed the defense,
appeal or settlement proceedings of the Third Party Claim in accordance
herewith, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense and participate in the defense, appeal or settlement
proceedings of the Third Party Claim ( _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
the defense of the Third Party Claim or if representation of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create
a conflict of interest (due to one or more legal defenses or counterclaims, a
variable to the Indemnified Party, which are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party or other such conflicts)), (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not (A) admit to any wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates or (B) consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent
such judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or if  



 

85  such judgment or such settlement does not expressly unconditionally release
the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all Liabilities and impose
no ongoing constraint on the Indemnified Party or, if applicable, any real
property with respect to such Third Party Claim, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (it being understood and agreed that the
Indemnified Party shall agree to any such settlement recommended by the
Indemnifying Party for which the Indemnified Partys prior written consent is
not required pursuant to this claim (iii)). The parties shall act in good
faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with
such Third Party Claims. The parties shall also cooperate in any such defense,
appeal or settlement proceedings, and give each other reasonable access, upon
reasonable prior notice during normal business hours, to all information
relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense, appeal or settlement proceedings, such Indemnifying Party shall not
be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying
Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). 

(b) _Other Claims_. In order to assert a claim for indemnification under
Section 9.03 or Section 9.04 (in each case, other than in respect of a Third
Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with
written notice of such claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount
thereof, to the extent known. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to
refer such claim for resolution to the Chief Financial Officer of PandG and the
Chief Financial Officer of Purchaser or (or their designees) by delivering to
the Indemnified Party a written notice of the referral. Following receipt of a
notice of referral, each of the Parties will cause their respective officer
or designee to negotiate in good faith to resolve the Claim. If such officers
or designees are unable to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the date
notice of such claim is provided by the Indemnified Party, then either Party
will have the right to seek to resolve such claim in accordance with the
provisions of Article X. The Parties agree that all discussions, negotiations
and other information exchanged between the Parties during the foregoing
negotiation will be without prejudice to the legal position of a Party in any
subsequent Proceeding.

SECTION 9.06. _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) PandG shall not have any liability under
Section 9.03(a) (other than with respect to a breach of any of the Specified
Representations) unless the aggregate liability for Losses suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnitees thereunder exceeds $23,250,000, and then only to the
extent of such excess; (ii) PandGs aggregate liability under Section 9.03(a)
(other than with respect to a breach of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 3.08, the
first sentence of Section 3.09(a), the first sentence of Section 3.10(d),
3.11(c), 3.20 and 3.21 (the " _Specified Representations_ ")) shall not
exceed $620,000,000; (iii) (A) Purchaser shall not have any liability under
Section 9.04(a) (other than with respect to a breach of any of the Purchaser
Specified Representations) unless the aggregate liability for Losses suffered
by the PandG Indemnitees thereunder exceeds $23,250,000, and then only to the
extent of such excess; (B) Purchasers aggregate liability under Section
9.04(a) (other than with respect to a breach of Sections 4.01 and 4.07 (the "
_Purchaser Specified Representations_ ")) shall not exceed $620,000,000; and
(C) Purchasers aggregate liability under Section 9.04(a) with respect to a
breach of the Purchaser Specified Representations shall not exceed the
Purchase Price; (iv) no party shall have any liability under Section 9.03(a)
or Section 9.04(a) for any Loss arising out of any individual claim (or any
series of claims arising out of substantially the same events, facts or  



 

86  circumstances, which shall be aggregated for purposes of this clause (iv)),
unless such Loss exceeds $100,000, and any Losses that are disregarded
pursuant to this clause (iv) shall not be aggregated for purposes of the
preceding clauses (i) through (iii); (v) PandG shall not have any liability
under Section 9.03(a) for any otherwise indemnifiable Loss to the extent, but
only to the extent, of specific reserves or provisions on the Unaudited
Balance Sheet for the matter giving rise to such Loss; and (vi) no party shall
be liable under Section 9.03 or 9.04 for any Losses to the extent resulting
from the failure of the Purchaser Indemnitees or the PandG Indemnitees, as
applicable, to mitigate such Losses in accordance with applicable Laws. To the
extent that any Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of a
breach of PandGs representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.20, are
capable of mitigation through the conveyance to Purchaser or the applicable
Purchaser Indemnitee of the non-transferred Asset giving rise to such Loss,
Purchaser and PandG shall cooperate to effect any arrangement reasonably
proposed by PandG for the transfer to Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Indemnitee of such Asset following notice of the applicable claim.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, other than the representations and
warranties of PandG specifically contained in Article III, there are
no representations or warranties of PandG or any other person either expressed
or implied with respect to the Pharmaceuticals Business, the Pharmaceuticals
Business Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated hereby, individually or collectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser, together with
its advisors, has made its own investigation of the Pharmaceuticals Business,
the Pharmaceuticals Business Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, and is not relying on any implied warranties or upon
any representation or warranty whatsoever as to the prospects (financial or
otherwise), or the viability or likelihood of success, of the Pharmaceuticals
Business, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except as
set forth in Article III, neither PandG nor any of its Affiliates makes any
representations or warranties relating to the maintenance, repair, condition,
design, performance or marketability of any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset,
including merchantability of fitness for a particular purpose. Except as
expressly set forth in any representation or warranty in Article III,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it and the Purchaser Indemnitees shall
have no claim or right to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX (or
otherwise) with respect to any information, documents or materials furnished
to or for Purchaser by PandG, any of its Affiliates, or any of its or their
officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors, including the Confidential
Memorandum regarding the Pharmaceuticals Business provided to Purchaser and
any information, documents or material made available to Purchaser in any
"data room", management presentation or any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 9.07. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be (a) net of
any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies with respect to such Loss (less the cost to collect the proceeds of
such insurance) and (b) reduced to take account of the actual amount by which
the Taxes of the Indemnified Party shall be reduced by such Loss. If any Loss
related to a claim by an Indemnified Party is covered by one or more third
party insurance policies held by the indemnified party, the Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims against the
applicable insurers for coverage of such Loss  



 

87  under such policies. If the Indemnified Party actually receives a full or
partial recovery under such insurance policies following payment of
indemnification by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, then the
Indemnified Party shall refund amounts received from the Indemnifying Party up
to the amount of indemnification actually received from the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such Loss. 

SECTION 9.08. _Exclusivity_. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of a party to this Agreement with respect to any and all
claims relating to this Agreement, the Pharmaceuticals Business, the
Pharmaceuticals Business Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud and except for seeking
specific performance or other equitable relief to require a party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement) shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 5.05(b), Section 5.11 and this Article IX. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement hereby waives, from
and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 5.05(b),
Section 5.11 and this Article IX and other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud and except for seeking specific performance or other
equitable relief to require a party to perform its obligations under this
Agreement) that such party, any Purchaser Indemnitee (in the case of
Purchasers waiver) or any PandG Indemnitee (in the case of PandGs waiver) may
have against the other party or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
directors, officers and employees arising under or based upon any applicable
Laws (including with respect to environmental matters generally, or any
matters under CERCLA specifically) and arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or, in the case of PandGs waiver, arising out of
or based upon its ownership of, or the operation of, the Pharmaceuticals
Business prior to the Closing.

SECTION 9.09. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and PandG agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a final determination (which
shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides
otherwise.

SECTION 9.10. _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of Sections 9.03 and
9.04. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other
than the Specified Representations and the Purchaser Specified
Representations) shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is
18 months following the Closing. The Specified Representations and the
Purchaser Specified Representations shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (or, if there is no applicable statute of
limitations, until the fifth anniversary of the Closing). None of the
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
other than those which by their terms contemplate performance after the
Closing Date and such surviving covenants and agreements shall survive the
Closing only until the expiration of the term of the undertaking set forth in
such agreements and covenants, except that breaches thereof shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (or, if there
is no applicable statute of limitations, until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing). No party shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with
respect to any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the
termination thereof unless a notice of a breach thereof giving rise to a
right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such
indemnity may  



 

88  be sought prior to such termination, in which case the noticed claims
relating to such breach shall survive such termination until they are finally
resolved. Without limiting the foregoing, all covenants and agreements of the
parties are subject to all applicable statutes of limitation, statutes of
repose and other similar defenses provided by law or equity. This Section 9.10
shall not apply to Sections 3.19, 5.14 and 9.01, the survival of which is
governed solely by Section 9.01(d).

SECTION 9.11. _Matters Relating to Environmental Indemnification_. (a) PandG
shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 9.03(a) for any Losses arising from a breach of Section 3.14 or
pursuant to Section 9.03(d) for any Losses arising from Shared Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities (together, the _"Indemnified Environmental Matters_
") to the extent such Losses arise from or are a consequence of (i) the
knowing initiation or undertaking by any Purchaser Indemnitee of activity
primarily for the purpose of identifying, accelerating or increasing the cost
of any Indemnified Environmental Matter, (ii) any disclosure, report or other
communication to any Governmental Entity or third party (other than to PandG or
any of its Affiliates (or their respective agents) or any third parties acting
on behalf of or in concert with any Purchaser Indemnitee) by or on behalf of
any Purchaser Indemnitee relating to any Indemnified Environmental Matters or
(iii) a Phase II or other intrusive investigation, sampling, testing or
monitoring of soil, surface water, groundwater or sediment performed by or on
behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates on or after the Closing, which, in the
case of each of (i), (ii) and (iii) above, is not required by any Law,
Environmental Permit or Governmental Entity or is not reasonably required to
respond to a Third Party Claim (whether made against a PandG Indemnitee or a
Purchaser Indemnitee) or is not initiated or undertaken in good faith to
address conditions that pose an imminent and substantial health risk or
present an imminent and substantial threat to the environment or natural
resources or is not in connection with any expansion, repair in the ordinary
course of business, modification in the ordinary course of business or closure
of any Pharmaceuticals Business Asset; _provided_ once the parties hereto have
acknowledged a matter qualifies for coverage under Section 9.03(a) or Section
9.03(d), the limitations set forth in this Section 9.11(a)(ii) and (iii) shall
not apply to such matter.

(b) In addition to the limitations in Section 9.11(a), PandG shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee for any Losses arising from
an Indemnified Environmental Matter to the extent that such Losses were not
incurred in a _"Commercially Reasonable Manner_ " which shall mean the most
cost-effective and commercially reasonable method for investigation,
remediation, removal, corrective action, containment, monitoring and/or other
response action, as determined from the perspective of a reasonable business
person acting (without regard to the availability of indemnification under
this Article IX) to achieve compliance Environmental Laws, Environmental
Permits or to meet the demands of any relevant Governmental Entity or as
required by any judicial or administrative resolution, order or settlement of
a claim to the extent consistent with the use of the relevant real property as
of the Closing Date (it being understood that Commercially Reasonable Manner
may include, where appropriate, the use of institutional or engineering
controls, deed restrictions, land use restrictions, capping, or monitored
natural attenuation (collectively, " _Institutional Controls_ ")) so long as
such Institutional Controls do not materially limit the use of the relevant
property for activities ongoing as of the Closing, and so long as such
Institutional Controls are acceptable to the Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction over the matter.



 

89 (c) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have the option to retain exclusive
control of the resolution of any Indemnified Environmental Matter, including,
the exclusive control of any investigation, remediation, correction of
noncompliance, contact, meeting and negotiation with any Governmental Entities
and the prosecution, defense and resolution of any remediation activities or
any claim. With respect to any Indemnified Environmental Matter controlled by
Purchaser and its Affiliates, PandG shall have the right to (i) at its sole cost
and expense, retain separate consultants and co-counsel, (ii) receive advance
notice of and participate, at its sole cost and expense, in any material
meetings or material negotiations with any Governmental Entities and (iii) at
its sole cost and expense, review in advance and provide comments on any
material documents proposed to be submitted to Governmental Entities, which
comments will be considered in good faith. All information concerning the
Indemnified Environmental Matters shared between the parties shall be subject
to the confidentiality provisions of Section 5.17(b) as if such provisions
applied to Indemnified Environmental Matters. Except to the extent prohibited
by any applicable Law, if an applicable Law requires PandG or its Affiliates to
disclose any such information, PandG agrees to notify the Purchaser Indemnitees
as soon as possible under the circumstances of such requirement and, to the
extent possible and not inconsistent with its own obligations to comply with
applicable Laws, to give the Purchaser Indemnitees the opportunity to make
such disclosure or to review and comment in advance on the content and timing
of any disclosure PandG proposes to make.

(d) The procedures set forth in this Section 9.11 are in addition to the
procedures set forth elsewhere in Article IX; _provided_ that, with respect
to Indemnified Environmental Matters, to the extent any provision of this
Section 9.11 conflicts with any other provision in Article IX, this Section
9.11 shall govern and control.

SECTION 9.12. _Procedures for Shared Pre-Closing Proceedings_. (a) Purchaser
shall control the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings relating to any
Shared Pre-Closing Proceeding with counsel of its choice and not reasonably
objected to by PandG; _provided_ that to the extent practicable, Purchaser shall
continue to use Fulbright and Jaworski LLP as defense counsel in the defense of
any Shared Pre-Closing Proceeding asserting claims related to osteonecrosis of
the jaw. To the extent Purchaser may do so under the terms of any Contract
relating to the Products, Purchaser shall provide PandG the opportunity
to participate in the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings of any such
Shared Pre-Closing Proceeding, with counsel of PandGs choice at PandGs sole cost
and expense.

(b) PandG shall use its reasonable best efforts to assert any claims for
indemnification of the Shared Pre-Closing Proceeding Liabilities
under applicable insurance policies, and the amounts actually recovered by
PandG under such insurance policies (less the cost to collect the proceeds of
such insurance) will be applied to reduce the total amount of Shared Pre-
Closing Proceeding Liabilities shared between the Parties, or if PandG receives
any such amounts after any Shared Pre-Closing Proceeding Liability has already
been incurred, PandG shall promptly pay to Purchaser 50% of such amounts.
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with PandG and provide to PandG and/or its
insurance carriers information relating to the foregoing insurance claims.
Purchaser acknowledges that PandG and its Affiliates have asserted claims
against such insurance policies for matters unrelated to the Pharmaceuticals
Business, that such policies may contain aggregate coverage limits that may
limit the net recovery under any particular claim, and agrees that PandG shall
not be required to prosecute claims in any particular order or to favor
claims related to the Pharmaceuticals Business over claims that are not so
related.



 

90 (c) The procedures set forth in this Section 9.12 are in addition to the
procedures set forth elsewhere in Article IX; _provided_ that, with respect
to Shared Pre-Closing Proceeding Liabilities, to the extent any provision of
this Section 9.12 conflicts with any other provision in Article IX, this
Section 9.12 shall govern and control.

92 SECTION 10.05. _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall either party be liable for
punitive damages, if any, of the other party, or any consequential damages of
the other party that are not reasonably foreseeable, in each case whether or
not caused by or resulting from the actions of such party or the breach of
its covenants, agreements, representations or warranties hereunder, even if
such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Section 10.05 shall preclude any recovery by

Schedules annexed hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Transaction
Documents constitute the entire understanding between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all other
understandings and negotiations with respect thereto. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits), on the one hand, and the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement or the Transaction Documents (including the schedules and exhibits
thereto), on the other hand, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

SECTION 10.08.  _Severability_. In the event that any provision contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective as to
such jurisdiction to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions
hereof or affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.09. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes arising under

federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court.
The providers of the Purchasers Financing are third party beneficiaries of

fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,

enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 10.12.

SECTION 10.13. _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified, superseded or canceled and any of the terms,
covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived
only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto or, in the case
of a waiver, by or on behalf of the party waiving compliance. No course of
dealing between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any
provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.14. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity.
