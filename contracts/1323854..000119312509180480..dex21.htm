any Transferred Subsidiary) until such time as such employee is able to return to active work status (each, a &#147;<I>Delayed Transfer Employee</I>&#148;). Each such Delayed Transfer Employee shall not be considered a Continuing Employee unless and

P&amp;G or any of its Affiliates and the assumption or commencement of employment-related obligations by Purchaser and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date shall be deemed to apply instead as of the date such employee returns to actively at work
