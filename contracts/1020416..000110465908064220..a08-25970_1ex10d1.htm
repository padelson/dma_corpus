Escrow Agreement, which shall contain substantially the same payment

### 

  

### 3.5.2 In the event that the Purchaser shall have delivered a Notice of
Claim to the Seller Representatives, the Contributing Sellers and the Escrow
Agent before the expiration of the Escrow Period, the following procedure
shall apply:

  

### 

  

#### (a) If none of the Seller Representatives contest such Notice of Claim
by giving the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent a written counter notice ("
**Counter Notice** ") within twenty (20) Business Days after the delivery of
the Notice of Claim (the " **Dispute Period** "), the Escrow Agent shall,
without the need for any further action by any Seller Representative or the
Purchaser, release the amount of the Claim set forth in the Notice of
Claim (an " **Agreed Claim** "), and any accrued interest thereof, to the
Purchaser within three (3) Business Days after the expiration of the Dispute
Period with respect to such Claim.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) If a Counter Notice is delivered by any Seller Representative with
respect to a Claim pending resolution of the dispute (a " **Disputed Claim**
"), the Escrow Agent shall make payment with respect to a Disputed Claim only
in accordance with (i) the joint written instructions of the Purchaser and at
least three (3) Seller Representatives, (ii) an arbitral award or (iii) a
final court order of competent jurisdiction, which payment of such Claim (a "
**Settled Claim** ") and any accrued interest thereof shall be made within
three (3) Business Days from the date the Escrow Agent receives the joint
written instructions of the Purchaser and at least three (3) Seller
Representatives or, as the case may be, such arbitral award or final court
order regarding such Settled Claim.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Upon delivery by any Seller Representative of a Counter Notice, the
parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputed Claim by holding good faith
discussions between at least three (3) Seller Representatives and the duly
authorized representative(s) of the Purchaser. If the Disputed Claim is
not resolved within twenty (20) Business Days after the delivery of the
Counter Notice pursuant to Clause 3.5.2(a) or such other date as may be
agreed between at least three (3) Seller Representatives and the Purchaser
in writing, any Seller Representative or the Purchaser may refer the
Disputed Claim to arbitration in accordance with Clause 23.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
liability of each Seller for a Claim under Clause 8 shall be subject to the
limitations on liability set forth in Clauses 8.1.5 and 8.1.6 and limited to
the amount remaining in the Escrow Account and any accrued interest thereof
that has not yet been released to the Contributing Sellers or the Purchaser,
as the case may be, pursuant to this Clause 3.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Notwithstanding Clause 3.3 or any other provision to the contrary in
this Agreement, each Contributing Seller agrees that the Purchaser shall be
entitled to apply the Escrow Amount (and any accrued interest thereof)
towards the satisfaction of any Agreed Claim or Settled Claim to the extent
permitted under this Clause 3.5 regardless of whether such Contributing
Seller is liable under the relevant Claim and regardless of the amounts the
Contributing Seller who is liable under the relevant Claim (the " **Liable
Seller** ") has contributed to the Escrow Amount, and each Contributing
Seller shall not raise, and shall procure the Seller Representatives not to
raise, any objection in relation to such application on the ground that such
Contributing Seller is not the Liable Seller and the amount it contributed to
the Escrow Amount may not be used to satisfy the Claim.

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### 3.5.3 All payments with respect to Agreed Claims and Settled Claims under
this Clause 3.5 shall be paid out subject to the provisions of Clause 8.

Period, the Purchaser and a Seller Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to release the amount remaining in the Escrow Amount to each of
the Contributing Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, after having deducted the amounts required to satisfy all Agreed
Claims and Settled Claims (including any accrued interest thereof) which are
outstanding and unpaid, and any Claims in respect of which arbitration has
been commenced in accordance with Clause 23 and the HKIAC Administered
Arbitration Rules at the expiration of the Escrow Period (the " **Arbitrated
Claim Amount** "). **** The Escrow Agent shall release any Arbitrated Claim
Amount (and any accrued interest thereof) in accordance (i) the joint written
instructions of the Purchaser and at least three (3) Seller Representatives,
(ii) an arbitral award or (iii) a final court order of competent
jurisdiction, and such release shall be made within three (3) Business Days
from the date the Escrow Agent receives such joint instructions or, as the
case may be, such arbitral award or final court order regarding such
Arbitrated Claim Amount.

  

### 

  

### 3.5.5 Any interest accruing on the Escrow Account shall be for the benefit
of the Contributing Sellers as set forth in the Escrow Agreement, _provided_
, however, that the Purchaser shall be entitled to interest attributable to
any Agreed Claims or Settled Claims paid to the Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### 3.5.6 All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement which shall be US$10,000 (the " **Escrow Fees** ") shall be borne
equally by the Contributing Sellers on one hand and the Purchaser on the
other hand and shall be paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

  

### 

  

## **3.6** Method of Payment.

  

## ** **

  

All payments under this Clause 3 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated not less than twenty-
four (24) hours by the recipient prior to the time for payment specified
herein.

  



  

## **3.7** Seller Representatives.

Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Contributing Sellers
will be bound by all actions taken or any writing made by at least three (3)
Seller Representatives in connection with the Escrow Agreement, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and Purchaser shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Seller Representatives,
provided that any such action or decision is made by at least three (3)
Seller Representatives. Purchaser shall be entitled to deal exclusively with
the Seller Representatives together, and not individually, as the sole and
exclusive representatives and agents of the Contributing Sellers in respect
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and all matters arising under or
pertaining to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Contributing
Sellers who in the aggregate contributed no less than three-fourths (3/4) of
the Escrow Amount shall have the right to dismiss and appoint Seller
Representatives. The Purchaser shall be notified in writing, signed by such
Contributing Sellers representing no less than three-fourths (3/4) of the
Escrow Amount of any dismissal or appointment of a Seller Representative.
Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in
