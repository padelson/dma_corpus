                                  ARTICLE III

                       CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

     3.01. CONSIDERATION. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Golden West Stock
and subject to Sections 3.04(c) and 3.05, the shares of Golden West Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to
each holder of record of such shares, will be converted into the right to
receive:

               (1) a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Wachovia
          Common Stock (and the requisite number of Wachovia Rights issued and
          attached to such shares under the Wachovia Rights Agreement) equal to
          the product of (i) 1.365 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO"), multiplied by (ii)
          the number of shares of Golden West Common Stock held by such holder
          of record, multiplied by (iii) 77 percent (such product, the "STOCK
          CONSIDERATION"); and

               (2) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) $81.07 (the
          "CASH AMOUNT"), multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Golden West
          Common Stock held by such holder of record, multiplied by (iii) 23
          percent (such product, the "CASH CONSIDERATION" and, together with the
          Stock Consideration, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.01 to the contrary, at the Effective
Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Golden West Common Stock
beneficially owned

                                       11

<PAGE>

by Wachovia (other than shares held in a trust, fiduciary, or nominee capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted) or held in Golden West's treasury
will be canceled and no shares of Wachovia Stock and no Wachovia Rights or other
consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor.

     3.02. CANCELLATION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, the shares of Golden
West Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist. Certificates that represented Golden West
Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of Wachovia Common Stock or cash into which they
were converted pursuant to Section 3.01, and, as contemplated by the Wachovia
Rights Agreement, attached Wachovia Rights.

     3.03. RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDERS; STOCK TRANSFERS. At the Effective Time,
holders of Golden West Common Stock will cease to be, and will have no rights
as, shareholders of Golden West, other than rights to (a) receive any then
unpaid dividend or other distribution with respect to such Golden West Common
Stock having a record date before the Effective Time and (b) receive the Merger
Consideration provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there
will be no transfers of shares of Golden West Common Stock on the stock transfer
books of Golden West or the Surviving Corporation, and shares of Golden West
Common Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason will be
canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Article III.

     3.04. EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As of the Effective Time, Wachovia will deposit
with Wachovia's transfer agent or with a depository or trust institution of
recognized standing selected by Wachovia and reasonably satisfactory to Golden
West (in such capacity, the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Golden West Common Stock ("OLD
CERTIFICATES"), (1) certificates or, at Wachovia's option, evidence of shares in
book entry form, representing the number of shares of Wachovia Common Stock
("NEW CERTIFICATES") issuable to holders of Old Certificates under this Article
III, (2) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Old Certificates
under this Article III and (3) cash payable pursuant to Section 3.05 (the
"EXCHANGE FUND").

          (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Wachovia will send or cause to
     be sent to each person who was a recordholder of Golden West Common Stock
     immediately before the Effective Time transmittal materials, in form
     reasonably acceptable to Golden West, for exchanging Old Certificates. Upon
     surrender of an Old Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
     together with the transmittal materials, duly executed, and such other
     documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require (including customary
     indemnity if any of such certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed), the
     holder of such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
     therefor a certificate representing that number of New Certificates which
     such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificates
     surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article III (after

                                       12

<PAGE>

     taking into account all shares of Golden West Common Stock then held by
     such holder) and any check in respect of the Cash Consideration payable to
     the holder of such Old Certificates, dividends or distributions or for
     fractional shares that the shareholder will be entitled to receive, and the
     Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
     will be paid on any such cash or other consideration deliverable pursuant
     to this Article III.

          (c) If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
     Closing Date, any holder of record (or group of related holders of record)
     of shares of Golden West Common Stock (a "TRANSFEROR") transfers or
     conveys, in one or more transactions, a number of shares of Golden West
     Common Stock to one or more charitable organizations (as defined in Section
     170(c) of the Code) (each, a "TRANSFEREE" and together, the "TRANSFEREES")
     such that the aggregate number of shares of Golden West Common Stock so
     transferred or conveyed by the Transferor to the Transferees represents
     more than 0.1 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Golden West
     Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement, then the Transferor and the
     Transferees may jointly and irrevocably elect by providing written notice
     to Wachovia of such election (and proper provision shall be made on the
     transmittal materials to give effect to such election) that the Transferor
     and the Transferees be treated as though they were a single holder of
     record for purposes of Section 3.01 and may designate in such written
     notice to Wachovia and the transmittal materials the manner in which the
     aggregate Stock Consideration and aggregate Cash Consideration that the
     Transferor and Transferees are entitled to receive under this Article III
     shall be allocated, and distributed by the Exchange Agent, among the
     Transferor and Transferees.

          (d) None of Wachovia, Golden West or the Exchange Agent will be liable
     to any former holder of Golden West Common Stock for any shares of Wachovia
     Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
     from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
     applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

          (e) Each of Wachovia and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
     to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold,
     from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
     holder of Golden West Common Stock such amounts as it may be required to
     deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
     Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent
     that amounts are so withheld by the Wachovia, the Surviving Corporation, or
     the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be
     treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
     holders of Golden West Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and
     withholding was made by Wachovia, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
     Agent, as the case may be.

                                       13

<PAGE>

     3.05. FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Wachovia Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger;
instead, Wachovia will pay to each holder of Golden West Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Wachovia Common Stock (after
taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such holder) an amount in
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of
Wachovia Common Stock by the Market Price.

     3.06. ANTI-DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS. If Wachovia changes (or the Wachovia Board
sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a
change in) the number or kind of shares of Wachovia Common Stock outstanding by
way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization or similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Cash
Amount will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.

     3.07. DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS. (a) Each Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Merger Consideration hereunder,
and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the GCL. Golden West shall give Wachovia prompt notice upon
receipt by the Golden West of any demand for payment pursuant to Section 262 of
the GCL and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided
pursuant to applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being
hereinafter called a "DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER"), and Wachovia shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by
Wachovia.

          (b) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
     (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her right to dissent under
     Section 262 of the GCL at or prior to the Effective Time, such holder's
     shares of Golden West Common Stock shall be converted into a right to
     receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable
     provisions of this Agreement.

     3.08. EFFECT ON MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. Each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain
outstanding.

     3.09. EFFECT ON WACHOVIA STOCK. Each share of Wachovia Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding.

     3.10. STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding option to
purchase shares of Golden West Common Stock under the Golden West Stock Plans
and any other Benefit Arrangement, whether vested or unvested, exercisable or
unexercisable (each, a "GOLDEN WEST STOCK OPTION"), each Golden West Stock
Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall
immediately and fully vest and be deemed to constitute an option (a "NEW
OPTION") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as

                                       14

<PAGE>

were applicable under the terms of the stock option plan under which the Golden
West Stock Option was granted and the applicable award agreement thereunder
(taking into account the accelerated vesting provided in this Section 3.10 and
the amendments to the Golden West Stock Options as Previously Disclosed), such
number of shares of Wachovia Common Stock and at such an exercise price per
share determined as follows:

               (1) NUMBER OF SHARES. The number of shares of Wachovia Common
          Stock subject to a New Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the
          number of shares of Golden West Common Stock purchasable upon exercise
          of the Golden West Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, the
          product being rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

               (2) EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price per share of Wachovia
          Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a New Option shall be equal
          to (A) the exercise price per share of Golden West Common Stock under
          the Golden West Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, the
          quotient being rounded up to the nearest cent.

For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing adjustments shall be effected in a
manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

               (b) Before the Effective Time, Golden West, or its Board of
          Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, shall take all action
          necessary on its part to give effect to the provisions of Section
          3.10(a) and shall take such other actions reasonably requested by
          Wachovia to give effect to the foregoing. Before the Effective Time,
          Wachovia shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
          future issuance a sufficient additional number of shares of Wachovia
          Common Stock to provide for the satisfaction of its obligations with
          respect to the New Options. As soon as practicable, but in no event
          later than the Effective Time, Wachovia shall file a registration
          statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form)
          with respect to the Wachovia Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
          the New Options and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
          registration statement (and to maintain the current status of the
          prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such New
          Options remain outstanding.

                                   ARTICLE IV

     contained in or incorporated by reference into any such Regulatory Filing
     (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presented in all

          conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course

          anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office

     fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
     is a party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement,
     commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (A) that is a
     "material contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of the SEC's
     Regulation S-K, (B) that purports to restrict the conduct of any line of
     business by it or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their ability to
     compete in any line of business or (C) with respect to employment of an
     officer, director or consultant.

               (2) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under
          any material contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease,
          insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which

          affected, or under which it or its respective assets, business, or
          operations receives benefits, and there has not occurred any event

     Previously Disclosed, other than those Benefit Arrangements that are not
     material. True and complete copies of all Benefit Arrangements, including,
     but not limited to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming a
     part of any Benefit Arrangements, and all amendments thereto, have been
     made available to the other party.

               (2) All of its Benefit Arrangements, other than "multiemployer
          plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, are in compliance
          with ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. Each of its Benefit
          Arrangements which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
          meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("PENSION PLAN"), and which is
          intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has
          received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue

          Section 401(b) of the Code, and it is not aware of any circumstances
          reasonably likely to result in the loss of qualification of any such
          Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Each Benefit
          Arrangement which is intended to be part of a voluntary employees'
          beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the
          Code has (A) received an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue

          pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and it is not aware of
          circumstances likely to result in the loss of the exempt status of

          routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business)
          relating to its Benefit Arrangements. Neither it nor any of its
          Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any of its
          Benefit Arrangements that, assuming the taxable period of such
          transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject it or any of
          its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of
          the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither it nor any of its
          Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or
          penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA
          or any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

               (3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has
          been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by it or any of its
          Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated
          "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
          ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the
          single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer
          with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
          "ERISA AFFILIATE"). None of it, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
          ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a "multiemployer plan", within the
          meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any time within the last six
          years. No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of
          Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has
          not been waived, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty
          Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for
          any of its Pension Plans or by any of its ERISA Affiliates within the
          12-month period ending on the date hereof. No notices have been
          required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the Pension
          Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or
          Section 412 of the Code.

               (4) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any
          of its Benefit Arrangements have been timely made or have been
          reflected on its consolidated financial statements included in its
          Regulatory Filings. None of its Pension Plans or any single-employer
          plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates has an "accumulated funding
          deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
          of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and none of its ERISA Affiliates
          has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any
          single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates has been required
          to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current
          or most recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated
          that required minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under Section
          412 of the Code will be increased by application of Section 412(l) of
          the Code. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
          required to provide, security to any of its Pension Plans or to any
          single-employer

                                       26

<PAGE>

          plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
          the Code.

               (5) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as
          of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date
          hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
          liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
          determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
          Pension Plan's most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the
          then current value of the assets of such Pension Plan, and there has
          been no change in the financial condition of such Pension Plan since
          the last day of the most recent plan year.

               (6) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations
          for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Arrangement or
          collective bargaining agreement. Either it or its Subsidiaries may
          amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any
          liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to
          such amendment or termination.

               (7) There has been no amendment to, announcement by it or any of
          its subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
          coverage under, any Benefit Arrangement which would increase the
          expense of maintaining such Benefit Arrangement above the level of the
          expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither its
          execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
          hereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
          the termination of the employment of any of its employees within a
          specified time of the Effective Time nor shareholder approval of the
          transactions covered by this Agreement, will (A) limit its right, in
          its sole discretion, to administer or amend in any respect or
          terminate any of its Benefit Arrangements or any related trust, (B)
          entitle any of its employees or any employees of its Subsidiaries to
          severance pay or any increase in severance pay, or (C) accelerate the
          time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through
          a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
          increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
          pursuant to, any of its Benefit Arrangements. Without limiting the
          foregoing, as a result of the consummation of the transactions
          contemplated hereby (including as a result of the termination of the
          employment of any of its employees within a specified time of the
          Effective Time) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
          obligated to make a payment to an individual that would be a
          "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are
          defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such
          payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or
          to be performed in the future.

                                       27

               (8) No additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has
          been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant in a
          nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of Section
          409(A)(d)(1) of the Code) of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (n) TAXES. (1) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed (taking
     into account any extensions of time within which to file) by or with
     respect to it and its Subsidiaries have been duly, timely and accurately
     filed, (2) all Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns referred to in
     clause (1) have been paid in full, except with respect to matters contested
     in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established in
     accordance with GAAP, (3) all Taxes that it or any of its Subsidiaries is
     obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third
     party have been paid over to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely
     manner, to the extent due and payable, and (4) no extensions or waivers of
     statutes of limitation have been given by or requested in writing with
     respect to any of its U.S. federal income taxes or those of its
     Subsidiaries. It has made provision in accordance with GAAP, in the
     financial statements included in the Regulatory Filings filed before the
     date hereof, for all Taxes that accrued on or before the end of the most
     recent period covered by its Regulatory Filings filed before the date
     hereof. As of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has
     any reason to believe that any conditions exist that could reasonably be
     expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. No Liens
     for Taxes exist with respect to any of its assets or properties or those of
     its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and
     payable or that are being contested in good faith and reserved for in
     accordance with GAAP. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
     party to any distribution occurring during the two-year period prior to the
     date of this Agreement in which the parties to such distribution treated
     the distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code applied, except
     for distributions occurring among members of the same group of affiliated
     corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return.

          (o) BOOKS AND RECORDS. Its books and records and those of its
     Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all
     material respects, and there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies
     of any kind contained or reflected therein.

          (p) TAKEOVER LAWS AND PROVISIONS. It has taken all action required to
     be taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby from, and this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby are exempt from, the requirements of any "moratorium,"
     "control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "business
     combination" or other antitakeover laws and regulations of any state
     (collectively, "TAKEOVER LAWS"), including Section 203 of the GCL and
     Articles 9 and 9A of the BCA. It has taken all action required to be taken
     by it in order to make this Agreement and the transactions

                                       28

<PAGE>

          contemplated hereby comply with, and this Agreement and the
          transactions contemplated hereby do comply with, the requirements of
          any Articles, Sections or provisions of its Constituent Documents
          concerning "business combination," "fair price," "voting requirement,"
          "constituency requirement" or other related provisions (collectively,
          "TAKEOVER PROVISIONS"). In the case of Golden West, the approval of
          the Merger and this Agreement by the Golden West Board exempts this
          Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from Article Eighth
          of Golden West's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

          (q) FINANCIAL ADVISORS. None of it, its Subsidiaries or any of their
     officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
     incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees
     in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except that, in
     connection with this Agreement, Wachovia has retained Merrill Lynch & Co.
     as its financial advisor, and Golden West has retained Lehman Brothers Inc.
     as its financial advisor, the arrangements with which have been disclosed
     to Wachovia prior to the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, (1)
     Golden West has received an opinion of Lehman Brothers Inc., issued to the
     Golden West Board, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, the
     Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to holders of
     Golden West Common Stock, and (2) Wachovia has received an opinion of
     Merrill Lynch & Co., issued to the Wachovia Board, to the effect that, as
     of the date of the opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair from a
     financial point of view to Wachovia.

          (r) SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. It is in compliance with the provisions,
     including Section 404, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the certifications
     provided and to be provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof are
     accurate.

          (s) LABOR MATTERS. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
     to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
     agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
     it or any of its subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it
     or any such subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
     meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel it or
     such subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and
     conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute
     involving it or any of its subsidiaries, pending or, to the best of its
     knowledge, threatened, nor it is aware, as of the date of this Agreement,
     of any activity involving it or any of its subsidiaries' employees seeking
     to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other
     organization activity.

          (t) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. There are no proceedings, claims, actions,
     or investigations of any kind, pending or threatened, in any court, agency,
     or other governmental authority or in any arbitral body, arising under any
     Environmental Law; there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
     claim, action or

                                       29

<PAGE>

     investigation; there are no agreements, orders, judgments or decrees by or
     with any court, regulatory agency or other governmental authority, imposing
     liability or obligation under or in respect of any Environmental Law; there
     are and have been no Materials of Environmental Concern or other conditions
     at any property (owned, operated, or otherwise used by, or the subject of a
     security interest on behalf of, it or any of its subsidiaries); and there
     are no reasonably anticipated future events, conditions, circumstances,
     practices, plans, or legal requirements that could give rise to obligations
     or liabilities under any Environmental Law.

          (u) AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION. Wachovia has, or will have as of the
     Effective Time, available to it sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Cash
     Consideration.

     5.04. MERGER SUB. Wachovia represents and warrants to Golden West as
follows:

          (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND AUTHORITY. Merger Sub is a corporation
     duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction of its incorporation.

          (b) CAPITAL STOCK. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists
     of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 100
     shares are outstanding and held of record by Wachovia.

          (c) BUSINESS. Merger Sub has conducted no business other than
     activities incidental to its organization and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (d) AUTHORITY. Merger Sub has duly authorized, executed and delivered
     this Agreement, and this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby
     have been authorized by all corporate action necessary on Merger Sub's
     part. This Agreement is Merger Sub's valid and legally binding obligation,
     enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforcement may be
     limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
     fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to
     or affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles).

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    COVENANTS

     6.01. REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Wachovia and Golden West will use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the

                                       30

<PAGE>

transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with, and
furnish information to, the other party to that end.

          (b) Wachovia will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
     delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the
     Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures and other instruments
     required for the due assumption of Golden West's outstanding debt,
     guarantees, securities, and (to the extent informed of such requirement by
     Golden West) other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such
     debt, guarantees, securities or other agreements.

     6.02. SHAREHOLDER APPROVALS. (a) The Golden West Board approved this
Agreement and the plan of merger it contains and adopted resolutions
recommending as of the date hereof to Golden West's shareholders approval and
adoption of the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby.

          (b) The Wachovia Board approved this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby and adopted resolutions recommending as of the date
     hereof to Wachovia's shareholders the approval of the issuance of shares of
     Wachovia Common Stock necessary to effect the Merger and any other matters
     required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and other
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (c) The Wachovia Board and Golden West Board each will submit to its
     shareholders all matters required to be approved or adopted by shareholders
     in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of
     that obligation, Wachovia and Golden West each will take, in accordance
     with applicable law and its respective Constituent Documents, all action
     necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any
     adjournment or postponement, the "WACHOVIA MEETING" and the "GOLDEN WEST
     MEETING", respectively), as promptly as practicable, to consider and vote
     upon such matters. The Wachovia Board and Golden West Board each will use
     all reasonable best efforts to obtain from their respective shareholders a
     vote approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including a
     recommendation that its respective shareholders vote in favor of (i) in the
     case of Golden West, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the plan
     of merger contained herein and (2) in the case of Wachovia, approval of the
     issuance of the Wachovia Common Stock required for consummation of the
     Merger. However, if the Golden West Board, after consultation with outside
     counsel, determines in good faith that, because of the receipt after the
     date of this Agreement by Golden West of an Acquisition Proposal that the
     Golden West Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal,
     it would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law
     to continue to recommend the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement,
     then in submitting the plan of merger to the Golden West Meeting,

                                       31

<PAGE>

     the Golden West Board may submit the plan of merger to its shareholders
     without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as
     of the date hereof, described in Section 6.02(a), may not be rescinded or
     amended), in which event the Golden West Board may communicate the basis
     for its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders in the Joint Proxy
     Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
     required by law; PROVIDED that the Golden West Board may not take any
     actions under this sentence until after giving Wachovia at least 5 business
     days to respond to any such Acquisition Proposal (and after giving Wachovia
     notice of the latest material terms, conditions and third party in the
     Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any amendment or
     modification to this Agreement proposed by Wachovia.

     6.03. SEC FILINGS. Wachovia and Golden West will cooperate in ensuring that
all filings required under SEC Rules 165, 425 and 14a-12 are timely and properly
made. Wachovia also will prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other
applicable form (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") to be filed by Wachovia with the
SEC in connection with the issuance of Wachovia Common Stock in the Merger, and
the parties will jointly prepare the joint proxy statement and prospectus and
other proxy solicitation materials of Wachovia and Golden West constituting a
part thereof (the "JOINT PROXY STATEMENT") and all related documents. Each party
will cooperate, and will cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other
party, its counsel and its accountants, in the preparation of the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement, and, provided that both parties and
their respective Subsidiaries have cooperated as required above, Wachovia and
Golden West agree to file the Registration Statement, including the Joint Proxy
Statement in preliminary form, with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Each of Wachovia and Golden West will use all reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof and to
maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement until the Effective
Time. Wachovia shall file the opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
described in Section 7.01(f) with the SEC as an exhibit to a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement. Each party shall cooperate and provide
the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide the
other party with a copy of all such filings with the SEC. Wachovia also agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to furnish for inclusion in the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement all information concerning it,
its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be required by
applicable law in connection with the foregoing.

          (b) Wachovia and Golden West each agrees, as to itself and its
     Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
     for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration
     Statement will, at

                                       32

<PAGE>

     the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
     thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
     untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
     not misleading and (2) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or
     supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the
     time of the Wachovia Meeting or the Golden West Meeting, as the case may
     be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
     material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
     statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
     statement was made, not misleading. Wachovia and Golden West each further
     agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would
     cause any of the statements in the Joint Proxy Statement or the
     Registration Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any
     material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
     statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
     party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy
     Statement or the Registration Statement.

          (c) Wachovia will advise Golden West, promptly after Wachovia receives
     notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
     effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
     any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Wachovia Common
     Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat
     of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for
     the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
     information.

     6.04. PRESS RELEASES. Wachovia and Golden West will consult with each other
before issuing any press release, written and broadly disseminated employee
communication or other written shareholder communication with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such communication or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; PROVIDED that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such communication or make such public
statement as may be required by applicable law or securities exchange rules.
Wachovia and Golden West will cooperate to develop all public communications and
make appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other party.

     6.05. ACCESS; INFORMATION. (a) Each of Wachovia and Golden West agrees that
upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, it will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other
party, and the other party's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized Representatives, such access during normal business hours throughout
the period before the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties,
personnel and to such other information

                                       33
<PAGE>

as the other party may reasonably request and, during such period, it will
furnish promptly to the other party (1) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities or banking laws, and (2) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request.
Neither Wachovia nor Golden West will be required to afford access or disclose
information that would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any
binding agreement with any third party. The parties will make appropriate
substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence applies.

          (b) Each party will hold any information which is nonpublic and
     confidential to the extent required by, and in accordance, with the
     Confidentiality Agreement between Wachovia and Golden West (the
     "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

          (c) No investigation by one party of the business and affairs of the
     other, pursuant to this Section 6.05 or otherwise, will affect or be deemed
     to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
     this Agreement, or the conditions to such other party's obligation to
     consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.06. ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. Golden West will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, agents, advisors
and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or
have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal;
PROVIDED that, in the event Golden West receives an unsolicited BONA FIDE
Acquisition Proposal, from a Person other than Wachovia or an Other Person (as
defined below), after the execution of this Agreement, and the Golden West Board
concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal and,
after considering the advice of outside counsel, that failure to take such
actions would result in a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable law, Golden West may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions; PROVIDED that
prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant
to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement. Golden West will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any persons other than Wachovia ("OTHER PERSONS") with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Golden
West will promptly (within one business day) advise Wachovia following receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep

                                       34

<PAGE>

Wachovia apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
(including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a
current basis.

          (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Golden West or
     the Golden West Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under
     the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, PROVIDED that
     such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
     pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

     6.07. AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS. Not later than the 15th day before the mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement, Golden West will deliver to Wachovia a schedule of
each person that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to
be, as of the date of the Golden West Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of
Golden West (each, a "GOLDEN WEST AFFILIATE") as that term is used in Rule 145
under the Securities Act. Golden West will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each person who may be deemed to be a Golden West Affiliate to execute and
deliver to Wachovia and Golden West on or before the date of mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement an agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
ANNEX 2.

     6.08. TAKEOVER LAWS AND PROVISIONS. No party will take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those
transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of,
any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party will take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby not to comply
with any Takeover Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to make those transactions comply with (or continue to comply
with) the Takeover Provisions.

     6.09. EXCHANGE LISTING. Wachovia will use all reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Wachovia Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof to be approved for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable,
and in any event before the Effective Time.

     6.10. REGULATORY APPLICATIONS. Wachovia and Golden West and their
respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to
prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings and to
obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "REQUISITE REGULATORY APPROVALS"), and will make all
necessary filings in respect of those Requisite Regulatory Approvals as soon as
practicable. Each of Wachovia and Golden West will have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each
case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to all written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental

                                       35

<PAGE>

Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the other
party with respect to obtaining all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and each party will
keep the other party appraised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (b) Wachovia and Golden West will, upon request, furnish the other
     party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
     officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
     necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application
     made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or
     to any third party or Governmental Authority in connection with the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.11. INDEMNIFICATION. Following the Effective Time, Wachovia will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers
and employees of Golden West and its Subsidiaries (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY")
against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
(collectively, "COSTS") as incurred, in connection with any claim, action
(whether threatened, pending or contemplated), suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether arising before or after the Effective Time and whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), (and shall advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
provided the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification) (1) without limitation of
clause (2), to the same extent as such persons are indemnified or have the right
to advancement of expenses pursuant to the Constituent Documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on the date of this Agreement with
Golden West and its Subsidiaries, and (2) to the fullest extent permitted by
law.

          (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Wachovia
     will obtain and maintain director's and officer's liability insurance that
     serves to reimburse, and covers, the present and former officers and
     directors of Golden West or any of their respective Subsidiaries
     (determined as of the Effective Time) (as opposed to Golden West or such
     Subsidiary) with respect to claims against such directors and officers
     arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including
     the transactions contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain at
     least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no
     less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as that coverage provided under
     the director's and officer's liability insurance that Wachovia obtained for
     directors and officers of other financial institutions that Wachovia
     acquired in recent, comparable merger transactions (taking into account the

                                       36
<PAGE>

     relative market capitalizations of Golden West as compared to such other
     financial institutions); PROVIDED that officers and directors of Golden
     West or any Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide
     customary representations and warranties to Wachovia's insurance carrier
     for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

          (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
     Section 6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
     investigation described above, will promptly notify Wachovia; PROVIDED that
     failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Wachovia under
     Section 6.12(a) unless and only to the extent that Wachovia is actually and
     materially prejudiced as a consequence.

          (d) If Wachovia or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with
     or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving
     entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially
     all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Wachovia will
     cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
     Wachovia will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Effective
     Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
     each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

     6.12. EMPLOYEE MATTERS. From the Effective Time through the date that
Wachovia determines to generally transition Golden West's benefit arrangements
(such date being referred to herein as the "BENEFITS TRANSITION DATE"), Wachovia
shall provide the employees of Golden West and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (the "COVERED EMPLOYEES") with employee benefits and compensation
plans, programs and arrangements that are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to the employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and
arrangements provided by Golden West or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to
such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Benefits Transition Date, Wachovia shall provide the Covered Employees with
employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that are
substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Wachovia and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, a Covered Employee whose employment is terminated by Wachovia other
than for Cause (as defined in Schedule 4.01(j)), disability or death or who
terminates employment for Good Reason (as defined in Schedule 4.01(j)), during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary
thereof, shall be entitled to receive the severance payments and benefits under
the Wachovia Severance Pay Plan as in effect on the date hereof and Previously
Disclosed to Golden West and as such plan may be amended from time to time (the
"WACHOVIA SEVERANCE PLAN"). The Wachovia Severance Plan will not be amended to
reduce benefits to Covered Employees until after the second anniversary of the
Effective Time unless an amendment is

                                       37
<PAGE>

necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Following the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, Wachovia and Golden West shall cooperate in good
faith to agree to the appropriate job categorization of the Covered Employees
for purposes of the Wachovia Severance Plan, taking into account their
compensation, authority, seniority, duties and any other factors deemed
relevant.

          (b) From and after the Benefits Transition Date, Wachovia shall (1)
     provide all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of
     eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for
     benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), under any
     employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted,
     maintained or contributed to by Wachovia or any of its Subsidiaries in
     which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all actual periods
     of employment with Golden West or any of its Subsidiaries (or their
     predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the extent such actual
     periods of employment are credited by Golden West for purposes of a
     comparable plan in which the applicable Covered Employee participated
     immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) cause any pre-existing
     conditions, limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical
     examinations under any welfare benefit plans of Wachovia or any of its
     Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their
     eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan (for
     a comparable level of coverage) in which the applicable Covered Employee
     participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the Benefits
     Transition Date with respect to Golden West's medical and/or dental benefit
     plans for Covered Employees occurs in the middle of a plan year, then
     Covered Employees and their dependents who are then participating in a
     deductible-based medical and/or dental plan sponsored by Golden West will
     be given credit for deductibles and eligible out-of-pocket expenses
     incurred towards deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion
     of the plan year preceding the Benefits Transition Date in a comparable
     deductible-based medical and/or dental plan of Wachovia or any of its
     Subsidiaries for the Wachovia benefit plan year that begins with or
     includes the Benefits Transition Date.

          (c) From and after the Effective Time, Wachovia will assume and honor
     all accrued obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former
     employees of Golden West and its Subsidiaries under the Golden West Benefit
     Arrangements (as they may be amended in accordance with Sections 4.01(j)
     and 4.01(k) hereof, and including any additional arrangements permitted
     thereby), and take all actions necessary to effectuate the agreements set
     forth on Schedule 6.12(c) hereof. If Wachovia or any of its successors or
     assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the
     continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers
     all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in
     each case, Wachovia will cause proper provision to be made so that the
     successors and assigns of Wachovia will assume the obligations set forth in
     this Section 6.12.

                                       38
<PAGE>

     6.13. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Wachovia and Golden West will give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that
(a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to
the failure of a condition in Article VII.

     6.14. EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(B). Assuming that Golden
West delivers to Wachovia the Section 16 Information in a timely and accurate
manner before the Effective Time, the Wachovia Board, or a committee of
"non-employee directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), will reasonably promptly thereafter and in any
event before the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by
the Golden West Insiders of Wachovia Common Stock in exchange for shares of
Golden West Common Stock, and of options to purchase shares of Wachovia Common
Stock upon conversion of options to purchase shares of Golden West Common Stock,
in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are approved by the
Wachovia Board or by such committee thereof, and are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, such that any such
receipt will be so exempt.

     6.15. CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS; RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. Golden West and
Wachovia shall consult with respect to their loan, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) and Golden West shall make such modifications or changes to its
policies and practices, if any, and at such date prior to the Effective Time, as
may be mutually agreed upon. Golden West and Wachovia shall also consult with
respect to the character, amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken
by each of them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall take such charges in accordance with GAAP, as may be mutually agreed upon;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Golden West shall not be obligated to take any such
charges pursuant to this Section 6.15 unless and until Wachovia irrevocably
acknowledges to Golden West in writing that all conditions to Wachovia's
obligations to consummate the Merger under Article VII have been satisfied or,
where legally permitted, waived. No party's representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or breached
in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes
to such policies and practices which may be undertaken on account of this
Section 6.15.

     be expected, after the Effective Time, to have a Material Adverse Effect on

     HOWEVER, that no conditions that are reasonably consistent with the
     regulations or published guidelines as in effect as of the date of this
     Agreement (or recent practice prior to the date of this Agreement in

     8.01. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger may be
abandoned, at any time before the Effective Time, by Wachovia or (except as
otherwise provided below) Golden West:

          (a) MUTUAL AGREEMENT. With the mutual agreement of the other party.

          (b) BREACH. Upon 60 days' prior written notice of termination, if
     there has occurred and is continuing: (1) a breach by the other party of
     any representation or warranty contained herein, or (2) a breach by the
     other party of any of the covenants or agreements in this Agreement;
     PROVIDED that such breach (under either clause (1) or (2)) would entitle
     the non-breaching party not to consummate the Merger under Article VII.

          (c) ADVERSE ACTION. If (i) the other party's board of directors
     submits this Agreement (or the plan of merger contained herein) to its

     modifies (or publicly discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and
     adversely modify) its recommendation referred to in Section 6.02 or (iii)
     in the case solely of Wachovia, the Golden West Board recommends to its
     shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger; or (iv) solely
     in the case of Wachovia, if the Golden West Board negotiates or authorizes
     the conduct of negotiations (and twenty business days have elapsed without
     such negotiations being discontinued) with a third party (it being
     understood and agreed that "negotiate" shall not be deemed to include the
     request and receipt of information from, any person that submits an
     Acquisition Proposal or discussions regarding such information for the sole
     purpose of ascertaining the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) regarding
     an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

          (d) DELAY. If the Effective Time has not occurred by the close of
     business on March 31, 2007; PROVIDED that the right to terminate this
     Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) shall not be available to any party
     whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the
     cause of, or materially contributed to, the failure of the Effective Time
     to occur on or before such date.

          (e) DENIAL OF REGULATORY APPROVAL. If the approval of any Governmental
     Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other
     transactions contemplated hereby is denied by final, nonappealable action
     of such Governmental Authority; PROVIDED that the right to terminate this
     Agreement under this Section 8.01(e) shall not be available to any party
     whose failure to

                                       42

<PAGE>

     comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or
     materially contributed to, such action.

     8.02. EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. If this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger is abandoned, no party will have any liability or
further obligation under this Agreement, except that termination will not
relieve a party from liability for any willful breach by it of this Agreement
and except that Section 6.05(b), this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX
will survive termination of this Agreement.

     8.03. TERMINATION FEE. Golden West shall pay to Wachovia, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, $995,000,000 (the "TERMINATION FEE") as follows:

               (1) In the event that (A) either Wachovia or Golden West shall
          terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or if Wachovia
          shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) or
          8.01(c)(ii), and (B) the requisite vote of the Golden West
          shareholders under Section 7.01(a) shall not have been obtained after
          a vote of the Golden West shareholders has been taken and completed at
          the Golden West Meeting, and (C) at any time after the date of this
          Agreement and prior to such vote, a BONA FIDE Acquisition Proposal
          with respect to Golden West shall have been made public and not
          withdrawn or abandoned, and (D) within 18 months from the date of such
          termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Golden West is
          consummated or a definitive agreement is entered into by Golden West
          with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Golden West,
          then Golden West shall pay to Wachovia the Termination Fee within five
          business days after the date of the event described in clause (D).

               (2) In the event that (A) Wachovia shall terminate this Agreement
          pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(c)(iv) or either of
          Wachovia or Golden West shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
          Section 8.01(d), and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement

          Proposal, Golden West shall have breached any of its representations,
          warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, then
          Golden West shall pay to Wachovia the Termination Fee (x) if such
          breach was other than one described in the succeeding clause (y) of
          this sentence, and only if an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
          Golden West is consummated or a definitive agreement is entered into
          by Golden West with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
          Golden West within 18 months from the date of such termination, within
          five business days after such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or
          such agreement

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

          is entered into by Golden West, or (y) if such breach was a willful
          and material breach of Section 6.01(a), 6.02(c), 6.03(a), 6.06(a),
          6.08 or 6.10(a), on the business day immediately following such
          termination.

               (3) In the event that Wachovia shall terminate this Agreement
          pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(iii), then Golden West shall pay the
          Termination Fee on the business day immediately following such
          termination.

          (b) Golden West acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
     Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Wachovia would not enter
     into this Agreement. In the event that Golden West fails to pay when due
     any amounts payable under this Section 8.03, then (i) Golden West shall
     reimburse Wachovia for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and
     reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of
     such overdue amount, and (ii) Golden West shall pay to Wachovia interest on

     9.07. ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement
represents the entire understanding of Wachovia and Golden West regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all other oral or written
agreements previously made or purported to be made, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and will not impair the rights of a party to make a response or
propose amendments or modifications as contemplated by the final proviso to
Section 6.02(c)). No representation, warranty, inducement, promise,
understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been made or
relied on by any party in entering into this Agreement. Except for Section 6.11,
which is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties to the extent stated,
nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any person other than Wachovia, Merger
Sub and Golden West.

     9.08. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or
the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force
and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination, the parties will negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree
upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent
of the parties.

     9.09. ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, before the
Effective Time, Wachovia may revise the structure of the Merger or otherwise
revise the method of effecting the Merger and related transactions, PROVIDED
that (1) such revision does not alter or change the kind or amount of
consideration to be delivered to the shareholders of Golden West and the holders
of Golden West Stock Options, (2) such revision does not adversely affect the
tax consequences to the shareholders of Golden West, (3) such revised structure
or method does not materially delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in relation to the structure contemplated herein,
and (4) such revision does not, and is not reasonably likely to, otherwise cause
any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not to be capable of being
fulfilled (unless duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof).
This Agreement and any related documents will be appropriately amended in order
to reflect any such revised structure or method.
