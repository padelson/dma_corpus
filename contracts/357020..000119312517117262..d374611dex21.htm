(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled
Company Shares and (B) Dissenting Company Shares) shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into, and thereafter represent only,
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock or the
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with _Section 2.8_ (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the
manner provided in _Section 2.10_).

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (including any such shares held in
the treasury of the Company), or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to
the Effective Time ("Cancelled Company Shares") shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall

-15- ##### Table of Contents

  

 other issuance of Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Units
permitted by _Section 5.1(b)_ of this Agreement), reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither
have voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected, and not effectively withdrawn or
lost, their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 13.02 of the MBCA (collectively,
"Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_.
Such Company Stockholder shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted
by the MBCA to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares. At the Effective Time,
the Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder
who holds Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 13.02 of the MBCA; _provided_ that all Dissenting Company Shares held
by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares under such Section 13.02 of the MBCA shall no longer be
considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the later
of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been
irrevocably lost or withdrawn or has expired, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock or
the Uncertificated Shares in the manner provided in  _Section 2.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals and attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Massachusetts Law
and received by the Company with respect to rights to appraisal or in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the right to direct and participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Massachusetts Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to or approve any withdrawal of any demands for appraisal, or settle
or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting
Company Shares.

 

(d) _Company Compensatory Awards_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of such Company Restricted Stock
Units or Company Performance Restricted Stock Units, each Company Restricted
Stock Unit and Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
set forth in this _Section 2.7(d)_.

(i) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding and either (A)
vests at the Effective Time or (B) is held by a non-employee member of the
Company Board (each, a "Vested Restricted Stock Unit") shall be cancelled and
terminated as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall receive,
subject to _Section 2.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Vested Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the
"Restricted Stock Unit Consideration"). The Company shall pay to each holder
of a Vested Restricted Stock Unit the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration
described in the immediately preceding sentence (through the Companys or a
Company Subsidiarys payroll system, or the Companys or a Company
Subsidiarys equity award administrator, as may be applicable and in
accordance with the Companys payroll practices for service providers located
outside of the United States) on either (A) the first regularly scheduled
payroll date after the Closing or (B) if such first payroll

 



-16- ##### Table of Contents

  

 date is scheduled for payment prior to the fifth Business Day after the
Closing, the second regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing, in any
such case, consistent with past practices, including accounting for all
applicable withholding.

(ii) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding and unvested as
of the Effective Time and not described in _Section 2.7(d)(i)_ (an "Unvested
Restricted Stock Unit") shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, be converted into the right to receive, subject to
_Section 2.8(e)_, an amount of cash (without interest) determined by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Unvested Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration (the "Unvested Restricted
Stock Unit Consideration"). The Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration
will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to the
Company Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the same vesting restrictions and continued service requirements,
except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of the
Company Restricted Stock Unit or to which the holder consents. Payment of the
Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration shall be made, subject to such
terms and conditions, on the vesting dates applicable to the Company
Restricted Stock Units as described in this _Section 2.7(d)(ii)_.

(iii) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance-
based vesting of each Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated
in full with all performance conditions being deemed achieved at 100% and
each such Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit shall, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be converted into the
right to receive, subject to  _Section 2.8(e)_, an amount of cash (without
interest) determined by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Company Performance Restricted Stock
Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Merger
Consideration (the "Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit Consideration").
The Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit Consideration will be subject
to the same time-based vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of the
Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit or to which the holder consents.
Payment of the Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit Consideration shall
be made, subject to such terms and conditions, on the time-based vesting dates
applicable to the Company Performance Restricted Stock Units as described in
this _Section 2.7(d)(iii)_.

(e) The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by _Section 2.7(d)_ under all Company Restricted
Stock Unit agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company,
including delivering all required notices and obtaining any required consent.
As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each of the holders of
Vested Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration
(through the Surviving Corporations or a Surviving Corporation Subsidiarys
payroll system, or the Surviving Corporations or a Surviving Corporations
Subsidiary equity award administrator, as may be applicable and in accordance
with the Companys payroll practices for service providers located outside of
the United States) on either (A) the first regularly scheduled payroll date
after the Closing or (B) if such first payroll date is scheduled for payment
prior to the fifth Business Day after the Closing, the second regularly
scheduled payroll date after the Closing, in any such case, consistent with
past practices, including accounting for all applicable withholding. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not take any action after the date of
this Agreement that would accelerate the vesting of the Company Restricted
Stock Units in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(f) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to:
(i) cause any offering period and purchase period (or similar period during
which shares may be purchased) underway as of the date of this Agreement under
the Company ESPP to be terminated as of no later than the last payroll date
immediately preceding the Effective Time (the "Final Exercise Date"); (ii)
make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect any shortened
offering period or purchase period (or similar period), but otherwise treat
any 

 



-17- ##### Table of Contents

  

 such shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) as a
fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period, as
applicable, for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) cause each
participants shares purchase right under the Company ESPP (the "Company ESPP
Rights") outstanding as of the Final Exercise Date to be exercised as of the
Final Exercise Date; (iv) provide that no further offering periods or
purchase periods (or similar periods during which shares may be purchased)
shall commence under the Company ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement;
(v) provide that no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the rate of
his or her contributions to the Company ESPP on or after the date of this
Agreement; (vi) provide that no individual who is not participating in the
Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in
the Company ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement; and (vii) terminate
the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that
termination of the Company ESPP shall be subject to the consummation of
the Merger. Each outstanding option under the Company ESPP on the Final
Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. On the Final
Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP
within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each
participant under the Company ESPP will be used to purchase shares in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each share purchased by a
participant of the Company ESPP and issued thereunder will be cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, subject to withholding
of applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. No further Company
ESPP Rights will be granted after the date of this Agreement, and no further
Company ESPP Rights will be exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final
Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice of the setting of the
Final Exercise Date and termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the
Company ESPP (which termination will be subject to the consummation of the
Merger).

 

(g) _Treatment of Company Stock Plan_. Effective as of, and contingent upon
the occurrence of, the Effective Time, the Company, acting through the
Company Board or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
reasonably necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plan. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to issue Company
Common Stock or other share capital of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of a Company Option or
Company Restricted Stock Unit. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit
informing such holder of the treatment of their Company Restricted Stock
Units contemplated by this Agreement.

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a U.S.
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.7(a)(i)_, an
amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled thereunder (the
"Aggregate Consideration"). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Payment
Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of
the United States government (such cash amount being referred to herein as the
"Exchange Fund"). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by  _Section 2.7(a)(i)_, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to
make such payments contemplated by _Section 2.7(a)(i)_.

 



-18- ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_,
(A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.7(a)(i)_. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent (in the case
of Certificated shares) together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as the Payment Agent may reasonably require, the
holders of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.7(a)(i)_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in accordance with _Section 2.8(e)_), and the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.8(c)_,
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, upon receipt of
an "agents message" by the Payment Agent and confirmation of the book-entry
transfer of such Uncertificated Shares into the Payment Agents account with
Depository Trust Company (and such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request), the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in accordance
with _Section 2.8(e)_), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Payment Agent shall accept such
Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and only if the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable. Parent shall pay all other transfer taxes.

 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws,
it being understood that no deduction or withholding shall be required under
the Tax Law of a jurisdiction outside the United States with respect to
payments to holders of Company Common Stock by reason of Parent (or any other

 



-19- ##### Table of Contents

  

 direct or indirect owner of Merger Sub) being organized outside the United
States. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid
over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Person shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Persons previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_
shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to the Surviving
Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable
Merger Consideration (without interest and subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws) to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 2.8_. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms
of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock
represented thereby. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Company Shares. 

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making
of an affidavit and undertaking of an indemnity, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Payment Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary amount
as Parent or the Payment Agent may determine is reasonable and appropriate as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

disclosure is applicable to any section or subsection of this _Article III_
), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

3.1 _ Organization; Good Standing_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Massachusetts Law, and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease, operate or otherwise hold its properties and assets. The Company
is not in violation of its Constitutional Documents. The Company is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good
standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the
United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has Made Available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the Companys Constitutional Documents, in each case in effect as of
the date of this Agreement. The Company has Made Available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies (excluding portions thereof relating to the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Companys
related strategic process in connection with the Merger) of the minutes (or,
in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof as of the date of
this Agreement) of all meetings of the Company Stockholders, the Company
Board and each committee of the Company Board held since August 1, 2013 and

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to

hereunder and, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, and no additional corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated hereby, other than obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally, and (ii) is subject to general principles
of equity (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Enforceability
Limitations").

(c) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held has (i) determined
that the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the

interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to
enter into this Agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and

Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company Capital Stock that is necessary to adopt this Agreement and
consummate the Merger. No other vote of the holders of any class or series of
the Company Capital Stock or other Company Securities is required by Law, the
Constitutional Documents of the Company or otherwise in connection with the
consummation of any of transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated by
the Company, including the Merger.

3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, the compliance by the Company with the provisions hereof and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby do not
and will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the Constitutional
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) subject to obtaining
such Consents set forth in  _Section 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,

loss of benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, impair the rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, result in the termination of, accelerate
the performance required by or result in a right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration under, any Material Contract, in each case, in any

date of this Agreement, a list of all real property owned by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company (such real property, together with all of the
buildings, structures and other improvements thereon, the "Owned Real
Property"). The Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable) has
good and marketable title in fee simple to all Owned Real Property, free and

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any tenant under any Lease is in
material default thereunder, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no event has
occurred or circumstance exists which, with the delivery of notice, the
passage of time or both, would constitute such a material breach or material
default, or permit the termination, modification or acceleration of rent under
such Lease. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
written notice of any actual or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, or notice of termination or
cancellation or material breach or default that affect any Leased Real
Property or any part thereof, and neither of the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of any
Governmental Authority or other Person to take all or any part thereof
pursuant to any such proceeding; and except for renewal and expansion
provisions as set forth in the Leases, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns, holds, is obligated under or is a party to, any option,
right of first refusal or offer or other contractual right to purchase,
acquire, sell, assign or dispose of any real estate or any portion thereof or
interest therein.

Standard Form PIIA, whereby such employee, contractor or consultant assigns
such Company-Owned Intellectual Property to the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary, except where any failure would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of
the Company, none of such employees, contractors, and consultants has breached
such Persons proprietary information, confidentiality and invention
assignment agreement obligations relating to the property, ownership,
development, use or transfer of material Company-owned Intellectual Property,
except where any breach would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a

and all necessary documents, recordations and certificates in connection with
such Company Registered Intellectual Property have been filed with the
relevant Governmental Authorities in the United States or foreign
jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of prosecuting, perfecting
and maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual Property, except in cases
where the Company or its Subsidiaries has chosen to abandon an application or
registration.

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right,
title and interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce and all
causes of action and claims for past infringement or violation thereof) the

Permitted Liens). Except for any ex parte proceedings, no Company-Owned
Intellectual Property, is subject to any Legal Proceeding restricting in any
material manner, the use, transfer, or Licensing thereof by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or which may materially affect the validity, use or
enforceability of such Company-Owned Intellectual Property.

or research center during a period of time during which such employee,

the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters" and together with the
other commitment letters and documents entered into between Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Affiliates and Financing Sources other than Sponsor and
Lender, the "Financing Documents"), pursuant to which, and subject only to the

any portion of the Financing will be unavailable to Parent and Merger Sub at
the Effective Time. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters that

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters and subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in  _Section 7.1_ and

with the covenants set forth herein, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by

Sub including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Parent and
Merger Sub on the Closing Date, will be sufficient to fund all of the amounts
required to be provided by Parent and/or Merger Sub for the consummation of

_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise out of a breach of

Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company shall
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 60 calendar days)
after the Proxy Statement is disseminated to Company Stockholders; _provided_

insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by a
proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company
Stockholder Meeting, (ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, Order or a request from the
SEC or its staff, or (iii) after prior consultation with Parent, the Company

disclosure that the Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise
made available to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing
materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with a Company
Board Recommendation Change) or (B) to provide additional time to solicit

proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger in accordance
with Massachusetts Law, submit the Merger for approval of the Company
Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting, recommend to the Company
Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its
reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the
Company Stockholder Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Company Board
Recommendation Change, unless such Company Board Recommendation Change is
specifically permitted by _Section 6.5_.

against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company
Stockholders (including, for these purposes, by disclosing that it is taking
no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer by the Company Stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer;
_provided_ that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d9(f) under the Exchange Act or a statement
that the Company Board has received and is currently evaluating such
Acquisition Proposal shall not be prohibited or be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change) within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement thereof or such fewer number of days as remain prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting, or (v) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation following any Acquisition Proposal having been publicly
made, proposed or communicated (and not publicly withdrawn) within ten (10)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing; _provided_ that Parent may
not make such request more than one time with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal unless there shall have been an additional public announcement by
the Company with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (each of clauses (i),
(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), a "Company Board Recommendation Change").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, (1) in connection with an Intervening Event or (2) if the Company
Board receives an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may (x) in the case of clause (1) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or (y) in the case of clause (2), effect a Board
Recommendation Change and authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if, prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change and/or authorizing the Company to
terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal: 

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Massachusetts Law;

(ii) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing at least five (5)
Business Days before taking such action of its intention to do so, and shall
have specified the reasons therefor, including (A) if such notice is made in
connection with an Intervening Event, a reasonable description of the
Intervening Event and (B) if such notice is made in connection with a
Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously with such notice
furnished a copy (if any) of the proposed agreement under which such Superior
Proposal is proposed to be consummated and any other material transaction
documents, including any financing commitment letters (it being understood and
agreed that, with respect to any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have provided
Parent a new written notice and a new additional period of three (3) Business
Days in respect of each such amendment); it being agreed that any of the
foregoing notice and any amendment to update such notice and the determination
to deliver such notice, or update or amend public disclosure with respect
thereto shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement;

(iii) during such five (5) Business Day period or, if applicable, such
additional three (3) Business Day period(s), prior to its effecting a Company
Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to negotiate
with Parents Representatives in good faith regarding any revisions to the
terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent;

(iv) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written offer to modify
the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such five (5) Business Day
period or, if applicable, such additional three (3) Business Day period(s),
the Company Board, after expiration of the applicable period and after taking
into

 consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
proposed by Parent, shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that (A) such Superior
Proposal continued to be a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Massachusetts Law or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Massachusetts Law; and

 

(v) in the case of the Company terminating this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
have paid, or caused the payment of, the Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 8.3(b)(iii)_.

Act and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board and/or any committee thereof determines in good faith (after
consultation from its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Massachusetts
Law; _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or any substantially similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
a Company Board Recommendation Change (including for purposes of _Section
8.1(f)_) unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to
the Company Stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger in such disclosure.

 6.6 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release relating
to this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which shall be
agreed to by both Parent and the Company. Thereafter, none of the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any
public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any applicable securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental
Authority to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever
situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties
hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance; _provided_ that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.6_ shall not apply to (i) any release or announcement made or proposed to
be made by the Company following a Company Board Recommendation Change or
(ii) any filing to be made by a party pursuant to the Exchange Act.

 

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all action necessary
within their respective control (including, in the case of the Company and the
Company Board, grant all necessary approvals) to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate, or if it is not possible to eliminate, to minimize
the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing from the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of

Merger Sub, and their respective Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, assets,
books and records, Contracts, facilities and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable
Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information,

 



-61- ##### Table of Contents

  

 (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material
risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
privilege held by the Company or its Subsidiaries and (c) access to a
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party otherwise
bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right
to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and _provided
further_ that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and
remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub hereunder. In the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding
sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the
applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate any
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or waive such a privilege. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable
Lease and the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Representatives pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 6.8_. Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any reports,
analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

6.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities
of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all (i) indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 6.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and as in effect on the date of this Agreement, between
(A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current
or former directors and officers as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to
the terms of such agreements as in effect on the date hereof and (B)
any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and executes an indemnification
agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company and no more favorable to
such person than the current form of indemnification agreement with its
directors and officers that has been made available to Parent (the
"Indemnified Persons") and (ii) indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation provisions in any Constitutional Documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, in each case
until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time. In addition, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses, covering acts and omissions of
directors and officers, in each case in their respective capacities as such,
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
("DandO Insurance"), _provided_ that the Company shall not pay, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay, annual premiums in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%)
amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium") (which premiums the Company represents
and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 3.23_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter). The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such a "tail" policy in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of
such properties or assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this 
_Section 6.10_.

(d) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons (and their heirs) are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.10_ with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons (and their heirs) under this _Section 6.10_ shall be in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements, if any, with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as Made Available to Parent,
or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). The obligations and
liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.10_ shall be joint and several.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to or

prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating, or from
causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate, any such Employee
Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide, for the benefit of Continuing
Employees, employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
the benefits that were provided to the Continuing Employees under
the Employee Plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
employee benefit plans, but excluding equity-based benefits and individual
employment agreements, the "Company Plans"). In addition, base salary, bonus
opportunity or regular wages as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall not be decreased for a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time for any Continuing Employee who continues to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate during that period.

(c) To the extent that a Company Plan is made available to any Continuing
Employee at or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use reasonable best
efforts to cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation, sick
time or paid time off accrual and severance pay entitlement); _provided_ that
such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent commercially reasonable: (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such
plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent it would have been waived under the comparable Old Plan, and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during any unfinished
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full
credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and
(iii) the Surviving Corporation shall credit the accounts of such Continuing
Employee under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable
Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to
such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be
subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future
accruals.

 

(d) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the Continuing
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefits matters set forth in this
_Section 6.11_, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication and Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, (ii) subject
to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this  _Section
6.11_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company
Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; or (iii) to constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated as an amendment or
modification of any Company Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan arrangement.
No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any
beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
and benefits that may be provided to any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Affiliates or
under any benefit plan which any of them may maintain, or otherwise.

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation to

amount required, together with other financial resources of Parent and Merger
Sub, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Parent and
Merger Sub on the Closing Date, to consummate the Merger on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent
and/or Merger Sub to enforce their rights under the Financing Documents; (iii)

consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that Parent shall have the right to permit any

all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing provided
such conditions are then capable of being fulfilled) shall have been
satisfied or waived other than the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ or (B) _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ as a result of the enactment,
issuance or promulgation of any Law, or the issuance or grant of any Order,
by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the PRC, in each
case, other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Company,
then, in each case, Parent shall pay to the Company the Reverse Termination
Fee within seven (7) Business Days after demand by the Company; _provided_
that, "Reverse Termination Fee" for purposes of this _Section 8.3(c)(iii)_
shall mean $14,250,000.

 

(iv) The Reverse Termination Fee shall be paid by the Guarantor pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of the Payment Guarantee. If this Agreement
is terminated in circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable
and the US Dollar Equivalent of the Guaranteed Amount shall for any reason be
less than the Reverse Termination Fee, then an amount equal to the
difference of (A) the Reverse Termination Fee less (B) the portion of the US
Dollar Equivalent of the Guaranteed Amount actually released to the Company
PRC Subsidiary by the Guarantor, shall be paid directly by Parent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the Company.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
any circumstance in which the Company receives payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_, the receipt of the Reverse
Termination Fee in such circumstance shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or
assignees (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for any and all losses
and damages suffered or incurred as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise arising out of, or directly or
indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon receipt
of the Reverse Termination Fee in such circumstance, none of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any other document, theory of law or equity or
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, in
contract, in tort or otherwise (except that (x) the obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to survive and (y) Parent shall also
be obligated with respect to _Section 8.3(e)_). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no Parent Related Party, except Parent and
Merger Sub, shall have any liability for any obligation or liability to the
Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect
stockholders for any claim for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of
this Agreement (including any willful and material breach), or the failure of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby to be consummated, or
in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be have been made in
connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Following the receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee in such
circumstance, (A) none of the Company or any Company Related Party shall be
entitled to bring, maintain or support any Legal Proceedings against Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and (B) the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Legal Proceedings pending
in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent maintained by
the Company or any Company Related Party against Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly.

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee nor
shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse Termination

 Fee, on more than one occasion, whether or not such termination fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

(e) _Liquidated Damages_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) each of the Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and the Company, respectively, in the circumstances in which
such termination fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision and (iii) without these agreements, neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to in this _Article VIII_ and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company or Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
non-paying party for the payment of any amount set forth in in this _Article
VIII_ , the non-paying shall pay the other party its costs and expenses in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the
annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as
is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; _provided_ that in the event that this
Agreement has been adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with
Massachusetts Law, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires
the approval or adoption of such Company Stockholders under Massachusetts Law
without such approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified
or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or
otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the
time of the amendment.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein; _provided_ that after the Requisite
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to
applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the Company
Stockholders without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the
part of a party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party or parties, as applicable. Any failure or delay in exercising any right
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment
or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they
would otherwise have hereunder.

9.3 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties; _provided_ that (a) Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to an Affiliate of Parent that has at least the same financial
resources as Parent and (b) Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
another wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, in each case, at any time upon
prior consultation with the Company so long as such assignment does not give
rise to any withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_, in which case all
references herein to "Parent" or "Merger Sub" shall be deemed references to
such respective assignee, except that all representations and warranties made
herein with respect to Parent or Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement
(or with respect to Merger Sub, as of the date of the Joinder) shall be
deemed to be representations and warranties made with respect to such assignee
as of the date of such assignment and provided that no such assignment shall
relieve either of Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations
hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligation. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which
the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is
validly terminated by the parties thereto.

9.5 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Section 6.10_, and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to
receive the consideration pursuant to the Merger, as set forth in _Article
II_.

9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

 



-78- ##### Table of Contents

  

 agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 __(a) Except as provided in _Section 8.3(b)_, _Section 8.3(c)_, _Section
8.3(d)_ and  _Section 8.3(e)_ and subject to _Section 9.9_ ( _Dispute
Resolution_ ), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. __

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
and/or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other
under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or
parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement
evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The Federal Arbitration
Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to
the dispute resolution clause in this Agreement.

9.9 _Dispute Resolution_. 

(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be
finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber
of Commerce by three (3) arbitrators. If the two party-nominated arbitrators
are unable to agree on the third arbitrator who shall serve as the President
of the Tribunal within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the two
party-nominated arbitrators, the ICC Court or Secretariat shall appoint the
third arbitrator. The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York.
The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrators shall award
to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, its
reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Judgment upon any award(s) rendered by

(b) The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their
arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for
the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another
party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the

pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings
before a court or other judicial authority.
