3 Section 1.6 Effect on Capital Stock.

 

(a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any party or holder of any of their securities, subject to the
other provisions of this _Article 1_ and _Section 2.1_, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of
this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive the following
consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "): the combination of (x) $20.00
(the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ ") and (y) 1.932 shares of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Per Share Stock Consideration_ " or the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_.

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article 1_ shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock or non-certificated shares represented by book
entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger
Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_, and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.1(e)_. Each
Dissenting Share, whether represented by a certificate or book-entry, shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the payments described in
_Section 1.8_. 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be changed or proposed
to be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of the
occurrence of or record date with respect to any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefore (all such shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ ").
All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall become authorized unissued stock of Parent.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, the shares of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in the
aggregate, be converted into and become 26,000,000 validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Company.

(f) At the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, (i) each share of common
stock, par value 

 



4  $0.0001 per share, of the Company, as the Surviving Company, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
limited liability company interest of Second Merger Sub, as the new Surviving
Company, and shall constitute the only outstanding limited liability company
interests of the Surviving Company, and (ii) each limited liability company
interest of Second Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Merger Effective Time shall be canceled.

Section 1.7 Stock Options, Warrants and Restricted Stock Units.

(a) Each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that was granted pursuant to any stock
option, purchase or award plan, program or arrangement of the Company
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, and that is not then
vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable on an
accelerated basis immediately prior to the Effective Time. Immediately before
the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised shall be exercised (pursuant to an irrevocable written exercise
notice from the holder of the Company Option that is contingent only on the
Closing, the form of which shall be subject to approval by Parent and shall be
delivered by Company to Parent within 15 Business Days following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement) in accordance with the Company Stock
Plans, including on a "net cashless" basis. The Company and Parent shall
agree on the terms, conditions and manner of exercise of the Company Options
and the terms, conditions and manner of the assumption of the Company Options,
including, to the extent applicable, acceptable methods of payment of the
option exercise price and applicable withholding taxes and determination of
taxable income. As of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
issued with respect to such former Company Option shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6._ At the
Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time and for which such a written exercise
notice is not delivered to Parent within 15 Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock, and, with
respect to any such Company Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code, the option exercise price, the number
of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with Sections 422
and 424 of the Code and with respect to any such Company Option that is not
intended to be an "incentive stock option," the option exercise price, the
number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with
Section 409A of the Code.

(b) At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Warrant_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall,
in connection with the Merger, be assumed by Parent and be converted into a
warrant (an " _Assumed Warrant_ ") to acquire Parent Common Stock (the "
_Share Portion_ ") and cash (the " _Cash Portion_ ") in accordance with this
_Section 1.7(b)_. As of the Effective Time each Assumed Warrant shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of the
applicable agreement evidencing such Company Warrant, as so assumed and
converted, immediately prior to the Effective Time (including without
limitation vesting schedules and vesting commencement dates), except that:

 

(i) the Share Portion of each Assumed Warrant shall (subject to the vesting
provisions thereof) be exercisable (A) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
assumed and converted Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Per Share Stock Consideration, and rounded up to the nearest whole
share and (B) for an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to
(1) the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such assumed and converted Company Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Per Share Stock
Consideration, multiplied by (2) 0.5, and rounding up to the nearest
whole cent;

 



5 (ii) the Cash Portion of each Assumed Warrant shall (subject to the
vesting provisions of the Assumed Warrant) be exercisable (A) for that amount
of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such assumed and
converted Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Per
Share Cash Consideration, and rounded up to the nearest whole cent and (B) for
an exercise price per dollar of the Cash Portion equal to (1) the product
obtained by multiplying the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such amended and converted Company Warrant was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by 0.5, divided by (2) the Per Share
Cash Consideration, and rounded up to the nearest whole cent;

(iii) neither the Cash Portion nor the Share Portion of each unexpired and
unexercised Assumed Warrant shall be exercisable independent of the other and
the Assumed Warrant shall provide that (A) with respect to the purchase of
each share of Parent Common Stock upon exercise of the Share Portion of an
Assumed Warrant, such purchase shall be conditioned upon the holder thereof
simultaneously exercising (and, accordingly, paying the applicable exercise
price) a portion of the Cash Portion of the Assumed Warrant that is equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the Per Share Stock Consideration by the
Per Share Cash Consideration (provided that the aggregate amount of cash to be
obtained in connection with each such exercise shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) and (B), with respect to the exercise of an
Assumed Warrant for each dollar of the Cash Portion, such exercise shall be
conditioned upon the holder thereof simultaneously exercising the Assumed
Warrant to purchase an amount of shares of the Share Portion equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the Per Share Stock Consideration by the Per
Share Cash Consideration (provided that the aggregate amount of shares to be
obtained in connection with each such exercise shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share); and

 

(iv) in no event shall the Assumed Warrants be exercised for partial shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 



6 Issuances of Parent Common Stock and payments of cash upon exercise of Assumed
Warrants shall be subject to applicable withholding. Any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, other than to the extent that the
Company is contractually obligated to accelerate the vesting of any Company
Warrant, no Company Warrant shall have accelerated vesting by virtue of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement (whether alone or in
conjunction with any other event). Following the Effective Time, no holder of
a Company Warrant shall have any right to receive any shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of such Company Warrant.

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit (each, a " _Restricted
Stock Unit_ " or " _RSU_ ") which was issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Plans and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and that has
not then vested and been settled, shall vest and be settled by the Company
through the issuance to each holder thereof of one share of Company Common
Stock in respect of each such Restricted Stock Unit (subject to any applicable
withholding). As of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
issued with respect to such former Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

(d) The Company (or its Board of Directors or the appropriate committee
thereof, or the President of the Company, if applicable) shall (i) make any
amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, take all corporate action
necessary for the adjustment of Company Options, Company Warrants and
Restricted Stock Units, and take any other actions necessary or appropriate to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 1.7_,
including, without limitation, obtaining any required consents or contingent
written notice of exercise of Company Options from the holders of any Company
Options, Company Warrants and Restricted Stock Units, and (ii) shall take all
reasonable actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time,
(x) Parent will not be required to deliver any shares of the capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options, Company Warrants or Restricted Stock Units
after the Effective Time, and (y) other than as set forth in this _Section
1.7_, Parent will not be bound by any options, warrants, rights, awards
or other arrangements that would entitle any Person, other than Parent, to
beneficially own shares of Parent or receive any payments in respect of such
options, warrants, rights, awards or arrangements.

 

(e) Not later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC (i) a registration statement on Form S-3
(or other appropriate form) registering the resale of all the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Assumed Warrants, and such registration statement
shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained), as long as required
pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take such actions necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.7_, including reservation of
sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to satisfy the obligations under the
Assumed Warrants.

Section 1.8 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which
the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of
Article 113 of the CBCA as to appraisal

 



7  rights (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such share will not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Company,
of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and
in accordance with the provisions of Article 113 of the CBCA; _provided,
however_ , that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the
circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the CBCA, affirmatively
withdraws or waives such holders demand for appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares or loses his or her right to appraisal and payment for his or her
shares of Company Common Stock under Article 113 of the CBCA, (ii) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or establish such holders
entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the CBCA, (iii) if a court
of competent jurisdiction determines that any holder of Dissenting Shares is
not entitled to the relief provided in Article 113 of the CBCA, or (iv) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence
of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his or her shares
under the CBCA, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the
right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock, and such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares,
and each such share of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or
offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the
written consent of Parent.

 

ARTICLE 2

 

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 Exchange of Certificates.

_(a) Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent
and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article 2_ , through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash
and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to make pursuant
to this  _Article 2_ all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as are
required by _Article 1_. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_. The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Sections
2.1(c)_ and _2.1(e)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited
with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

 



8 _(b) Exchange Procedures_. __ Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates or
Book Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message"
with respect to Book Entry Shares, and shall be in customary form and subject
to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby. Upon
surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section 1.6_ (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by all Certificates then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount
equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and this _Article 2_ ,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant
to _Section 2.1(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be
paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.1_, each Certificate and Book
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

 

 _(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry
Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder
would be entitled to receive upon surrender thereof and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book Entry Shares
in accordance with this _Section 2.1_. Subject to

 



9  applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such holders whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such holders whole shares of Parent Common Stock.
For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of
Parent Common Stock.

_(d) Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ or 
_Section 2.1(e)_) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

_(e) Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common
Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock
split or interest shall relate to any such fractional share, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights as a holder of any shares of Parent Common Stock.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates or Book Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product of (i) the
average of the closing sale prices per share of Parent Common Stock on the
NYSE as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to  _Section 1.6_. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge
that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate
and accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

_(f) Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from
and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu
of 

 



10  fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_,
in each case, without any interest thereon.

_(g) No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

_(h) Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance
acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 

 _(i) Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

 _(j) Investment of Cash by the Exchange Agent; Return of Certain Funds_. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts
payable to Company stockholders pursuant to the other provisions of this
_Article 2_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall promptly be paid to Parent. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ to pay for
shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights shall have been
perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. The Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent, _provided_ that
such investments shall be in money market funds rated AAA by Standard and
Poors Corporation or deposit accounts provided by commercial banks rated A+
or better by Standard and Poors Corporation.

 

Section 2.2 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
any Certificates or Book Entry Shares presented to the 

 



11  Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, in each case
without any interest thereon.

Section 2.3 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers, directors and managers of the Surviving Company shall be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub, Second Merger
Sub or the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or
the Company, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
acquired or to be acquired by Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger and the Second Merger.

any of the Company Plans, any trust created under a Company Plan and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in
a transaction or has taken or failed to take any action with respect to a
Company Plan in connection with which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate would be reasonably likely to be subject to a material
civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409, 501, 502 or 510 of ERISA or a
Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975(a) or (b), 4976 or 4980B of the Code.

 

(d) Each of the Company Plans and each other (including former) benefit plan,
program, agreement, policy or arrangement has been operated and administered
by the Company and its ERISA Affiliates in all material respects in accordance
with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. With respect to each
Company Plan, all reports, returns, notices and other documentation that
are required to have been filed or furnished with the IRS, the DOL or any
other Governmental Entity, or to the participants or beneficiaries of such
Company Plans (or

 



20  their representative) have been filed or furnished on a timely basis. No
individual who has performed services for the Company or an affiliate (or the
predecessor of any such person) has been improperly included or excluded from
participation in any Company Plan. The Company, its Subsidiaries and ERISA
Affiliates have maintained all data necessary to administer each Company Plan
and such data is true and correct and maintained in usable form. The Company
and its Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have not initiated any proceedings
pursuant to the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System. The Company,
its Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have made the required payments
and filings necessary to satisfy the requirements of the DOLs Voluntary
Fiduciary Correction Program and the DOLs Delinquent Filer Voluntary
Compliance Program with respect to all returns, reports or other documentation
required to have been filed with the IRS or the DOL and that initially were
not properly filed, and there are no audits or similar proceedings pending

has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or
comply with the requirements of ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Laws
in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any
Company Plan. No current or former officer, director, Employee, leased
employee, consultant or agent (or their respective beneficiaries) of
the Company or a Subsidiary has or will obtain a right to receive a gross-up
payment from the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to any Tax that may be
imposed upon such individual pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, Section
4999 of the Code or otherwise

(e) With respect to each of the Company Plans that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, the Company has
received a currently effective determination letter from the IRS or such plan
is subject to a current IRS opinion letter stating that it is so qualified,
such letter has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect such
qualified status. No fund established under a Company Plan is intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(f) No amounts paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form
of benefits, accelerated vesting, cash, property or otherwise) under the
Company Plans as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either
alone or in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or fail to be
deductible for federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or
162(m) of the Code. _Section 3.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets
forth, with respect to each Company Employee, all payments and
benefits (whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits,
accelerated vesting, cash, property or otherwise) that would be due to such
employee under any Company Plan or other benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(g) No Company Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former
officer, director, Employee, leased employee, consultant or agent of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate after retirement or other
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law,
(ii) death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term is defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full direct cost of which is
borne by the current or former employee (or beneficiary thereof).

 



21 (h) There has been no amendment to, or written interpretation of, or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in the terms of
employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan which would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of
the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to
the date hereof. The execution of this Agreement, the stockholder approval of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with any other event,
(i) entitle any current or former Employee, leased employee, officer,
director, consultant or agent of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate to severance or termination pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment under any Company Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting of, increase the amount or value of or otherwise enhance any
benefit due any such employee, officer or director under any Company Plan, or
(iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans or terminate the
employment of any Company Employee.

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or
could become a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(j) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
Litigation by, on behalf of or against any Company Plan by any participant or
former participant (or beneficiary thereof) in such Company Plan or otherwise
involving any such Company Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of circumstances
exists that may reasonably give rise to Litigation, against the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any officer, director, Company
Employee or other service provider to the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, any ERISA Affiliate, the Company Plans, any fiduciaries of the
Company Plans with respect to their duties to the Company Plans or the assets
of any of the trusts under any of the Company Plans that could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the DOL, any
Company Plan, any participant or former participant in a Company Plan, or any
other party.

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA
Affiliates has maintained or contributed to, had an obligation to contribute
to or has any liability, whether contingent or otherwise with respect to a
plan maintained by more than one employer within the meaning of Code Section
413(c), a plan subject to ERISA Section 4063, 4064 or 4066, a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, a multiple employer
welfare arrangement within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA or any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 or 430 of the Code.

 



22 (l) All contributions required to be made under each Company Plan, as of the
date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Company Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Documents. None of the Company Plans (as applicable) has failed to
satisfy the minimum funding standard applicable under Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company has an
outstanding funding waiver. None of the Company Plans (as applicable) has
been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the
current or most recently completed plan year.

(m) All Company Plans that are subject to Section 409A of the Code are in
compliance with the requirements of such Code section and regulations and
other guidance thereunder. No Company Common Stock or other security of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates and no real property is
held in trust or otherwise set aside for funding benefit obligations under any
Company Plan.

 

(n) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates or organizations to
which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is a successor or parent corporation,
within the meaning of Section 4069(b) of ERISA, has engaged in any transaction
described in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal, in
each case except for any such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that

conducted, free and clear of any Liens (except for any Permitted Liens).

(c) The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company have made all certifications required by SOX, the Exchange Act and
any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
complete and correct. The management of the Company has completed
its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX
for the year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of SOX, without qualification, when next due.

the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or effect of such
contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published

Section 3.21 Oil and Gas.

(a) The Company has furnished Parent prior to the date of this Agreement with
reports estimating the Companys and its Subsidiaries proved oil and gas
reserves as of January 1, 2012, as prepared by Cawley, Gillespie and Associates,
Inc. (the " _Company Reserve Report_ "). To the Companys Knowledge, the
factual, non-interpretive data on which the Company Reserve Report was based
for purposes of estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth in the Company
Reserve Report (and in any supplement thereto or update thereof) was accurate
and complete in all material respects. The Company Reserve Report conforms in
all material respects to the guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. To
the Companys Knowledge, the gross and net undeveloped acreage of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as reported in the Companys most recent Form 10-K filed
with the SEC was correct in all material respects as of the date of such Form
10-K.

 

(b) The Companys (and any relevant Subsidiaries) internal proved reserve
estimates prepared by management for the year ended December 31, 2011, were
not, taken as a whole, materially lower than the conclusions in the Company
Reserve Report as of February 27, 2012. Except for changes in Laws (or
interpretations thereof) or changes generally affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change
in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

(c) All producing oil and gas wells operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and included in the Company Oil and Gas Properties have been
operated and produced and, to the Knowledge of the Company, drilled, in
accordance in all material respects with reasonable, prudent oil and gas field
practices and in compliance in all material respects with applicable oil and
gas leases and applicable Law. All producing oil and gas wells and related
material equipment are in an operable state of repair, adequate to maintain
normal operations in accordance with past practices, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

(d) All material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from
the Company Oil and Gas Properties are being received by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any
reason (except in the ordinary course of business).

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material
advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of
production to receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and,
on a net, company-wide basis, the Company is neither underproduced nor
overproduced, in either case, to any material extent, under gas balancing or
similar arrangements.

 



35 (f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have Defensible Title to the Company Oil
and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the
Company Reserve Report as attributable to interests owned or held by the
Company and its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, except for (i)
Permitted Liens and (ii) Liens associated with obligations reflected in the
Company Reserve Report, if any. The oil and gas leases and other agreements
that provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with operating rights in the oil
and gas properties reflected in the Company Reserve Report are in full force
and effect as to the oil and gas properties reflected in the Company Reserve
Report, and the rentals, royalties and other payments due thereunder have been
properly and timely paid and there is no existing default (or event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under any of
such oil and gas leases or other agreements, except, in each case, as
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company (nor, to the Companys Knowledge, an applicable operator) is in
material breach of, or default under, any oil and gas lease, oil, gas, and
mineral lease and sublease, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits
interest, mineral fee interest, carried interest, interests under a
concession, production sharing, risk service, technical service, service, or
similar agreement that is, or constitutes an interest in, the Company Oil and
Gas Properties.

(h) No claim, notice or order from any Governmental Entity or other Person
has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries due to Hydrocarbon
production in excess of allowables or similar violations that could result in
curtailment of production after the Closing Date from any unit or oil and
gas properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except any such
violations which individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not
be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

 

(i) All books, records and files of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including those pertaining to the Company Oil and Gas Properties, wells and
other assets, those pertaining to the production, gathering, transportation
and sale of Hydrocarbons, and corporate, accounting, financial and employee
records): (a) have been prepared, assembled and maintained in good faith,
and (b) to Companys Knowledge, are accurate in all material respects as they
relate to the subject matter thereof.

(j) None of the Company Oil and Gas Properties is subject to any preferential
purchase or similar right which would become operative as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Hydrocarbon Contracts
contains any rights of the other party or parties thereto to elect a new
operator on any of the material Company Oil and Gas Properties, which rights
would become operative as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company Oil and Gas Properties are not subject to any tax
partnership agreement or provisions requiring a partnership income tax return
to be filed under Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have paid all royalties, overriding royalties
and other burdens on production due by the Company and its

 



36  Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Oil and Gas Properties, except for
any non-payment of which individually or in the aggregate has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

(k) _Section 3.21(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth the lease
expirations with respect to any of the Company Oil and Gas Properties (whether
in whole or in part) that are scheduled to occur within twelve (12) months
after the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.22 Investment Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is required to be registered as an "investment company," or is a
company "controlled" by an "investment company," or an "investment adviser"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "
_Investment Company Act_ "), or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the " _Advisers Act_ ").

(b) The Company has received an opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("
_Wells Fargo_ ") to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Parent or the Company) in the Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. A correct and complete copy of the
form of such opinion has been made available to Parent. The Company has
received the approval of Wells Fargo to permit the inclusion of a copy of its
written opinion in its entirety and/or references thereto in the Proxy
Statement, subject to Wells Fargos and its legal counsels review of the
Proxy Statement and approval of any references to Wells Fargo or its written
opinion included therein.

Section 3.24 Required Vote by Company Stockholders. The affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to vote hereon (the " _Company Required Vote_ ") to approve and
adopt this Agreement is the only vote of any class of capital stock of the

consummate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisor

is solely responsible for the fees and expenses of Wells Fargo as and to the

Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or a Parent ERISA Affiliate is party, whether

the Parent Plans between Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate and the IRS, the DOL or any other Governmental Entity within the
last three years.

(c) None of Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent, any Parent ERISA Affiliate, any
of the Parent Plans, any trust created under a Parent Plan and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
transaction or has taken or failed to take any action with respect to a Parent
Plan in connection with which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate would be reasonably likely to be subject to a material civil
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409, 501, 502 or 510 of ERISA or a Tax
imposed pursuant to Section 4975(a) or (b), 4976 or 4980B of the Code.

(d) Each of the Parent Plans and each other (including former) benefit plan,
program, agreement, policy or arrangement has been operated and administered
by Parent and any Parent ERISA Affiliates in all material respects in
accordance with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. With respect to
each Parent Plan, all reports, returns, notices and other documentation that
are required to have been filed or furnished with the IRS, the DOL or any
other Governmental Entity, or to the participants or beneficiaries of such
Parent Plans (or their representative) have been filed or furnished on a
timely basis. No individual who has performed services for Parent or an
affiliate (or the predecessor of any such person) has been improperly
included or excluded from participation in any Parent Plan. Parent, its
Subsidiaries and any Parent ERISA Affiliates have maintained all data
necessary to administer each Parent Plan and such data is true and correct
and maintained in usable form. Parent and its Subsidiaries and Parent ERISA
Affiliates have not initiated any proceedings pursuant to the IRS Employee
Plans Compliance Resolution System. Parent, its Subsidiaries and Parent
ERISA Affiliates have made the required payments and filings necessary to

all returns, reports or other documentation required to have been filed with

Parents Knowledge, no other fiduciary has any liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply with the requirements of
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Laws in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any Parent

 



48  Plan. No current or former officer, director, Employee, leased employee,
consultant or agent (or their respective beneficiaries) of Parent or a
Subsidiary has or will obtain a right to receive a gross-up payment from
Parent or a Subsidiary with respect to any Tax that may be imposed upon such
individual pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, Section 4999 of the Code or
otherwise.

 

(e) With respect to each of the Parent Plans that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, Parent has
received a currently effective determination letter from the IRS or such plan
is subject to a current IRS opinion letter stating that it is so qualified,
such letter has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event
has occurred that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect such
qualified status. No fund established under a Parent Plan is intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(f) No amounts paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form
of benefits, accelerated vesting, cash, property or otherwise) under the
Parent Plans as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or fail to be deductible for
federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

(g) No Parent Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former
officer, director, Employee, leased employee, consultant or agent of Parent,
its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate after retirement or other
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law,
(ii) death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term is defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full direct cost of which is
borne by the current or former employee (or beneficiary thereof).

(h) There has been no amendment to, or written interpretation of, or
announcement (whether or not written) by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in the terms of employee
participation or coverage under, any Parent Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense
incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date
hereof. The execution of this Agreement, the stockholder approval of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i)
entitle any current or former Employee, leased employee, officer,
director, consultant or agent of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate to severance or termination pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment under any Parent Plan, or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting of, increase the amount of or otherwise
enhance any benefit due any such employee, officer or director under any
Parent Plan or terminate the employment of any Employee.

(i) To the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has
contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no Parent ERISA Affiliate or any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or could become
a liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



49 (j) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened Litigation
by, on behalf of or against any Parent Plan by any participant or former
participant (or beneficiary thereof) in such Parent Plan or otherwise
involving such Parent Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably
give rise to Litigation, against Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent, any Parent
ERISA Affiliate, any officer, director, Employee or other service provider to
Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent, any Parent ERISA Affiliate, the Parent
Plans, any fiduciaries of the Parent Plans with respect to their duties to the
Parent Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Parent Plans
that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, the DOL, any Parent Plan, any participant or former participant in a
Parent Plan, or any other party.

 

(k) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their Parent ERISA
Affiliates has maintained or contributed to, had an obligation to contribute
to or has any liability, whether contingent or otherwise, with respect to a
plan maintained by more than one employer within the meaning of Code Section
413(c), a plan subject to ERISA Section 4063, 4064 or 4066, a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, a multiple employer
welfare arrangement within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA or any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 or 430 of the Code.

(l) All contributions required to be made under each Parent Plan, as of
the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Parent Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent
SEC Documents. None of the Parent Plans (as applicable) has failed to satisfy
the minimum funding standard applicable under Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA and no Parent ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding
waiver. None of the Parent Plans (as applicable) has been required to file
information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently
completed plan year.

(m) All Parent Plans that are subject to Section 409A of the Code are in
compliance with the requirements of such Code section and regulations and
other guidance thereunder. No Parent Common Stock or other security of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates and no real property is
held in trust or otherwise set aside for funding benefit obligations under any
Parent Plan.

 

(n) Neither Parent nor any of its Parent ERISA Affiliates or organizations to
which Parent or a Parent ERISA Affiliate is a successor or parent
corporation, within the meaning of Section 4069(b) of ERISA, has engaged in
any transaction described in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

such Law or Permit; nor has any notice, charge, claim or action been received
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or been filed, commenced, or to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
alleging any violation of the foregoing, except in each case for any such
noncompliance or violation that has been resolved in all material respects or

likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any Parent Permit
will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and Parent has no Knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such
termination, modification or nonrenewal, in each case except for any such
terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in the
aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result
in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any Parent
Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewal thereof,
except in each case for any such violations, terminations, modifications

(a) _Section 4.15(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_ contains a complete and
correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all Parent Real Property
setting forth information sufficient to specifically identify such Parent Real
Property and the legal owner thereof. Parent and its Subsidiaries have good,
valid fee simple title to the Parent Owned Real Property, free and clear of
any Liens other than Permitted Liens. Each Parent Lease grants the lessee
under the Parent Lease the exclusive right to use and occupy the premises and
rights demised thereunder free and clear of any Lien other than Permitted
Liens. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to the
leasehold estate or other interest created under its respective Parent Leases
free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens. Parent has no
Knowledge of any written notice of, a proceeding in eminent domain or other
similar proceeding affecting any Parent Real Property.

(b) (i) Each Parent Lease is in full force and effect, and, to Parents
Knowledge, is enforceable against the landlord which is party thereto in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and similar Laws affecting creditors
generally and by the availability of equitable remedies), (ii) there are no
subleases under the Parent Leases and none of the Parent Leases have been
assigned, (iii) no notices of default or notices of termination have been
received by Parent with respect to the Parent Leases which have not been

(c) The Parent Real Property constitutes all the fee, leasehold and other
interests in real property held by Parent and its Subsidiaries, other than
the Parent Oil and Gas Properties. The use and operation of the Parent Real
Property in the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries does
not violate any instrument of record or agreement affecting the Parent Real
Property, except for such violations as individually or in the aggregate have
not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. No current use by Parent and its Subsidiaries of the
Parent Real Property is dependent on a nonconforming use or other
governmental approval.

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries have such rights-of-way as are sufficient to
conduct their businesses in all material respects as currently conducted,
except such rights-of-way that, if not obtained (or which, if obtained, if the
same were to expire or be revoked or terminated), would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all
its obligations with respect to such rights-of-way which are required to be
fulfilled or performed as of the date of this Agreement (subject to all
applicable waivers, modifications, grace periods and extensions) and no event
has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow,
revocation or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the
rights of the holder of any such rights-of-way, except for such revocations,
terminations and impairments that do not materially adversely affect the
commercial use of the property for the purposes for which the property is
currently being used and except for rights reserved to, or vested in, any
municipality or other Governmental Entity or any railroad by the terms of
any right, power, franchise, grant, license, permit, or by any other
provision of any applicable Law, to terminate or to require annual or other
periodic payments as a condition to the continuance of such right.

 



57 (e) All material operating equipment owned or leased by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are, in the aggregate, in a state of repair so as to be adequate

which such equipment relates in substantially the same manner in which such
Parent Oil and Gas Properties were operated immediately prior to the date
hereof.

to the benefits of, insurance covering their properties, operations,

operate. Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with the terms and provisions of such policies. With respect to any
outstanding insurance claim submitted by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
since January 1, 2010, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
written notice of any refusal of coverage or other notice that the issuer of
the applicable insurance policy or policies is not willing or able to perform
its obligations thereunder other than any such refusals or indications of
unwillingness or inability that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, none of Parent or its Subsidiaries has received
notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that substantial capital
improvements or other expenditures will have to be made in order to continue
such insurance, and all such insurance is outstanding and duly in force.

Section 4.20 Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

(a) Since January 1, 2009, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has had in
place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 of the Exchange Act) designed and maintained to ensure in all material
respects that (a) transactions are executed

 



59  in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, (b)

statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and

to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports.

 

(b) Parents disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports filed with the SEC under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Parent has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof of
internal control over financial reporting, to Parents auditors and the audit

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
Employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting. Parent has made available to the Company true and correct
copies of any such disclosures made by management to Parents auditors and
audit committee since January 1, 2009. Since January 1, 2009 through the date
hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any director, officer, Employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained
Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has

(c) The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of
Parent have made all certifications required by SOX, the Exchange Act and any

complete and correct. The management of Parent has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the
year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls
were effective. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or
circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and

 



60  chief financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of SOX, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any

partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC)), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract or arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent in Parents published financial statements or any

Section 4.21 Oil and Gas.

(a) Parent has furnished the Company prior to the date of this Agreement with
a report estimating Parents and its Subsidiaries proved oil and gas reserves
as of January 1, 2012 as prepared by Forrest A. Garb and Associates, Inc. (the
" _Parent Reserve Report_ "). To Parents Knowledge, the factual, non-
interpretive data on which the Parent Reserve Report was based for purposes of
estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth in the Parent Reserve Report
(and in any supplement thereto or update thereof) was accurate and complete in
all material respects. The Parent Reserve Report conforms in all material
respects to the guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. To Parents
Knowledge, the gross and net undeveloped acreage of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as reported in Parents most recent Form 10-K filed with SEC was
correct in all material respects as of the date of such Form 10-K.

(b) Parents (and any relevant Subsidiaries) internal proved reserve
estimates prepared by management for the year ended December 31, 2011, were
not, taken as a whole, materially lower than the conclusions in the Parent
Reserve Report as of February 7, 2012. Except for changes in Laws (or
interpretations thereof) or changes generally affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change
in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

(c) All producing oil and gas wells operated by Parent or its Subsidiaries
and included in the Parent Oil and Gas Properties have been operated and
produced and, to the Knowledge of Parent, drilled, in accordance in all
material respects with reasonable, prudent oil and gas field practices and
in compliance in all material respects with applicable oil and gas leases and
applicable Law. All producing oil and gas wells and related material equipment
are in an operable state of repair, adequate to maintain normal operations in
accordance with past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

(d) All material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from
Parent Oil and Gas Properties are being received by Parent and its
Subsidiaries in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any
reason (except in the ordinary course of business).

 



61 (e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material
advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of
production to receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and,
on a net, company-wide basis, Parent is neither underproduced nor
overproduced, in either case, to any material extent, under gas balancing or
similar arrangements.

(f) Parent and its Subsidiaries have Defensible Title to all oil and gas
properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report as attributable to interests owned or held by Parent and its
Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, except for (i) Permitted Liens
and (ii) Liens associated with obligations reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report, if any. The oil and gas leases and other agreements that provide
Parent and its Subsidiaries with operating rights in the oil and gas
properties reflected in the Parent Reserve Report are in full force and
effect as to the oil and gas properties reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report, and the rentals, royalties and other payments due thereunder have been
properly and timely paid and there is no existing default (or event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under any of
such oil and gas leases or other agreements, except, in each case, as
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent (nor, to
Parents Knowledge, an applicable operator) is in material breach of, or
default under, any oil and gas lease, oil, gas, and mineral lease and
sublease, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits interest, mineral fee
interest, carried interest, interests under a concession, production sharing,
risk service, technical service, service, or similar agreement that is, or
constitutes an interest in, the Parent Oil and Gas Properties.

(h) No claim, notice or order from any Governmental Entity or other Person has
been received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries due to Hydrocarbon
production in excess of allowables or similar violations that could result in
curtailment of production after the Closing Date from any unit or oil and gas
properties of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except any such violations
which individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(i) All books, records and files of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
those pertaining to the Parent Oil and Gas Properties, wells and other
assets, those pertaining to the production, gathering, transportation and sale
of Hydrocarbons, and corporate, accounting, financial and employee records)
(a) have been prepared, assembled and maintained in good faith, and (b)
to Parents Knowledge, are accurate in all material respects as they relate
to the subject matter thereof.

(j) None of the Parent Oil and Gas Properties is subject to any preferential
purchase or similar right which would become operative as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Hydrocarbon Contracts
contains any rights of the other party or parties thereto to elect a new
operator on any of the material Parent Oil and Gas Properties, which rights
should become operative as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and its Subsidiaries have paid all royalties, overriding
royalties and other

 



62  burdens on production due by Parent and its Subsidiaries with respect to
Parent Oil and Gas Properties, except for any non-payment of which
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

to be paid by Parent in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view,
to Parent, a signed copy of which opinion has been, or will promptly be,

entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisor or other fee or
commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent is solely responsible
for the fees and expenses of Barclays and Mitchell Energy Advisors as and to
the extent set forth in the engagement letters dated February 7, 2012 and
February 29, 2012, respectively. Parent has previously delivered to the
Company a true and correct copy of each such engagement letter, which
describes all fees payable to such Person in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all agreements under
which 

 



63  any such fees or any expenses are payable and all indemnification and other
agreements with such Persons entered into in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.26 Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of Parents Subsidiaries has
taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger in
combination with the Second Merger from constituting a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing:

 

(a) The Merger and the Second Merger will be carried out strictly in
accordance with this Agreement, and there are no other written or oral
agreements relating to the Merger and the Second Merger other than those
expressly referred to in this Agreement.

(b) In connection with the Merger, no shares of Company Common Stock will be
acquired by Parent or a Related Person for consideration other than shares of
Parent Common Stock, except for the Per Share Cash Consideration, payments to
holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, and any cash paid in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

(c) The fair market value of the Aggregate Merger Consideration will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Company Common
Stock surrendered in the exchange, determined as of the last Business Day
before the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) Other than cash paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, neither Parent nor any Related Person has any plan or intention to
redeem or otherwise reacquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

(e) Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan or
intention to adopt such a plan.

(f) Taking into account that portion of the shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged for cash (including without limitation cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash paid by the Surviving
Company with respect to Dissenting Shares), the aggregate fair market value,
determined as of the end of the last Business Day before the date of this
Agreement, of the Total Stock Consideration will not be less than
forty percent (40%) of the value, determined as of the end of the last
Business Day before the date of this Agreement, of the consideration paid to
the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time. 

(g) Neither Parent nor any Related Person owns, nor has it owned during the
past five years, any shares of stock of the Company. Neither Parent nor any
Related Person has caused any other Person to acquire stock of the Company on
behalf of Parent or a Related Person, and will not directly or indirectly
acquire any stock of the Company in connection with the Merger and the Second
Merger, except as described in this Agreement.

(h) Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or property
to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the
Company) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not made any
loan to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the
Company) in anticipation of the Merger and the Second Merger.

 



64 (i) There is no intercompany Indebtedness existing between Parent, Merger Sub
and Company that was or will be issued, acquired, or settled at a discount in
connection with the Merger and the Second Merger.

(j) Parent and Merger Sub will each pay its expenses incurred in connection
with or as part of the Merger and the Second Merger or related transactions.
Parent has not paid and will not pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses
(including transfer taxes) incurred by any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger and the Second Merger or any
related transactions. Parent has not agreed to assume, nor will it directly or
indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or
contingent, of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock.

(k) Any compensation paid to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who enter (or have entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive
contracts, if any, with Parent (a) will be for services actually rendered or
to be rendered, (b) will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties
bargaining at arms length for similar services, and (c) will not represent
consideration for the surrender of the shares of Company Common Stock in the
Merger.

 

(l) Following the Merger and the Second Merger, Parent will not take any
action and will not fail to take any action that would prevent the Merger and
the Second Merger from satisfying the "continuity of business enterprise"
requirement for a "reorganization" as provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d).

 

(m) Parent is paying no consideration in the Merger other than the Aggregate
Merger Consideration.

 

(n) Parent has substantial non-tax business purposes and reasons for the
Merger and the Second Merger, and the terms of the Merger and the Second
Merger are the product of arms length negotiations.

(o) Parent will not take any position on any Return, or take any other Tax
reporting position that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger and
the Second Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Code
Section 1313(a)(1)).

(p) No stock or securities of Parent will be issued to any Company stockholder
for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent or the Company in
connection with the Merger and the Second Merger.

(q) No stock or securities of Parent will be issued for any Indebtedness owed
to any Company stockholder in connection with the Merger and the Second
Merger.

(r) The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is
solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of
issuing fractional shares 

 



65  and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. The total
cash that will be paid in the Merger to the holders of Common Company Stock
instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed
one percent (1%) of the total consideration that will be paid in the Merger to
the Company stockholders in exchange for their Company Common Stock.

 

(s) Parent has not distributed the stock of any corporation in a transaction
satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the Code since April 23, 2010.
The stock of Parent has not been distributed in a transaction satisfying the
requirements of Section 355 of the Code since April 23, 2010.

(t) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent will be a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
Delaware.

 

(u) After the Effective Time and as part of a plan that includes the Merger
and the Second Merger, other than what Parent may sell or transfer pursuant
to _Section 5.16_, Parent will not transfer any of the former assets of the
Company to a corporation or other entity.

(v) Immediately after the Second Merger Effective Time, Parent expects that it
will continue to be treated as a USRPHC, taking into account the United States
real property owned by Company.

 

(w) Prior to the Merger, Merger Sub will be a newly formed corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
Colorado and Parent will be in control of Merger Sub within the meaning of
Section 368(c) of the Code.

(x) Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by the Company and will not
transfer to the Company any assets subject to liabilities in the Merger.

(y) Parent will be the single member and sole owner of Second Merger Sub which
will be disregarded as an entity separate from Parent under Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-2(c)(2) and its activities shall be treated in
the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch or division of Parent.
Neither Parent nor Second Merger Sub shall file an election under Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-3 to change the classification of Second Merger
Sub to other than a disregarded entity.

Section 4.27 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article 4_, neither Parent
nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of Parent or any of its affiliates in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

proposal or any offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead

this _Section 5.3(a)_ at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required
Vote if, prior to such vote, (w) the Company receives a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party, including any party with whom the
Company has an existing "standstill obligation" (and such Acquisition Proposal
was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or
other representatives and did not otherwise result from a violation by such
Persons of this Agreement or any standstill agreement), and (x) the Company
Board determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal from
the third party that made the Acquisition Proposal and that taking such
action is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, _provided_ that the Company shall not deliver any information
to such third party without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
provision that prohibits such Person from making any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company has previously disclosed or
concurrently discloses or makes available the same information, if any, to
Parent as it makes available to such third party and provides to Parent a copy
of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement that the Company entered into
with such third party. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent
required by applicable Law, _provided_ that this sentence shall not allow a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change other than in accordance with
_paragraph (b)_ below.

 



72 (b) Neither (i) the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly
or indirectly (A) fail to make, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such
committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal or any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar arrangement or agreement constituting an Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this _clause (i)_ being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") nor (ii) shall the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries execute or enter into an Acquisition Agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to _Section
5.3(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Required Vote, and subject to the Companys compliance at all times
with the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ and _Section 5.6_, the Company
Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if in response to an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, (1) the Company Board concludes in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and,
after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors,
that a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is necessary in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (2) the Company Board has
approved or concurrently approves a definitive agreement in respect of such
Superior Proposal and terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_
and otherwise complies with _Section 7.1(d)_, _Section 8.1_ and the other
provisions of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Superior Proposal or execute or enter into an
Acquisition Agreement for a Superior Proposal (x) until four Business
Days after the Company provides written notice to Parent (a " _Company
Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board or a committee thereof has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or group making such
Superior Proposal and, at the request of Parent, the Company shall negotiate
in good faith with Parent during such four Business Day period, with respect
to any alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of
this Agreement) that would allow the Company Board not to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties (it being
understood that any change in the financial or other material terms of a
Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Notice and a new four Business
Day period under this _Section 5.3(b)_).

(c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours after receipt
thereof, the Company shall advise Parent in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal received from any Person, or any request for information, inquiry,
discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
contemplated Acquisition Proposal, and the terms and conditions of such
request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to
Parent copies of any written materials received by the Company in connection
with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group making any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall simultaneously
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning itself or its
Subsidiaries provided to 

 



73  any other Person or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which
was not previously provided to Parent. The Company shall keep Parent fully and
promptly informed (and in any event within 24 hours after any change therein)
of the status of any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the
parties and price involved and any changes to any financial or other material
terms and conditions thereof). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if
it determines to engage in any actions described in _clause (ii)_ of _Section
5.3(a)_ and shall keep Parent reasonably informed in writing on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of the status and details of any such
actions. The Company agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality agreement to which it is a party or enter
into any confidentiality agreement with any Person that would restrict the
Companys ability to provide information to Parent as required in this
_Article V_.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal or offer, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that constitute 15% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets (based on the fair market value
thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
any equity securities or capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that if consummated would result in any Person or Persons
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, share
exchange, transfer of assets, recapitalization, or other business combination
or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
if consummated would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term " _Superior
Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not
initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
Employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
agents or other representatives in violation of this Agreement, made by a
third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation, asset purchase or other
business combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 50% or more of the equity securities
of the Company, in each case on terms which the Company Board determines in
good faith by resolution duly adopted (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all financial,
legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this
Agreement, including any alternative transaction (including any modifications
to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal, including any conditions to and expected timing of
consummation, and any risks of non-consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal)
to be reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed and is more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacity as
stockholders) from a financial point of view as compared to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to any alternative transaction (including any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by Parent pursuant to
this _Section 5.3_; _provided, however_ , that no proposal shall be deemed to
be a Superior Proposal if such proposal is subject to a financing condition
or 

 



74  any financing required to consummate the proposal is not fully committed
(unless it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed acquiror has adequate
financial resources to consummate the transaction).

(e) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, Employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
financial advisors, agents and other representatives to, cease and terminate
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it shall (i) take the necessary steps to promptly inform
its officers, directors, Employees, investments bankers, attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives involved in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken
in this _Section 5.3_ and (ii) request each Person who has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Persons
consideration of acquiring the Company or any material portion thereof or any
similar transaction to return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified
in writing by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by the Company or on its
behalf to the extent such request is permitted or contemplated by such
confidentiality agreement.

 

Section 5.4 Access to Information and Properties.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives of the
other party, including officers, Employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, contracts, commitments, records, data and books and personnel and,
during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other parties all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other parties may reasonably request. No
party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
and its authorized representatives, including engineers, advisors and
consultants, lenders and financing sources, upon reasonable notice and in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the business of the
applicable party or any of its Subsidiaries, may enter into and upon all or
any portion of the real property owned or leased by the other party in order
to investigate and assess, as such party reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate, the environmental condition of such real property and the other
assets or the businesses of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries (an "
_Investigation_ "). Each party hereto shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the other parties in conducting any such
Investigation, facilitating further testing or evaluation as may be reasonably
prudent with respect to matters identified in the investigation, allow any
other party reasonable access to such partys and its Subsidiaries
respective businesses, real property and other assets, together with full
permission to conduct any such

 



75  Investigation, and provide to any other party all plans, soil or surface or
ground water tests or reports, any environmental investigation results,
reports or assessments previously or contemporaneously conducted or prepared
by or on behalf of such party, its Subsidiaries, or any of their predecessors
that are in the possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, and all
information relating to environmental matters regarding such partys and its
Subsidiaries respective businesses, real property and other assets that are
in the possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries. Under the terms of
applicable operating agreements, access to Company Oil and Gas Properties and
Parent Oil and Gas Properties which are operated by third parties may require
such third-party operators prior approval and, where applicable, execution of
such third-party operators customary boarding agreement. The Company (with
respect to the Company Oil and Gas Properties) or Parent (with respect to the
Parent Oil and Gas Properties) shall, upon request of the other party (the "
_Requesting Party_ "), request the third party operators approval for the
Requesting Party to access and inspect the affected oil and gas properties.
The Requesting Party shall repair any damage to the oil and gas properties
resulting from such inspections and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the other party, its co-owners, Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims,
demands, losses, damages or causes of action arising from or relating to
the Requesting Partys inspection of the other partys oil and gas
properties, including, without limitation, claims of property damage, personal
injury or death of any person arising from or relating to the Requesting
Partys inspection, regardless of the negligence, strict liability or other
fault (but not gross negligence or willful misconduct) of the indemnified
party.

(c) Parent and the Company will hold any information contemplated under this
_Sections 5.4_ and any notices, agreements or information furnished pursuant
to _Section 5.3_ in accordance with the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of January 6, 2012 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(d) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement. 

Section 5.5 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of
the parties hereto, to obtain all necessary authorizations, consents and
approvals, and to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and to
assist Parent in obtaining any financing it may arrange in connection with
the Merger. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other parties such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other parties may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and will provide the
other parties with copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable,
file any required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") and shall respond as
promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation.

(c) Each party shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state
takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
Parent shall not be required to take any action to exempt any stockholder of
the Company from any such Law.

(d) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper
officers and/or directors of the Surviving Company shall take or cause to be
taken all such necessary action. 

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.5_, Parent
shall not be required to agree to or accept, as a condition to obtaining any
required approval or resolving any objection of any Governmental Entity, any
requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of any
other condition or restriction with respect to) any of the respective
businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
the Company Assets, the Parent Assets, the Company Real Property or the Parent
Real Property.

_Proxy Statement_ ") and Parent shall as promptly as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which
the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and the parties shall

required respectively concerning them and to respond to any comments made by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement, the S-4 and any such

77  Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and each of the Company and Parent shall as promptly as
practicable thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Parent
shall also use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective affiliates, or
its or their respective officers or directors, should occur or be discovered
by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment to the S-4
or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent shall promptly
inform the other parties hereto thereof in writing. All documents that the
Company or Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
the transactions contemplated herein will comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange

the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
its articles of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable
following the date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purposes of
voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement, a special meeting of
its stockholders for the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon

than 45 days after such date. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
5.3(b)_, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend

reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any
fact, event or circumstance as to which Parent obtains Knowledge that would
be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_.

 

(b) Immediately prior to Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with a
complete list of the number of employee terminations (other than (i)
voluntary resignations without Good Reason and (ii) terminations for cause)
for the 90-day period prior to Closing, by facility or geographic site of
employment, _provided_ that such list need not reflect the termination of any
Employee whose aggregate annual salary is less than $50,000.

Section 5.8 Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification.

(a) After the Effective Time, the organizational documents of the Surviving
Company shall contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses no less favorable than the provisions set forth in
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement to individuals who at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement and to and including the Effective Time were directors, officers and
Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the matters contemplated by this Agreement),
unless such modification is required by Law.

(b) The rights to indemnification hereunder and any indemnification agreement
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring through
the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and the Second Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect.

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to maintain directors and officers liability insurance under a policy and
with a company reasonably acceptable to the Company covering, for a period of
six years after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were
covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the
Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto
are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time), with
coverage substantially similar to such directors and officers
liability insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required
to expend pursuant to this _Section 5.8(c)_ more than an amount per year
equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the

 



79  Company for such insurance and, in the event the cost of such coverage shall
exceed that amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall purchase as much
coverage as possible for such amount. The provisions of this _Section
5.8(c)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have
been obtained by Parent or the Surviving Company for purposes of this _Section
5.8(c)_ from carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of such
insurances as of the date of this Agreement.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to
any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, under the CBCA or otherwise. The provisions of this  _Section
5.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, are expressly intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, and may not be amended or terminated
after the Effective Time in a manner contrary to the interest of
an Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Company under this _Section 5.8_ and the parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of
the Surviving Companys obligations pursuant to this  _Section 5.8_.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Company contained in this _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of Parent. In the event Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall assume and honor the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9 Publicity. Neither the Company or Parent nor any of their
respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
consultation of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with Nasdaq or the NYSE. In addition, each of the Company
and Parent agrees to consult with the other party before issuing any press
release or other announcement with respect to its business, except as may be
required by Law or by any listing agreement with Nasdaq or the NYSE if all
reasonable best efforts have been made to consult with the other party.

(a) The Company shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary, to terminate the
employment of the Company Employees identified on _Section 5.11(a)(i) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Non-Continuing Company Employees_ ") on or
before the Closing on such terms and conditions as Parent shall approve in
writing, including the payment of severance pay in exchange for a

 



80  release of claims that shall include Parent and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its affiliates
to employ any Company Employee for any length of time or upon any terms and
conditions following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or its Subsidiaries from (i)
terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of, any Company Employee
following the Effective Time or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent
any Company Plan, Parent Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that Parent or its affiliates may establish
or maintain. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the employment of a Company
Employee with Parent, or a Subsidiary of Parent who is or becomes the employer
of the Company Employees after the Effective Time, is terminated during the
one (1)-year period beginning immediately after the Effective Time, then
Parent shall, or cause a Subsidiary of Parent who is or becomes the employer
of the Company Employees after the Effective Time to, offer to such terminated
Company Employee severance benefits as set forth in a written severance plan
to be adopted by Parent, or a Subsidiary of Parent who is or becomes the
employer of the Company Employees after the Effective Time, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, which severance benefits shall be of a
form, in an amount, and on the general terms and conditions provided in
_Section 5.11(a)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_ (such plan as adopted
the " _Halc on Severance Plan_"), _provided_ that the Halcon Severance Plan
may provide for an offset to or reduction in the severance benefits, including
to zero, by the amount of any benefits an eligible Company Employee is
entitled to receive upon or in connection with the termination of employment
under any written agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary or any Company
Plan, and _provided, further_ , that the Halcon Severance Plan may exclude any
Company Employees (i) who are Non-Continuing Company Employees; (ii) who are
not employed by the Company or a Subsidiary as of the Effective Time; (iii)
who become eligible for benefits upon or in connection with the termination of
employment under any written agreement with Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent
or any other Parent Plan where such benefits, in the aggregate, are in excess
of the benefits such Company Employee otherwise would be entitled to under the
Halcon Severance Plan; or (iv) who receive a "Change in Control Payment"
under the GeoResources, Inc. Change in Control Plan. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall adopt, or cause a Subsidiary of Parent
who is or becomes the employer of the Company Employees after the Effective
Time to adopt, bonus or other incentive programs or individual agreements
designed to retain certain Company Employees after the Effective Time during a
transition period on such terms and conditions as Parent shall determine in
its sole discretion. 

(b) To the extent allowed by Law and the terms of the Parent Plans, Parent
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to take action (including, if
necessary, amending the Parent Plans) so that a Company Employees years of
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be counted for purposes of
determining years of service, eligibility, vesting and benefit levels (but
not benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan) with Parent or its
Subsidiaries with regard to employee benefits offered by Parent or its
Subsidiaries, a Company Employees years of service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall be counted. To the extent allowed by Law and the terms
of the Parent Plans, following the Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent
Plans in which any Company Employee or his or her eligible dependents is
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to take action (including, if necessary, amending the
Parent Plans) to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-
at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such condition,
exclusion,

 



81  requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company Plan as of the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan
transition date), and (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time
for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date)
occurs.

cause the Merger in combination with the Second Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and before
or after the Effective Time, none of Parent, Second Merger Sub or the Company
shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take

act could cause the Merger in combination with the Second Merger to fail to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with the record keeping and

effective by the SEC and the Effective Time, in connection with such Tax
counsels respective delivery of opinions pursuant to _Sections 6.2(d)_ and
_6.3(d)_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or

certificates described in this _Section 5.12(d)_.

 

(e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents

added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with
the Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time. Each of Parent and the Company shall pay, without deduction
from any amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and without
reimbursement from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by
any Governmental Entity, which becomes payable in connection with the Merger.

(f) Following the Merger and the Second Merger, Parent will not take any
action and will not fail to take any action that would prevent the Merger and
the Second Merger from satisfying the "continuity of business enterprise"
requirement for a "reorganization" as provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d).

 



82 Section 5.13 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take

relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
