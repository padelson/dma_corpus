THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
June 28, 2011, by and among Beacon Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation (the

subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and BJs Wholesale

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and
the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation
and their respective stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company in order
to advance the long-term business interests of the Buyer and the Company;

 

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger of
the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company, with the Company being
the survivor of such merger, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as a result of which
the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer; and 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ and the
Company have entered into an agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Company
Stockholder Agreement"), pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other
things, agreed to vote all of the shares of voting capital stock of the
Company that such stockholders own in favor of the Company Voting Proposal
(as defined below);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and
into the Company (the "Merger") at the Effective Time.

 

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
prepare, and immediately following the Closing the Company shall cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and
executed by the Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
is agreed to by the Buyer and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of
Merger (the "Effective Time").

 

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall
remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering
Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time ##### Table of Contents

  

 of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
time of Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), then the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a
Business Day during the Marketing Period specified by the Buyer on no less
than three Business Days notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the
Marketing Period (subject in each case in clause (a) and clause (b) above to
the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of all
the conditions set forth in Article VII for the Closing as of the date
determined pursuant to this proviso). For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Business Day" shall be any day on which the principal offices of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in Washington, DC are open
to accept filings other than a day on which banking institutions located in
Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by applicable Law to remain
closed. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Marketing Period" means the
first period of fifteen consecutive Business Days (i) after the Company shall
have delivered to the Buyer the Marketing Material and the Financing
Information, and such Marketing Material and Financing Information delivered
to the Buyer prior to the beginning of such fifteen consecutive Business Day
period is, and remains throughout such 15 consecutive Business Day period,
Compliant, _provided_ , that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably
believe it has delivered the Financing Information and the Marketing Material
and such Financing Information and Marketing Material is Compliant, it may
give to the Buyer a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it
completed such delivery), in which case the Company shall be deemed to have
complied with clause (i) above unless (A) at any time during such fifteen
consecutive Business Day period after the date such notice is given the
Marketing Material and the Financing Information delivered to the Buyer prior
to the beginning of such fifteen consecutive Business Day period is not
Compliant or (B) the Buyer in good faith reasonably believes the Company has
not completed the delivery of the Marketing Material and the Financing
Information or that the Marketing Material and the Financing Information is
not Compliant and, within five Business Days after the giving of such notice
by the Company, gives a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating
with specificity which Marketing Material and Financing Information the
Company has not delivered or is not Compliant), (ii) throughout and at the end
of which the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 shall be satisfied
(other than (x) the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a), which must be
satisfied no later than the final day of the Marketing Period (and if such
condition has not been satisfied by such time, the Marketing Period will be
extended until such time as such condition is satisfied), and (y) those
conditions that by their nature will not be satisfied until the Closing, which
need only be satisfied at the Closing), and (iii) throughout and at the end of
which nothing shall have occurred and no condition shall exist that would
cause any of such conditions to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were
to be scheduled for any time during such fifteen consecutive Business Day
period; _provided_ that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date
that is the date on which the Debt Financing is consummated, in which case the
Closing shall occur no later than the second Business Day after such date
(subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to
grant such waiver) of all the conditions set forth in Article VII for the

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $51.25 in cash per
share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest.

\- 3 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall deposit with the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation or another
bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through
the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount
sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Exchange Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, provided that the Buyer
shall assist the Company in developing arrangements for the delivery of such
materials at the Closing to significant shareholders of the Company to
facilitate the payment of Merger Consideration to such shareholders
immediately following the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate (other than any Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 2.2.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this
Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Buyer free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any

 



\- 4 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by
the Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
the Buyer may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock granted subject to time-based, performance or other vesting or lapse
restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (as defined in Section 2.3(b)
below) (each, a "Restricted Share"), that is outstanding and subject to such
restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically vest,
and the Companys reacquisition right with respect to each Restricted Share
shall lapse, and the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II
(including Section 2.2(f)), be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each such Restricted Share.

 

(b) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common
Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted under any stock option plans or other
equity-related plans of the Company (the "Company Stock Plans") to be
accelerated in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(ii) to cause each outstanding Company Stock Option to represent as of the
Effective Time solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section
2.3 and subject to Section 2.2(f), a lump sum cash payment in the amount of
the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect to such
Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase Company
Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.

(c) Each holder of a Company Stock Option so cancelled shall receive from the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each
such Company Stock Option, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time
(but in any event not later than three Business Days), an amount (net of
applicable taxes) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable),
without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). In the event that
the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled,
without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no
further force or effect.

 

(d) Following the execution of this Agreement, (i) if and as required by the
Company Stock Plans, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of
Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for
such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options and
(ii) the Company shall take all actions necessary or

 



\- 5 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 appropriate to terminate the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time
(including any necessary or appropriate Company Board action). The Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and
after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its
obligations to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL
(any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall, subject to Section 2.4(b),
not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL or otherwise), then the right of
the holder of such Dissenting Shares to be paid such consideration as is
determined due pursuant to the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and
shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
formerly representing such shares.

 

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice
or instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity
to control, and make decisions in respect of, all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company
shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall
have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

Companys Knowledge, is threatened, challenging the validity, enforceability,
registration, ownership or use of any such Intellectual Property. To the

misappropriating any of the Company Intellectual Property, except for
infringements, violations or misappropriations that would not have a Company

and summaries of material modification, if any, and the most recent actuarial
reports, if any, relating to such Company Employee Plan, (iv) the most recent
IRS determination letter, if applicable, and (v) for the last three years,

(c) Each Company Employee Plan is being administered in accordance with
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the regulations thereunder
and in accordance with its terms except for failures to comply or violations
that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Employee
Plan that is or forms a part of a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"

the requirements of Section 409A, or (B) has been timely amended under
guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A so that its terms and provisions
materially comply with the requirements of Section 409A; in all cases so that
the additional tax described in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code will not be
assessed against the individuals participating in any such non-qualified
deferred compensation plan with respect to benefits due or accruing

the effect that such Company Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter
has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened.

(e) Neither the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has, within the current or preceding six years, (i)

plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any (i)
agreement with any stockholders, director, executive officer or other employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of which are
contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the execution
or delivery of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement, or the
occurrence of a transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in
each case, whether alone or in combination with any other event(s)), (B)
providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing
severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of employment
of such director, executive officer or key employee; or (ii) agreement or
plan binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any stock
option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock
purchase plan or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which shall
be increased, or the vesting or payment of the benefits of which shall be
accelerated, by the execution or delivery of this Agreement, shareholder
approval of this Agreement, or the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, whether alone or in combination
with any other event(s)) or the value of any of the

 benefits of which shall be calculated or adjusted on the basis of the
execution or delivery of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement or the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether alone or in combination with any other event(s)). None of
the execution or delivery of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement or the occurrence of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (in each case, whether alone or in combination with any other
event(s)), could result in the payment of any amount that is reasonably likely
to, individually or in combination with any other payment, constitute an
"excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(g) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by
applicable Law or pursuant to and consistent with the term of severance under
individual employment, severance, retention, or change in control agreements,
each of which is set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

franchises, regulations, decrees and orders of Governmental Entities
(collectively, "Laws") with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its properties or assets, except for failures to

consummation of the Merger.

3.16 _Permits_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all material
permits, licenses and franchises (collectively, "Company Permits") from
Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as now being

a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except for such
failures to comply that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.17 _Labor Matters_. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of or, to the Companys
Knowledge, is threatened to be the subject of, any charge, claim, complaint
or proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any
labor union or labor organization that would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened labor strikes, disputes, walkouts, work stoppages, slow-downs or
lockouts involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would have
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or

immigration, workers compensation, working conditions, employee scheduling,
occupational safety and health, family and medical leave, employment and
reemployment of members of the uniformed services and employee terminations,
except for such failures to comply that would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
individual who has performed services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been improperly excluded from participation in any Company
Employee Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
direct or indirect liability, whether actual or contingent, with respect to
any misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than

with respect to any misclassification of an employee as exempt versus non-
exempt.

reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and shall not permit any

\- 28 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 similar entities with commitments thereunder that have not executed the Debt

commitment letters with respect to the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including commitments to enter into sale-

such letters do not contain any new or additional conditions precedent other
than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or that would not
adversely affect the ability of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (1) maintain in effect each Debt Commitment Letter
and negotiate Debt Financing Documents that contain terms and conditions set

or prior to the Outside Date). In the event that all conditions precedent in
a Debt Commitment Letter (other than the availability of funding of any of the
financing contemplated under the Equity Commitment Letters) have been
satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, each of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letters to fund on the Closing Date the
Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise enforce its rights under such Debt Commitment Letter
(including through litigation pursued in good faith). To the extent not done
on or prior to the date hereof, the Buyer will furnish correct and complete
copies of any Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Document to the
Company promptly upon their execution.

(b) The Buyer shall keep the Company informed upon request with respect to
all material activity concerning the Debt Financing and shall give the Company
prompt notice if it becomes aware of any material adverse change with respect
to the availability of Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, each
of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary agrees to notify the Company
promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any time prior
to the Closing Date (i) a Debt Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for
any reason (or if any person attempts or purports to terminate a Debt
Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination is
valid), (ii) the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary has actual knowledge of
any breach or default by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary receives any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any: (A) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any

among any parties to any Debt Commitment Letter; or (iv) a Financing Source
refuses in writing to provide, expresses an intent to refuse to provide, or

the Transitory Subsidiary shall, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to,
without the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter
into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint
venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing.

 

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in a Debt Commitment Letter, each of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts (i)
to arrange to promptly obtain such Debt Financing from alternative sources in
an

expenses related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this

held by the Company as of the Effective Time, to pay in cash all amounts
required to be paid by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Transitory

of the Merger (including the financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters and any Sale-Leaseback Transaction) as may be reasonably requested by
the Buyer and as customary in connection with the arrangement of financing
similar in all material respects to the Financing, provided that (i)
no liability or obligation (including any liability or obligation to pay any
commitment or other similar fee) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Effective Time and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument that
is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement
that is effective before the Effective Time) or that would be effective prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iii) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering or information document
and (iv) nothing herein shall require such cooperation with respect to any
Sale-Leaseback Transaction to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with

in all cases to the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
such cooperation shall include the following: (A) participating in a
reasonable and limited number of meetings (including customary one-on-one

Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all
conditions precedent contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 of Exhibit E to
the Debt Commitment Letter, including by providing the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or the Financing Sources or their respective representatives timely
access to any Real Property in order to take all actions necessary for the
completion of the Sale-Leaseback Documents; and (E) using reasonable best
efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and
instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff,
discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all Indebtedness
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid off, discharged and

provide to the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and their Financing Sources
such information as may be necessary so that the Financing Information, the
Sale-Leaseback Information and Marketing Material are complete and correct in
all material respects and do not and will not contain any untrue statement of

Financing if the recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements. The Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred

limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 6.1(a) by any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 6.1(a) by the Company.

(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Prior
to the Specified Time, the Company Board shall not:

 

(i) except as set forth in this Section 6.1, fail to recommend the adoption of
the Company Voting Proposal in the Proxy Statement or otherwise withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, in each case in a manner adverse to the Buyer,
the approval or recommendation by the Company Board with respect to the
Company Voting Proposal;

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement providing for the consummation of a
transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in
compliance with Section 6.1(a)); or

(iii) except as set forth in this Section 6.1, adopt, approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (any action in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may, prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Vote, (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, solely if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so could be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause (A) prior to taking the
following actions: (1) the Board of Directors of the Company shall give the
Buyer at least three calendar days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action and a description of the reasons for taking such action, (2)
upon the Buyers request, the Company shall discuss with the Buyer, and cause
its Representatives to discuss with the Buyer, in good faith and in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances giving rise to such proposed Adverse
Recommendation Change during such notice period and provide all information
reasonably requested by Buyer concerning such facts and circumstances to
facilitate the Buyers evaluation of whether to improve the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Guarantee in such a manner that would obviate the
need for the taking of such action and (3) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Guarantee proposed in writing by the Buyer, and shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change could
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law and/or (B)
if the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1 and the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement which may be offered by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.1(b), the
Company Board may, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel, that failure to take such action could be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (such agreement, an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement") and in connection therewith terminate
this Agreement pursuant Section 8.1(f); _provided_ , _however_ , that that the
Company shall not enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement and in
connection therewith terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
prior to taking the following actions: (1) the Company shall give the Buyer at
least three calendar days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action (which notice shall include an unredacted copy of the Superior
Proposal, an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
and a copy of any financing commitments

 



\- 33 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 (including redacted fee letters) relating thereto and a written summary of
the material terms of any Superior Proposal not made in writing, including any
financing commitments relating thereto), (2) upon the Buyers request, the
Company shall discuss with the Buyer, and cause its Representatives to discuss
with the Buyer, in good faith and in reasonable detail the terms and
conditions of such Alternative Acquisition Agreement during such notice
period and provide all information reasonably requested by Buyer concerning
such Alternative Acquisition Agreement to facilitate the Buyers evaluation of
whether to improve the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letters and the Guarantee in such a
manner that would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Guarantee proposed in writing by the Buyer and shall have determined that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect and (4) in the event of any material change
to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to the Buyer an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above and the notice period shall have recommenced,
except that the notice period shall be at least one calendar day (rather than
the three calendar days otherwise contemplated by clause (1) above); and
provided, further that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect, unless the Company
termination is in accordance with Section 8.1(f) and the Company pays the
Buyer the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3 prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

(c)  _Notices to the Buyer_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) advise the Buyer orally, with written confirmation to follow,
of the Companys receipt of any written Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms and conditions (including any modifications or amendments thereto) of
any such Acquisition Proposal (including financing terms and conditions),
including the identity of the person or entity making such Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 or
in Section 6.7 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 or if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so
disclose could be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law, from
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders; provided that any such
disclosure other than (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement in
accordance with the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder
or (ii) an express rejection of any Acquisition Proposal (other than the
Merger) or an unqualified reaffirmation of the recommendation by the Board
with respect to the Company Voting Proposal, shall (in the case of any
disclosure not specified by the foregoing clause (i) or clause (ii)) be deemed
to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct
its Representatives to, (i) cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request that any non-public information shared
with any other person pursuant to the process that resulted in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be returned or destroyed in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement governing such
non-public information and (iii) immediately cease access to any person (other
than the Buyer and its Affiliates) to any electronic data room maintained by

consider in good faith including in such responses all comments reasonably
proposed by the Buyer in respect of the filings and (z) shall provide the
Buyer and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any material

upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does
not disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as the Buyer shall
reasonably request, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to, nor shall the Company be required to cause it Subsidiaries to,
afford access, or disclose any information, (a) except as otherwise provided
by Section 6.1, in connection with or related to (i) an Acquisition Proposal
or (ii) the withholding, withdrawal or modification, in a manner adverse to

of the

 



\- 35 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company (after consultation with, and upon the advice of, outside counsel,
and after providing to the Buyer notice of such judgment and the facts and
circumstances of such judgment (including a general description of the
subject matter of such information)) would (i) result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties, (ii) violate any obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality, (iii) jeopardize
protections afforded the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, or (iv)

6.5 _Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all actions in

and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to promptly and duly call, give

Voting Proposal by the stockholders of the Company and include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (b) the Company Board shall
not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer, the recommendation of the
Company Board that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company

pursuant to Section 6.1, the Company shall take all action that is both
reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of
the Company required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or the DGCL
to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to
provide any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders in advance of the Company Meeting (solely in the event that such
supplement or amendment is determined by the Company in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, to be required by applicable Law) or, if as
of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting in favor to
approve the Company Voting Proposal or to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Meeting.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
that, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section
8.1 and, to the extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company
pays to the Buyer the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section

obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting
shall not be affected by an Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays to the
Buyer the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b) or the
Expense Reimbursement in accordance with Section 8.3(c), the Company agrees
that it shall not submit to the vote of the Companys stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote
of the Companys stockholders with respect to the Company Voting Proposal at
the Company Meeting.

6.6  _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section
6.6(b), the Company, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to:

advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. Each of the Company,
the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts
to furnish to each other all information required for any application or
other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law (including all information required to be included in the Proxy
Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that nothing in this
Section 6.6(a) shall limit their obligations under the other provisions of
this Section 6.6.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for the Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign Law designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), to
respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law,
and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law.

(c) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to give (or to cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any
notices to third parties other than Governmental Entities, and use, and cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain any consents from third parties other than Governmental Entities
required in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as
the case may be (or that would be required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter if any materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualifiers in the representations and warranties of the Company were
disregarded), or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect prior to or after the Effective Time, it being
understood that neither the Company nor the Buyer shall be required to make
any payments in connection with the fulfillment of its obligations under this
Section 6.6(c).

 

6.7 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or stock market
regulations, the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement

\- 37 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 by the Company and the Buyer. Each of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other parties before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement (including if
such public statement is required by applicable Law or stock markets
regulations). The restrictions set forth in this Section 6.7 shall not apply
to any communication made by the Company regarding an Acquisition Proposal or
the withholding, withdrawal or modification of the approval or recommendation
by the Company Board with respect to the Company Voting Proposal.

 

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and
hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, while a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefore;
provided that such advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to
the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to
repay all amounts so advanced if a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that such Indemnified Party did not act in good faith or in a manner that such
Indemnified Party believed to be in the best interest of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Buyer shall cause the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company.

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective
Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 300%,
the "Maximum Premium"). If the Companys existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance. At the Companys
option, the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the

 



\- 38 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 Effective Time. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

(d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section
6.8.

 

(e) The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in
any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by Law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. The obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Party, or any person who is a
beneficiary under the policies referred to in this Section 6.8 and their heirs
and representatives, without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person.

 

(f) If the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the
Buyer, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be set forth in
this Section 6.8.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of such party (or, in the case of the Buyer,
the Transitory Subsidiary) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) (with respect
to representations and warranties made by the Company) or Section 7.3(a) (with
respect to representations and warranties by the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary) would not be satisfied, in each case at any time from and after
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any failure of
such party (or, in the case of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary) to
perform in all material respects any obligation to be performed by it under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.9 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

6.11 _Service Credit_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give each employee of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or
their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Buyer
Employee Plans (as defined below), and (b) determination of benefit levels
under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan), in each case for which the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered
participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits or was not recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of any comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In
addition, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or
cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations were waived under any
comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and recognize
for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical
and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing
Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, to the same
extent such payments were recognized under any comparable plan of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Buyer
Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written plan, agreement or arrangement
involving direct or indirect compensation or benefits, including insurance
coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation,
bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, restricted stock unit, stock
appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement

\- 44 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

In the event that the Buyer shall receive full payment of the Company
Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement, the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement, together with any reimbursement
owed pursuant to Section 8.3(e), shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and

any or all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or any other person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
other claim, action or proceeding against the Company, any of its Affiliates
or any other Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. For the avoidance of doubt (1) under no circumstances will the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary be entitled to amounts in excess of the
amount of the Company Termination Fee (and any payment pursuant to Section
8.3(e)) and (2) while the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary may pursue both
a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.10 and the
payment of the Company Termination Fee under Section 8.3(b) plus Expense
Reimbursement under this Section 8.3(c), under no circumstances shall the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing and any portion of the
Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not
the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of
this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of
different events. For purposes of Section 8.3(b), all references to "20%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%". Any Company Termination Fee due shall be paid to the Buyer by wire
transfer of same-day funds (x) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(d), Section 8.1(e)(v) or Section 8.1(g), within
two Business Days after the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal
triggering the obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee, (y) if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (other than Section
8.1(e)(v)), within two Business Days after the date of termination of this
Agreement or (z) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
prior to or concurrently with such termination. Any Expense Reimbursement
shall be paid to the Buyer by wire transfer of same-day funds within two
Business Days following delivery to the Company of an invoice therefor if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d), Section 8.1(e)(v) or
Section 8.1(g).

 

(d) _Buyer Termination Fee_. The Buyer shall pay the Company a termination fee
of One Hundred and Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($175,000,000) (the "Buyer
Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(h) or Section 8.1(i).

In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee, the receipt of the Buyer Termination Fee, together with any
indemnification or reimbursement owed pursuant to Section 5.4(d) or Section
8.3(e), shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shareholders against the Buyer
and the Transitory Subsidiary and each of their respective former, current or
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees and any and all former, current
or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, management
companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the
foregoing, and any and all former, current or future heirs, executors,

 Party", and collectively, the "Buyer Related Parties") and no Buyer Related
Party shall have any other liability or obligation for any or all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other person in connection
with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and neither the Company nor any other person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding
against the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other Buyer Related Party
arising out of this Agreement, any Commitment Letter or the Guarantee, any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for
such termination. For the avoidance of doubt (1) under no circumstances will
the Company be entitled to amounts in excess of the amount of the Buyer
Termination Fee (and any payment pursuant to Section 5.4(d) or Section
8.3(e)) and (2) while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with Section 9.10 and the payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee under this Section 8.3(d), under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in a Closing and any portion of the Buyer Termination
Fee. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Buyer be required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Buyer Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. Any Buyer Termination Fee due shall be paid to
the Company by wire transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after
the date of termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to
obtain the payment, the Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the other party for the payment set
forth in this Section 8.3, such paying party shall pay the other party or
parties, as applicable, its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received. Other than an order
of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.10, any indemnification
or reimbursement owed pursuant to Section 5.4(d) and the fees and expenses
described in this Section 8.3(e), payment of the Buyer Termination Fee or the
Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with
any termination of this Agreement.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval,
no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or
waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

of equity securities issued by the Company to receive the consideration set
forth in Article II (with respect to which such holders shall be third party
beneficiaries), (ii) as provided in Section 6.8 (with respect to which the
Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries) and (iii) the rights
of the Financing Sources or their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
controlling persons, advisors, agents, attorneys and representatives set
forth in Sections 8.3(d), 8.3(e), 9.10(e), 9.11 and 9.12 (with respect to
which each Financing Source and each such person shall be a third-party
beneficiary), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement
of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary hereto. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.5 without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

(b) Other than with respect any Retained Claim, no recourse shall be had by
the Company, any of its Affiliates or any person purporting to claim by or
through any of them or for the benefit of any of them under any theory of
liability (including without limitation by attempting to pierce a corporate,
limited liability company or partnership veil, by attempting to compel the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to enforce any rights that they may have
against any person, by attempting to enforce any assessment, or by attempting
to enforce any purported right at Law or in equity, whether sounding in
contract, tort, statute or otherwise) against the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or any other Buyer Related Party in any way under or in connection
with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Guarantee or any
other agreement or instrument delivered in connection with this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letters, the Guarantee, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract,
tort, statute or otherwise). The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, institute any proceeding or
bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement,
the Equity Commitment Letters, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
thereby (whether at Law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort,
statute or otherwise), against the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any
Buyer Related Party except for claims that the Company may assert: (i)
against any Buyer Related Party that is party to, and solely pursuant to the
terms of, the Confidentiality Agreements; (ii) against the Investors (and
their legal successors and assigns of

 



\- 48 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 their obligations hereunder) under, and pursuant to the terms of, the
Guarantee (subject in each case to each such Guarantors Cap (as defined in
the Guarantee)); (iii) against an Investor for specific performance of such
Investors obligations under its Equity Commitment Letter to fund its
commitment thereunder in accordance with and pursuant to Section 5 thereof;
and (iv) against the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary in accordance with
and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the claims described in clauses
(i) through (iv) collectively, the " _Retained Claims_ ").

 

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. No summary
of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such person, and
the exercise by a person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.10(b) or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
enforce specifically the obligations of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the
Closing only in the event that (i) all conditions set forth in Sections 7.1
and 7.2 have been satisfied (other than delivery of items to be delivered at
the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) at the time Section
1.3 contemplated the Closing to occur, (ii) the Debt Financing has been
funded or the Debt Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that the Debt
Financing will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the
Closing to occur. 

(d) If a court has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary (in a final, binding determination where
all available appeals have been exhausted) to take all actions under this
Agreement up to and including the consummation of the Closing pursuant to a
claim for specific performance brought against the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 9.10, then the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company Related Parties will be payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in
accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 8.3. In addition, the
Company agrees to, and to cause the Company Related Parties to, cause any
action or claim pending in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any action or claim related to the
Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Guarantee) by
the Company or any Company Related Party against the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates to be dismissed with
prejudice promptly, and in any event on or prior to the time the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary consummate the Merger pursuant to this Section 9.10.

(e) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or nature (whether in law or in equity) against a Financing Source (and/or any
of their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
advisors, agents, attorneys or representatives) relating to this Agreement or
the Debt Financing other than in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof).

 

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any
such court, (c) agrees 

 



\- 50 -  ##### Table of Contents

  

 that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other person with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing
in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any person to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST A FINANCING SOURCE AND/OR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTROLLING PERSONS, ADVISORS,
AGENTS, ATTORNEYS AND REPRESENTATIVES) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER; (C) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

 

9.13 _Disclosure Letters_. The Company Disclosure Letter and the Buyer
Disclosure Letter shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the
numbered Sections contained in this Agreement. The disclosure in any Section,
whether related to representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, shall
qualify the corresponding Section of this Agreement. The disclosure in any
Section of this Agreement in Article III or Article IV shall qualify each
other Section in Article III or Article IV to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies
to such other Sections; provided, that in no event shall any disclosure in
any other Section qualify the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.7(b)(i). The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter, or in any update thereto, shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

9.14 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Companys Knowledge" means the actual knowledge as of the date hereof of the
individuals identified in Section 9.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter.
