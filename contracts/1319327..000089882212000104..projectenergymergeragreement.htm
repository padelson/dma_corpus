Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing (the " _Exchange

Consideration (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger Consideration for
exchange in accordance with this Agreement.

  

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record (collectively, the "
_Holders_ ") of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock ("
_Certificates_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent and Parent) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for
the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate.

  

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s),
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company
Common Stock will be entitled to receive, promptly after the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only
the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or
distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

  

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of Company, the Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such
Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a person other than the registered Holder of the Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary    of the
Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Holder of Company Common Stock (including with respect
to any Dissenting Shares) such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the
case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment; provided that any
transfer or other similar Taxes payable in connection with the Merger (other
than such Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered Holder of the Company
Common Stock with respect to which such payment is made) shall be borne and
paid by Parent and Merger Sub. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by
the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
applicable Tax authorities, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

  

  

5

       

  

  



     

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.7 and the procedures set forth in this Article II.

  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent; _provided _ that to the extent at any time prior to
such first anniversary any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
would have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, the Exchange Agent shall first
notify Parent and, at Parent's option, such portion shall instead be paid to
Parent. Any former shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. None of Parent, Company,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

  

(f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(g) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement,
Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to
make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of any Letter of    Transmittal and compliance
by any Company shareholder with the procedures and instructions set forth
herein and therein and (ii) the method of payment of the Merger Consideration.

(h) In the case of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make such
adjustments to Article I and Article II as are necessary or appropriate to
implement the same purpose and effect that Article I and Article II have with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock that are represented by
Certificates.

insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries
or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

  

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer or director of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under a Company Benefit Plan, or result in
any limitation on the right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit
Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an

Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefits Plans or the
assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans, in each
case, which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the " _PBGC_ "), the United States Department of the Treasury,
the United States Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party.

with, and are not and have not been in violation of, any applicable Law,
except in each case where the failure to hold such license, registration,
franchise, certificate, variance, permit or authorization or such
noncompliance or violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received
notice of, any violations of any of the above, except for such violations that

Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account that would have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

16

or other Laws affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally or
(b) the rules governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other equitable remedies and general principles of equity,

as amended (" _Environmental Laws_ "). 

  

(b) There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims or actions pending, or, to the Knowledge of Company,
threatened against Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there is no claim for coverage by Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of such Company Policies as to
which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of
such Company Policies or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved
their rights. Each Company Policy is in full force and effect and all
premiums payable by Company or its Subsidiaries have been timely paid, by
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice of any threatened termination of,
material premium increase with respect to, or material alteration of coverage

reserves have been established), (B) Liens for real property Taxes not yet due
and payable, (C) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that

subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties ((A) through (C) collectively, " _Permitted
Encumbrances_ ") and (ii) has good and marketable leasehold interests in all
parcels of real property leased to Company reflected in the Balance Sheet (the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Company, any other
Person, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in sole possession of the
properties purported to be leased thereunder, subject and pursuant to the
terms of the leases, subleases, licenses or other contracts (including all
amendments, modifications and supplements thereto) (the " _Real Property
Leases_ "). Since the Balance Sheet Date, none of the Leased Premises or
Owned Real Property has been taken by eminent domain (or to the Knowledge of
Company is the subject of a pending or contemplated taking which has not been
consummated).

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.20(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, no Person other than Company and its Subsidiaries has (i) any right
in any of the Owned Real Property or any right to use or occupy any portion of

amendment and there exists no default or event of default or event,
occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Company or its Subsidiaries or,
to the Knowledge of Company, with respect to the other parties thereto, and

and records and personnel of Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall
reasonably request, which access shall occur during normal business hours and
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided _ that
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
provide such information or access to the extent that doing so would violate
applicable Law or any contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party or result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, in which case
the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements. 

  

(b) Parent and Company shall comply with, and shall cause their
respective Representatives, directors, officers and employees to comply with,
all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
set forth therein.

  

6.3 _SEC Filings and Shareholder Approval_. 

  

(a) Company shall as promptly as practicable prepare and file
with the SEC a mutually acceptable proxy statement relating to the Company
Shareholders Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ "), (ii) respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
such filing and will provide copies of such comments to Parent promptly upon
receipt, (iii) as promptly as reasonable practicable, prepare and file (after
Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on) any
amendments or supplements necessary to be filed in response to any SEC
comments or as required by applicable Law, (iv) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC, and will thereafter mail to its
shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Proxy Statement and
all other customary proxy or other materials for meetings such as the Company
Shareholders Meeting, (v) to the extent required by applicable Law, as
promptly as reasonably practicable prepare, file and distribute to the Company
shareholders any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement if any event
shall occur which requires such action at any time prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting. The Proxy Statement, and any amendment or supplement
thereto, shall, except in the case of a withdrawal or modification of the
Company Board Recommendation expressly permitted by Section 6.3(b), include
the Company Board Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate with Company in
connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including
furnishing Company upon request with any and all information regarding Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective affiliates, the plans of such    Persons for
the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, and all other matters and
information as may be required to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement
under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements thereto, or any SEC
comments received with respect thereto, prior to filing the same with the SEC.

  

  

31

       

  

  



     

(b) Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
the TBOC and the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as
promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder
Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Company Shareholders Meeting_ "), and, except in the case of a withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation expressly permitted by this
Section 6.3(b), shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
the Requisite Shareholder Approval thereat. Except as expressly provided in
the immediately following sentence, the board of directors of Company shall
(i) recommend to its shareholders the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "),
(ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii)
not approve, agree to or recommend, or propose to approve, agree to or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction. The board of
directors of Company shall be permitted (x) not to recommend to Company's
shareholders that they give the Requisite Shareholder Approval or (y) to
otherwise withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation, in each case only (A) if after receiving an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of
directors of Company determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving
the advice of outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal,
the board of directors would be in violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law if it failed to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) after the third Business Day following delivery by Company
to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the board of directors of
Company intends to resolve to so withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation absent modification of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, which notice shall specify the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, and, include
a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and all other material documents; (C) if, assuming this
Agreement was amended to reflect all adjustments to the terms and conditions
hereof proposed by Parent during such three Business Day period (during which
period Company has negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) with respect to such adjustments), such Acquisition
Proposal would nonetheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (D)
if Company has complied with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.3(b)
and Section 6.8; _provided_ , _however_ , that following each and every
material revision to such Superior Proposal, Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent in accordance with this Section 6.3(b)
and to again comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(b); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (1) nothing in this Section 6.3(b) shall be interpreted to
excuse Company and its board of directors from complying with its unqualified
obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the Company
Shareholders Meeting and (2) Company shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction other than
the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, if the board of directors of the
Company has withdrawn or    modified the Company Board Recommendation as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.3(b), then the board of directors of
Company may submit this Agreement to Company's shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of
directors of Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to Company's shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means
a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that (x) is obtained not
in breach of this Agreement for all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, on terms that the board of directors of Company determines in
its good faith judgment (after taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement),
including any break‑up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
and expected timing and risks of consummation, the form of consideration
offered and the ability of the party making such proposal to obtain financing
for such Acquisition Proposal, and after taking into account all other legal,
financial, strategic, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including
the identity of the party making such proposal, and this Agreement) are more
favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger,
and (y) is reasonably likely to receive all necessary regulatory approvals and
be consummated.

  

  

32

       

  

  



     

6.4 _Public Disclosure_. Parent and Company agree that the press
release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a
joint release of Parent and Company. Thereafter, Company and Parent will
consult with and provide each other the reasonable notice of any press release
or other public (or non-confidential) statement or comment prior to the
issuance of such press release or such other statement or comment relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any
such press release or such other statement or comment prior to such notice
except as may be required by applicable Law. In addition, Company shall not
issue any such press release or such other statement or comment without the
prior approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law.

  

6.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

(a) From the Closing Date through the first anniversary
thereof, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to employees who are
actively employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ "), while such Covered Employees
continue in the employment of Parent or its subsidiaries, annual base salary,
incentive compensation opportunities (other than any equity-based incentive
compensation opportunities) and severance benefits that are at least equal to
the Covered Employees' annual base salaries, incentive compensation
opportunities (other than any equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities) and severance benefits as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (with respect to severance benefits under the Encore Bank
Change in Control Severance Policy (HR-36) as reflected in the Company's
Employee Handbook (as amended in the manner set forth on Section 5.2(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule)), and from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall
maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans (other than defined
benefit retirement plans to the extent that participation in such plans is not
available to newly hired employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date) for the    benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee
benefits (other than defined benefit retirement benefits to the extent that
such benefits are not available to newly hired employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date) that are the same as the employee
benefits that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries), as
applicable, on the Closing Date.

  

  

33

       

  

  



     

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such
employee benefit plan to recognize the service of such Covered Employee with
Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation,
vesting and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was recognized
immediately prior to the Effective Time under a corresponding Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided _ that such recognition of service
shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with
respect to the same period of service, (ii) apply for purposes of any retiree
medical plans or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement
(A) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do
not receive credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to
any health care plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company
and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to
participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, Parent shall (x) cause any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary
plan (excluding any Company Benefit Plan) to be waived with respect to such
Covered Employee to the extent that such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any
health care expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that
includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding
any Company Benefit Plan).

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, the
provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,    Company and
its Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.

  

  

34

       

  

  



     

6.6 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Company and Parent agree to cooperate fully with
each other and to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of
Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other) or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall,
at Parent's sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

  

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Date, in the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in
which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the
request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another Person (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "), is, or is threatened to be,
made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or
(ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or
articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents),
and any existing indemnification agreements set forth in Section 6.7 of the
Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such
individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
or taken at the request of Parent, _it _ _being _ _understood _ that
nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the same and fullest extent a Texas or Delaware
corporation is permitted to indemnify its officers and directors by applicable
Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses
to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of
or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of Company or any Subsidiary of Company, and    pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after,
the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Parent.

  

  

35

       

  

  



     

(c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Company or any Subsidiary of Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time
by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by
Company ( _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of
250% of the annual premiums currently paid by Company (which current amount is
set forth in Section 6.7(c) of the Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance
(the " _Insurance Amount_ "), _provided_ , _further_ , that if Purchaser is
unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the
preceding proviso, Purchaser shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for the Insurance Amount; _provided,_ _further_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage, Purchaser may direct Company to purchase a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" that provides coverage no less favorable than
the coverage described above; _provided,_ _further_ , that if the annual
premiums for such "tail" policy exceed the Insurance Amount, then Purchaser
may direct Company to obtain a "tail" policy with the maximum coverage
available for the Insurance Amount applied over the term of such policy.

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and representatives.

  

6.8 _No Solicitation_. 

  

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
retained representatives or agents (each, a " _Representative_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action
designed to facilitate, any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share
exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock
(including, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an
Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being
referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any
Alternative Transaction or Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the event that (x) Company shall receive a Superior Proposal that was
not solicited by it and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Agreement and (y) prior to receipt of the Required Shareholder Approval, the
board of directors of Company determines in its good faith judgment, after
receiving the advice of outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Proposal, if Company    fails to participate in such discussions or
negotiations with, or provide such information to, the party making the
Superior Proposal, the board of directors of Company would be in violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, Company may (A) furnish information
with respect to it and its Subsidiaries to the party making such Superior
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms no
less restrictive to the party making the Superior Proposal than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that a copy of all
such written information is simultaneously provided to Parent, and (B)
participate in discussions regarding such Superior Proposal. _ _

  

  

36

       

  

  



     

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ "
means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of
persons) other than Parent or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires
or would acquire more than twenty-five (25) percent of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock or outstanding voting power of the Company, or more
than twenty-five (25) percent of the outstanding shares or voting power of any
other series or class of capital stock of the Company that would be entitled
to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from Company, or
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger,
share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving Company
(other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person
(or group of persons) other than Parent or its Affiliates acquires or would
acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of any Company Subsidiaries and securities of the entity surviving
any merger or business combination involving any Company Subsidiary) of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than twenty-five (25)
percent of the fair market value of all the assets, deposits, net revenues or
net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction or (iv) any other consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least
seventy-five (75) percent of each of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in
such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially
the same proportion as such holders held the shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the consummation thereof.

  

(c) Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than one Business Day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or
any request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that has made, or to Company's knowledge
may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent
shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering
making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access
to the books and records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment
to an Acquisition Proposal. Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes
or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request.

  

  

37

       

  

  



  

(d) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to,
release any third party from, and agrees to enforce, the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which Company or its Subsidiaries is
a party that remains in effect as of the date hereof, and shall immediately
take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been
heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
board of directors of Company from disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement; and _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that any such disclosure (other than
a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a modification of
the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent unless the
board of directors of Company expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation.

presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Company:

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Company and Parent;

  

(b) by either Company or Parent, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the End Date __ ( _provided _ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to
