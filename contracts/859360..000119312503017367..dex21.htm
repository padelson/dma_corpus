ARTICLE II



CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES



SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock") or any capital stock of Merger Sub:



 

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Subject to this Article II, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be
converted



 

2 into the right to receive 0.9 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(b)). All
such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), all to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest (collectively, the "Merger
Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split,
reclassification, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or having a record date)
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or
(ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of
Parent, shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no securities
of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any
party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (A) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party
is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership
interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not
have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership), (B) such party or
any Subsidiary of such party owns in excess of a majority of the outstanding
equity or voting securities or interests or (C) such party or any Subsidiary
of such party has the right to elect at least a majority of the board of
directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization.



(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(d) _Stock Options and Purchase Rights_. Outstanding options to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated in the manner set forth in
Section 6.10 hereof. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock under the ESPP (as defined below) shall be treated in the manner set
forth in Section 5.4 hereof.



SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates._  



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a



 

3 bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange
Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, stock certificates representing the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange
for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, which shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time. From time to
time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash to
make all cash payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.2(d).



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right
to receive in accordance with Section 2.1(a) in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(c), and (C) any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d), after
giving effect to any tax withholdings required by applicable law, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective
Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the
right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.



(c) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Parent Shares_ _._ No dividends
or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock for which
the record date is after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock such holder is entitled to receive until



 

4 such holder surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.



(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder and
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the
average of the last reported sales prices of Parent Common Stock at the 4:00
p.m., New York City time, end of regular trading hours on the New York Stock
Exchange during the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day prior to the Effective Time.



(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or have
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Parent Common Stock which
had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which has not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar law) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock upon due
surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither
Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar law following the passage of time specified therein.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any person who was a holder of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent is required to



 

5 deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.



(h) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_ _._ At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_ _._ In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common
Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a) as well as the other
Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II; provided, however _,_
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form satisfactory
to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(j) _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance with
this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and directors
of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.



SECTION 2.3 _Material Adverse Effect_.



(a) The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or
circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other such
similar or related changes, effects or circumstances that have occurred prior
to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse
Effect, (i) is materially adverse to the business, assets (including
intangible assets) and liabilities (taken together when the change, effect or

6 (ii) would reasonably be expected to prevent the Company from consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that none of the
following shall be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A)

the Company; (B) any change or event resulting from compliance with the terms

or pendency of the Merger that impacts the Companys or any of its
Subsidiarys revenues or relationships with its employees, customers,
suppliers or partners.



(b) The term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or
circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other such

Effect, (i) is materially adverse to the business, assets (including
intangible assets) and liabilities (taken together when the change, effect or
circumstance impacts both assets and liabilities), financial condition or
results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii)
would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent from consummating the

Adverse Effect: (A) any change or event attributable to conditions affecting
the industries in which Parent participates or the U.S. economy as a whole,
provided that such change or event does not have a substantially
disproportionate impact on Parent; (B) any change or event resulting from

SECTION 3.4 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Subject only to the
approval of the Companys stockholders as described below, the Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and each instrument required hereby to be executed and delivered by it at the
Closing and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement and each instrument required hereby to be executed
and delivered at the Closing by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
subject only to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Companys stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as required by the GCL and the
Company Charter. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
As of the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has
unanimously determined that it is fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of the Companys stockholders for the Company to enter into a
business combination with Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, and has unanimously recommended that the Companys
stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and



 

10 the Merger, and, unless notice thereof has been given to Parent in the manner
required by this Agreement, none of the aforesaid actions by the Companys
Board of Directors has been amended, rescinded or modified. The action taken
by the Companys Board of Directors constitutes approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby by the Companys Board of Directors
under the provisions of Section 203 of the GCL such that Section 203 of the

the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates have in
all material respects met their obligations with respect to each Company
Employee Plan and have timely made all required contributions thereto. All

there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any plan participant could
be subject to any material liability (including penalties or taxes) under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law, nor will the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement give rise to any such liability.



(d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, there are no material benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the

or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.



(h) Each Company Employee Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the
Company and any of the Companys Subsidiaries party thereto or covered
thereby at any time without liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result thereof, and no Company Employee Plan or related plan

and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) and the amount by which the
present value of benefits accrued under each such Company Employee Plan
exceeds the fair market value of the assets of each such Company Employee
Plan.



(j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or, to the
knowledge of the Company, investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, with respect to any Company Employee Plan, other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course, that would reasonably be expected
to result in material liability to the Company or to such Company
Employee Plan. No Company Employee Plan is or, to the knowledge of the
Company, within the last three calendar years has been, the subject of,

organize any such employees; and (d) there are no and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any labor disputes, strikes,
slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or threats thereof, by or with respect to

any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any term of any patent
disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant
to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of

information of others or, in the case of any key employee or group of key
employees, has given notice as of the date of this Agreement to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that such employee or any employee in a group of
key employees intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company.
Since the Companys inception, neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has effected (i) a plant closing, as defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retaining Notification Act of 1988, as amended ( the "WARN Act"), or (ii) a
mass layoff as defined in the WARN Act. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently engaged in any layoffs or employment terminations

not materially detract from the value or impair the use of the property or
assets subject thereto. Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of all real property owned, leased, subleased
or licensed by the Company and the location of such premises. Each of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with the

waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a
period for the assessment of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes
(exclusive of any accruals for "deferred taxes" or similar items that reflect
timing differences between tax and financial accounting principles) reflected
in the Company Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable
through the date thereof (including interest and penalties, if any, thereon

or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 is set forth on Section 3.16(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule. No state or federal "net operating loss" of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries determined as of the Closing date is subject to
limitation on its use pursuant to Section 382 of the Code or comparable
provisions of state law as a result of any "ownership change" within the
meaning of Section 382(g) of the Code or comparable provisions of any state

any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal or in any jurisdiction
alleging that the activities or the conduct of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries business infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property
owned by any third party ("Third Party Intellectual Property"), or challenging
the ownership, validity, enforceability or registerability of any Company
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company is not, as a result of any suits, actions or similar legal
proceedings, a party to any settlements, covenants not to sue, consents,
decrees, stipulations, judgments, or orders which (i) materially restrict the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights to use any Company Intellectual

(e) Except with respect to unpublished patent applications of third parties,
foreign patent applications and unregistered trademarks of third parties, with
respect to which the Company represents and warrants only to its knowledge,
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently

misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any Company Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently

dilution or violation suits, arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings

against any third party by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which remain
unresolved.



(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to
protect the proprietary nature of the Company Intellectual Property that is
(i) owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) material to the

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of material confidential information or
trade secrets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related to any
material proprietary product currently being marketed, sold, licensed or
developed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such product, a
"Proprietary Product") other than disclosures made pursuant to nondisclosure
or confidentiality agreements entered into by the Company in the ordinary
course of business.



(g) All employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have made material
contributions to the development of any Proprietary Product (including without
limitation all employees who have designed, written, tested or worked on any

Proprietary Product to the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries) all of
their right, title and interest (other than moral rights, if any) in and to
the portions of such Proprietary Product developed by them in the course of
their work for the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries (or applicable
third party). Assignments of the patents and patent applications listed in
Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the Company or one or more of
its Subsidiaries have been duly executed and filed with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office.



 

25 (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted or is
obligated to grant access to any of its source code, (including without
limitation in any such case any conditional right to access or under which the
Company has established any escrow arrangement for the storage and conditional
release of any of its source code). 



(i) None of the Proprietary Products contains any software code that is, in
whole or in part, subject to the provisions of any license to software that is
made generally available to the public without requiring the payment of any
fees or royalties (including but not limited to the GNU General Public
License ("GPL"), GNU Lesser General Public License ("LGPL"), Mozilla Public
License ("MPL", BSD licenses, and any other similar "free software" or "open
source" licenses), including but not limited to any such license under which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to make the source code
for such Proprietary Product generally available to the public free of charge.



(j) The Company does not have any obligation to pay any third party any
royalties or other fees (in the aggregate in excess of $250,000 in 2002 or for
the period from January 1, 2003 through and including June 30, 2003) for the

license, sublicense or other agreement or instrument related to the Company
Intellectual Property to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or is otherwise bound; (ii) the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in any loss or impairment
of ownership by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of, or the right of
any of them to use (or result in any term extension or expansion of the rights
granted to any third party in or to), any Company Intellectual Property that
is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted; (iii) the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not require the consent of any third party or, to the
Companys knowledge, any Governmental Entity, with respect to any such
Intellectual Property.

trademarks, service marks, trade names, and internet domain names, together
with all goodwill, registrations and applications related to the
foregoing; patentable inventions, patents and industrial design registrations
or applications (including any continuations, divisionals, continuations-in-
part, renewals, reissues, re-examinations and applications for any of the

policies and other forms of insurance maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, provide adequate coverage for all normal risks incident to the

liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31, 2002 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, and (b) liabilities that,
individually and in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be

information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Registration Statement
shall not at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to
the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting, shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any

the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement which, at
such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or shall omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct
any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting which has become false or

relating to Parent or any of its respective affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by Parent which should be set forth in an amendment to
the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Parent shall promptly inform the Company. The Registration Statement shall
comply in all material respects as to form and substance with the requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company which is
contained in any of the foregoing documents.



SECTION 4.10 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other
than Goldman Sachs and Co. whose brokerage, finders or other fee will be paid
by Parent) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.



SECTION 4.11 _No Parent Stockholder Vote Required_. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the issuance of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Article II hereof, does not require the
approval of the holders of any shares of capital stock of Parent.

ARTICLE VI



ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



SECTION 6.1. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to) afford to Parent and to Parents
officers, employees, financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants,
consultants and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to all of its books
and records (other than privileged documents) and its properties, plants and
personnel and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to
Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by
it pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws, provided that no
investigation by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall affect any
representations, warranties covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, each party agrees that it (and
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives) shall hold in
confidence all non-public information acquired from the other party or
the other partys representatives in accordance with the terms of the Non-
Disclosure Agreement effective January 15, 2003 between Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").



SECTION 6.2 _No Solicitation_.



(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and affiliates shall not,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
representative or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and it
shall use reasonable efforts to cause such officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly), (i) solicit,
initiate, resume, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or proposals that
constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) engage  



 

38  in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public
information to any person or entity relating to, any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the "Applicable Period"), the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside
counsel, that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, the Company may, in
response to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.2(b)) which was not
solicited by it and which did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.2(a), and subject to providing prior written notice of its decision
to take such action to Parent (a "Section 6.2 Notice") and compliance with
Section 6.2(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any person making a Superior Proposal pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the Company
(including with respect to standstill or other provisions) than
the Confidentiality Agreement and permitting the disclosure contemplated by
this Section 6.2 and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
such Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more
of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 25% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person beneficially
owning 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall:



(i) except as set forth in this Section 6.2, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the approval or recommendation by the Companys Board of Directors or any
such committee of this Agreement or the Merger;



(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to
any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 6.2(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in and
consistent with the provisions of Section 6.2(a)); or



(iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in
response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by the
Company of this Section 6.2, withdraw or modify the recommendation by the
Companys Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this Agreement and
the Merger, if the Companys Board of Directors  



 

39  determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel,
that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, but only at a
time that is prior to the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and is after the third (3rd business day following
Parents receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Companys Board of
Directors desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation due to the
existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior
Proposal. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to (A) permit the
Company to take any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first
sentence of this Section 6.2(b) other than in connection with a termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), or (B) affect any other
obligation of the Company under this Agreement or (C) limit the Companys
obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting, regardless of whether the Companys Board of Directors has withdrawn
or modified its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger.



If Parent makes a counterproposal to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf
in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal. For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, written
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment (after receiving advice of an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all of the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) to be more favorable
to the Companys stockholders than the Merger, to have a reasonable likelihood
of closing, and for which financing, to the extent required, is then
committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company, is reasonably capable of being, and likely to be, obtained on the
proposed terms by such third party.



(c) The Company agrees that as of the date of this Agreement, it shall and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and affiliates (and their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents) to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any person (other than Parent or its representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt
by the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request
for nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person or entity that informs the Company that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, inquiry or contact. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
current basis  



 

40  (and in any event within 24 hours) of all developments and the status of any
Acquisition Proposal, any negotiations or discussions with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or
entity that is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall provide Parent with copies of all documents received from or
delivered or sent to any person or entity that is considering making or has
made an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other person in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to
Parent.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
taking any action or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as specifically
permitted in this Section 6.2 or in connection with the termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h), neither the Company nor
its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this
Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.



SECTION 6.3 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement._



(a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall in consultation with each other prepare, and the Company
shall file with the SEC, preliminary proxy materials which shall constitute
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. As promptly as practicable after comments are
received from the SEC thereon and after the furnishing by the Company and
Parent of all information required to be contained therein, (i) the Company
shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii) Parent shall
file with the SEC the Registration Statement. The Company and Parent shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as soon thereafter as practicable.



(b) The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company as soon as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC.
Subject to the right of the Companys Board of Directors to withdraw or modify
its recommendation pursuant to Section 6.2(b), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in
favor of the Merger.



(c) The Company shall furnish Parent with all information concerning the
Company and the holders of its capital stock and shall take such other action
as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Registration Statement
and the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any event  



 

41  or circumstance relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by such
party which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, such party shall
promptly inform the other thereof and take appropriate action in respect
thereof.



(d) The Company and Parent shall make any necessary filing with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.



SECTION 6.4 _Company Stockholders Meeting._



(a) The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall take all actions
in accordance with applicable law, the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws
and the rules of The Nasdaq National Market to promptly and duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within forty-five (45) days after the declaration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
considering and voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger.
Subject to Section 6.2(b), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, (i) the Companys Board of Directors shall recommend adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of the Company
and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii)
neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors that
the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger. Unless such recommendation shall have been modified
or withdrawn in accordance with Section 6.2(b), the Company shall take all
action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company that are required by the
rules of The Nasdaq National Market or the GCL. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with
Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as
of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

 



(b) The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4 and shall submit the
proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger to its
stockholders for the purpose of acting upon such proposal whether or not (i)
the Companys Board of Directors at any time subsequent to the date of this
Agreement determines, in the manner permitted by Section 6.2(b), that the
proposal is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the
Company reject such proposal, or (ii) any actual, potential or purported  



 

42  Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has been commenced, disclosed,
announced or submitted to the Company. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited by the Company in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance
with the GCL, the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws, the rules of The
Nasdaq National Market and all other applicable legal requirements.



(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate of its Corporate Secretary setting forth the voting results from
the Company Stockholders Meeting.



SECTION 6.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and, subject to
Section 6.2, the Company will use all reasonable best efforts to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed with respect to the
Merger (which efforts shall include, without limitation, furnishing all
information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or
filings with any other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with
and furnish information to each other in connection with any such requirements
imposed upon any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with
each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by
Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to sell or
dispose of or hold separately (through a trust or otherwise) any material
assets or businesses of Parent, its Affiliates or the Company, or make any
other material change in any portion of its business or incur any other
material limitation on Parents conduct of its business to obtain such
authorizations, approvals, consents and waivers.



SECTION 6.6 _Affiliate Legends_. Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of those persons who are, in the Companys
reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 145 Affiliates"). The Company
shall notify Parent in writing regarding any change in the identity of its
Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall be entitled to
place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received by Rule 145 Affiliates of the Company in
the Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in Rule 145 promulgated
under the Securities Act and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions
to the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock (provided that such legends or
stop transfer instructions shall be removed, one year after the Effective
Time, upon the request of any holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in the Merger if such holder is not then a Rule 145 Affiliate of Parent).



SECTION 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may upon the written advice of  



 

43  counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or The
Nasdaq National Market if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party prior thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the parties hereto (and
each employee, representative, or other agent of such parties) may disclose to
any person, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the Transactions and all materials (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such tax treatment
and tax structure.



SECTION 6.8 _Listing of Parent Shares_. Parent shall use its reasonable
efforts to have authorized for listing on the NYSE, upon official notice of
issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.



SECTION 6.9 _Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan_.



(a) To the maximum extent permitted under Parents employee benefit plans,
the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary who continue in employment with
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the
Effective Time (the "Company Employees") shall be eligible to participate,
upon the same terms and conditions, in the various employee benefit plans
which Parent or its affiliates maintain for their respective employees. In
furtherance thereof, from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection
with all employee benefit plans of Parent or its affiliates in which Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes
of benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension
plan). From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations
and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting
periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company)
under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with
respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each
Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses
incurred prior to the Effective Time for which evidence of payment is provided
to Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary,
Parent and its Subsidiaries agree to honor in accordance with their terms and
not contest any and all benefits accrued or vested as of the Effective Time,
or otherwise contingent in whole or in part upon the occurrence of one or
more transactions contemplated by this Agreement, under any employee benefit
plan or agreement of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed in Section 3.24
of the Disclosure Schedule, including, without limitation, any rights or
benefits arising under any such plan or agreement as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with any other event, including termination of employment or service); it
being understood that for purposes of any such plan or agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute, or will be deemed to
constitute, both a "change of control" and a "corporate transaction".



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent  



 

44  may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect
as of the Effective Time such actions relating to the Legato Systems, Inc.
401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate,
including without limitation, terminating the 401(k) Plan, subject to the
terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable law and provided that such action does
not preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any
successor plan.



(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event within thirty (30) days thereof, Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the outstanding Company Stock Options assumed under
Section 6.10(a) for which a Form S-8 registration statement is available. The
Company shall cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of
such registration statement. Parent shall use its best efforts to maintain
such Form S-8 registration statement in effect until all the Company Stock
Options are either exercised or expire.



SECTION 6.10 _Stock Plans_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, and the Company Stock Plans (other than the ESPP) themselves,
shall be assumed by Parent and shall be deemed to constitute an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and
exercisability) as were applicable under the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the same number of shares of Parent Common Stock
as the holder of the Company Stock Option would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole
number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the quotient of (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Option
in accordance with the foregoing. Such Company Stock Options shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required
by this Section after giving effect to the Merger). It is the intention of
the parties that the options so assumed by Parent hereunder qualify, to the
maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time as "incentive stock
options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. As promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event within
thirty (30) days thereof, Parent shall make available to each person who
immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of a Company Stock
Option assumed hereunder information evidencing the assumption of such option
by Parent.



(b) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of any Company
Stock Plan or any Company Stock Option, the Company shall, prior to the
Effective Time, (i) obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options
and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to
give effect to the provisions of Section 6.10(a).



 

45 SECTION 6.11 _Consents_. The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts
to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of the
Companys material agreements, contracts, licenses or leases in connection
with the Merger, including without limitation each of the consents listed in
Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule or required to prevent the occurrence
of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect prior to the Effective Time
or after the Effective Time. 



SECTION 6.12 _Indemnification and Insurance._



(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of litigation expenses and
limitation of personal liability existing in favor of the directors, officers
and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the provisions
existing on the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter or Company By-
Laws shall, with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), survive the Effective Time, and, as of the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all obligations of the Company in
respect thereof as to any claim or claims asserted prior to or within a six-
year period immediately after the Effective Time.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to former officers and directors
of the Company) only with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.12(b) more than an aggregate amount equal to one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance (the "Maximum Amount") (which premiums the Company represents
and warrants to be approximately $1,125,000 in the aggregate). If the amount
of the aggregate annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation
during such six-year period shall maintain or procure as much coverage as
possible for aggregate annual premiums not to exceed the Maximum Amount. 



SECTION 6.13 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



SECTION 6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure
to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a)(i) any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as  



 

46  to materiality to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any
material failure of Parent and the Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may
be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change
or event having, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, on such party or the ability for the conditions set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.14 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions
to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.



SECTION 6.15 _Takeover Statutes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, in no event shall the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company under Section 203 of the
GCL be withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board of Directors of the
Company. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and
the Companys Board of Directors shall promptly grant such approvals and take
such lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such lawful
actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any
regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions.



SECTION 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_.



(a) The Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective
Time providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock
in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock, and of options to
purchase Parent Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of Company Stock
Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to
the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, is
intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. In
addition, the Board of Directors of the Company, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the disposition by the Company Insiders of
Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Parent Common Stock, and the
disposition of their Company Stock Options which will be deemed to occur upon
the assumption of those options and their resulting conversion into options to
purchase Parent Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the
Section 16 Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.



 

47 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 16 Information" means
information regarding the Company Insiders and (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or other Company equity securities deemed to be
beneficially owned by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged
for Parent Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock, together with the applicable exercise price per share, subject to each
Company Stock Option held by the Company Insider which is to be assumed and
converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, in each case, in
connection with the Merger, which shall be provided by the Company to Parent
within 10 business days after the date of this Agreement.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Insiders" means those officers
and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as listed in the Section 16 Information.



SECTION 6.17. _Treatment as Reorganization_. None of the parties hereto
shall take any action that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



SECTION 6.18. _Representation on Parent Board_. Parent shall take such
action as may be necessary to cause the number of Directors comprising the
Parents Board of Directors at the Effective Time to be sufficient to permit
one director of the Company, who shall be mutually agreed by Parent and the
Company, to serve thereon. Parent shall, as of the Effective Time, appoint
such director to serve on the Parents Board for a term ending at the 2004
Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Parent.

shall survive termination and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement as provided therein.



SECTION 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated; provided, however _,_ that Parent and the Company shall share
equally all fees and expenses (but not including attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with the printing and filing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials related thereto),
the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) and
any amendments or supplements thereto and filings by Parent and the Company
under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any similar filing requirement
of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Merger or this Agreement.



(b) The Company shall reimburse Parent for all fees and expenses of
Parent actually incurred relating to the transactions contemplated by this

this Agreement (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or
8.1(h), (ii) by Parent pursuant to Sections 8.1(e) or 8.1(g), or (iii) by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), 7.2(a), or 7.2(b) by the Outside Date
shall have resulted in the Closing not occurring.



(c) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $45,000,000.00 upon the
earliest to occur of the following events (each, a "Termination Event"):



(i) the entry by the Company into an agreement with respect to, or the
consummation of, any Acquisition Proposal or the acquisition by any person of
beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the equity or voting interests of the
Company in any such case within 270 days of the termination of this
Agreement  



 

53  pursuant to Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(d) or 8.1(e) if prior to such termination
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal; or



(ii) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(g)
(other than pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(v)(B)) or by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(h).



(d) The expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b) shall be paid promptly
upon termination of this Agreement, but in no event later than two (2)
business days after the date of the first to occur of the events described in
Sections 8.3(b)(i), (ii) or (iii). The fees payable pursuant to Section
8.3(c) shall be paid promptly upon termination of this Agreement, but in no
event later than two (2) business days after the date of the first to occur of
the events described in Sections 8.3(c)(i) or (ii); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of fees payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(i), 25% of such
fees shall be paid promptly upon termination of this Agreement, but in no
event later than two (2) business days after the date of the first to occur
of the events described in Sections 8.3(c)(i), and the remaining 75% of such
fees shall be paid prior to the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal or
other acquisition referred to therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the fees and expenses of Parent
if, immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement, Parent was in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.3(c) are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(c),
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in
a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in Section 8.3(c), the
Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses) actually incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
