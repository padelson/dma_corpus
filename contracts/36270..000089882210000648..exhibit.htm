and Company Preferred Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of such Certificates)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (the
" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter
of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive
promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock and a holder of Company Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration
in respect of the shares of Company Preferred Stock represented by its
Certificate or Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall represent after the Effective
Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the
Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with, and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Article II.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common

abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the

Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate or Book
Entry Shares and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of

or Book Entry Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before

Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, issuable with
respect to such Certificate or Book Entry Shares.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book Entry
Shares representing Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is
not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, comprising the Merger
Consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate or Book Entry Shares formerly representing such
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the issuance to a person other than the registered holder   

 

 

6

 

     

 

 



 

of the Certificate or Book Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each of the Exchange
Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or
Parent Preferred Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock such amounts as the
Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and timely paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
as the case may be.

 



 

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as the case may be, that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book Entry
Shares representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange
Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration to
be issued or paid in consideration therefore in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Article II.

 

(f) The Exchange Agent shall aggregate all fractional interests in Parent
Common Stock and sell all such shares, in one or more transactions executed on
one or more stock exchanges through one or more brokers nominated by Parent
with the proceeds of such sale being remitted to the Exchange Agent as soon as
practicable thereafter. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the cash proceeds of
any such sales to the holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of their
fractional interest in shares of Parent Common Stock. The proceeds to any
holder of Company Common Stock of shares of Parent Common Stock sold by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(f) shall be the proceeds before
any costs associated with any such sale, and any costs incurred in connection
with any such sale (including any commissions, currency exchange fees,
transfer taxes and other transaction costs) shall be borne by Parent.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
may be paid to Parent. In such event, any former stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
or Parent Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost,   

 

 

7

 

     

 

 



 

stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all such third parties or Governmental Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no party shall be required to take any action pursuant to the foregoing
sentence if the taking of such action or the obtaining of or compliance with

Agreement.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or

permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required

hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

the level of benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements that
such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date for
  

 

 

39

 

     

 

 



 

 

 such Covered EmployeeÂ’s service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to the same extent recognized by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that the foregoing

maintained for the Covered Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and

less favorable than those provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

following the Closing Date, the severance benefits provided to Covered
Employees who experience a termination of employment in a manner entitling
such employees to severance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan as in

those provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, which
shall be consistent with the severance chart previously provided by Company to
Parent.

 

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under all
employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other compensation
contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with
their terms. Parent hereby acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a
"Change in Control" (or concept of similar import) in accordance with the
provisions of the Company Benefit Plans. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, after consummation of the Merger to, pay all amounts
provided under such Company Benefit Plans and agreements as a result of a

6.5 _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and
Insurance_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.5(c), each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matter in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under benefit plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), as provided in the
Company Certificate or Company Bylaws or indemnification agreement listed in
Section 6.5(a) of the Disclosure Letter and as in effect as of the date
hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms; _provided_ , however, that nothing herein
shall be construed to limit ParentÂ’s ability following the Closing to
undertake any type of internal reorganization as it may deem desirable,
including without limitation liquidating, merging or otherwise taking action
with respect to any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party, and any person who becomes an Indemnified
Party between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any
such party as a director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another
corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other
entity or (ii) any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, _provided_ that
if required by applicable law, the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.5(b), upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall notify Parent thereof. Any failure to so notify shall
not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.5(b) unless and to the
extent that Parent is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) maintain in effect (A) the
current provisions regarding indemnification of and the advancement of
expenses to Indemnified Parties contained in the Company Certificate and
Company Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (B) any indemnification   

 

 

41

 

     

 

 



 

 

 agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with or for the benefit of
any Indemnified Parties existing on the date hereof, and (ii) jointly and
severally indemnify the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law. For purposes of the foregoing: (i) in the event any claim is
asserted within the six (6)-year period during which Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are required to maintain the indemnification arrangements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (A) all such rights in respect of any such claim
shall continue until disposition thereof and (B) the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to advancement of expenses within five (5) Business Days following
receipt of any such claim involving such Indemnified Party; and (ii) any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
PartyÂ’s conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL, the
Company Certificate or Company Bylaws (or the organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation) or any such agreement, as the case may be, for purposes
of the allowance of indemnification or advancement of expenses, shall be made
by independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Party and reasonably
acceptable to Parent. The fees and expenses of such independent legal counsel
shall be paid for by the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be required to
pay such expenses contemplated by this Section 6.5(c) and shall be entitled to
repayment of any advance payments of such expenses from an Indemnified Party
if it is finally adjudicated or determined following the expiration of any
period for appeal that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnity
under this Section 6.5.

 

(d) Parent shall provide for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time, directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries covering, without limitation, claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated hereby, which insurance shall contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event
shall Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance (which such amount is set forth on Schedule 6.5(d) of the Disclosure
Letter, the " _Insurance Amount_ ")) and _provided_ , _further_ , that if
Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or substitute policy) as a result of
the preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time. In lieu
of the foregoing, Parent, or the Company in consultation with Parent for an
aggregate price of no more than 325% of the Insurance Amount, may obtain, on
or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence. From and
after the Effective Time, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the
Company shall take any action that would materially prejudice the rights of,
or otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of any insurance policy
contemplated by this Section 6.5(d), whether in respect of claims arising
before or after the Effective Time.

 

(e) Without limiting in any way the rights of any party to assert any
condition or terminate this Agreement or take any other action in accordance
with Article VII or VIII of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or
modified by such parties in a manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Person, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.5, to
  

 

 

42

 

     

 

 



 

 

 whom this Section 6.5 applies without the consent of the affected
Indemnified Person or such other person, as the case may be. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.5 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each other
person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.5, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise.

 

6.6 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Parent and the
Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain certain
directors and officers of the Company in connection with the Merger, both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the directors and
officers of the Company not be subject to a risk of liability under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes
agree to the provisions of this Section 6.6. The Company Board, or a
committee of "Non-Employee Directors" (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution
providing that the disposition by the directors and officers of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Awards, in each case pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act.

 

6.7 _Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger to have been authorized for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.8 _Wealth Advisory Services and Corporate Client Services to be Held
Separate_. The parties intend that, from and after the Effective Time, the
Wealth Advisory Services and Corporate Client Services businesses of the
Company shall be held out to ParentÂ’s clients and potential clients as a
distinct line of business of Parent and division within ParentÂ’s corporate
structure and will continue to contain the substantial core of the CompanyÂ’s
Wealth Advisory Services and Corporate Client Services businesses. Parent
recognizes that the integrity and reputation of the trademarks and brand names
related to the CompanyÂ’s Wealth Advisory Services and Corporate Client
Services businesses, including the "Wilmington Trust" name and branding, are
an essential asset Parent is acquiring in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and ParentÂ’s current intention is to continue to employ and
preserve such trademarks and brand names in a manner consistent with the way
they have been used in the past. Parent intends that Wilmington, Delaware
will serve as the headquarters for the Wealth Advisory Services and Corporate
Client Services businesses following the Effective Time. Parent currently
intends to seek opportunities to use the Wealth Advisory Services and
Corporate Client Services business as a platform for expanding or enhancing
ParentÂ’s existing wealth advisory services and corporate client services
businesses.

 

 

43

 

     

 

 



 

 

6.9 _[Reserved]_.

 

6.10 _Commitments to the Community_. It is the current intention of
Parent that the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the CompanyÂ’s strong
commitment to charitable giving in the greater Wilmington, Delaware area and
to maintain or increase the annual level of charitable giving beyond the
current levels of the Company in that area. Parent agrees to honor and to
cause the Company to honor the CompanyÂ’s obligations to pay in a timely
fashion all currently outstanding charitable pledges and sponsorships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are set forth in Section 6.10 of the
Disclosure Letter to the extent they remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 

6.11 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that, following the date of this Agreement and
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Article VIII hereof, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and each of its SubsidiariesÂ’ officers, directors, employees, advisors,
agents and representatives, including any investment banker, attorney, advisor
or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Representatives_
") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
(including by providing information or assistance) or facilitate any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion
of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Alternative Transaction Proposal (as defined in Section 6.11(f)(ii)), (ii)
provide or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to or in connection with an actual or
proposed Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to disclose the existence of
the provisions of this Section 6.11), (iii) engage in any discussions or
negotiations concerning an Alternative Transaction Proposal (provided that the
Company may refer any such person or entity to the provisions of this Section
6.11), or otherwise take any action to knowingly encourage or facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Transaction Proposal,
including exempting any person (other than Parent and Merger Sub and their
Affiliates) from the Company Rights Agreement (iv) approve, recommend, agree
to or accept, or propose publicly to approve, recommend, agree to or accept,
any Alternative Transaction Proposal, or (v) approve, endorse or recommend,
agree to or accept, or propose to approve, endorse, recommend, agree to or
accept, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Alternative Transaction Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 6.11(a) by any Subsidiary or Representative of the
Company shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.11(a) by the Company. The
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct
each of its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal (except with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any person (other than the parties hereto)
that has made or indicated an intention to make an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, and (iii) not waive or amend any "standstill" provision or
provisions of similar effect to which it is a part or of which it is a
beneficiary, except (A) to the extent   

 

 

44

 

     

 

 



 

 

 necessary to permit the Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted
to take under Section 6.11(b)(ii) or (B) to the extent that the Company has
duly effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance with the terms hereof
with respect to a proposal by the third party subject to such standstill
provision.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
6.11(a), in the event that, prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, the
Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of
Section 6.11(a) and that is determined (in accordance with Section
6.11(f)(iii)) to be, or, in the good faith determination of the Company Board,
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal (as
defined in Section 6.11(f)(iii)), it may, prior to (but not after) the receipt
of Stockholder Approval, take the following actions (but only if and to the
extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would cause it to violate
its fiduciary duties under applicable law):

 

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the person or group of persons making
such bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal, _provided_ that prior
to furnishing any such nonpublic information, the Company receives from such
person or group of persons an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms at least as restrictive with respect to such person or group of persons
as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement is with respect to
Parent and _provided_ , _further_ _,_ that the Company shall simultaneously
provide or make available to Parent any nonpublic information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such
bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which was not previously
provided or made available to Parent; and

 

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or group of
persons with respect to such bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) after receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information or any inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, the Company shall
provide Parent with notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, including in each case
the identity of the person making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal or
inquiry and the material terms of such Alternative Transaction Proposal or
inquiry. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent as promptly as
possible with notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably
necessary to keep Parent informed in all material respects of all
communications regarding (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments), such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board may, if it concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the
failure to do so would cause it to violate its   

 

 

45

 

     

 

 



 

 

 fiduciary duties under applicable law, withdraw, modify or change the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that prior to any such Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall have complied in all material respects with
Section 6.11(a), given Parent and Merger Sub prompt written notice advising
them of the decision of the Company Board to take such action and, in the
event the decision relates to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, given
Parent the material terms and conditions of the Alternative Transaction
Proposal, including the identity of the person making any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of such Alternative
Transaction Proposal or inquiry; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
event the decision relates to an Alternative Transaction Proposal: (i) the
Company shall have given Parent and Merger Sub three (3) Business Days after
delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
(or make another proposal) and if Parent and Merger Sub propose to revise the
terms of this Agreement, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith with
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposal; and (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Parent and Merger
Sub, if any, that such Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. In the event the Company Board does not make the determination
referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph and thereafter determines to
withdraw, modify or change the Company Board Recommendation pursuant to this
Section 6.11(d), the procedures referred to above shall apply anew and shall
also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change. In the event of
any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.11(d) with respect to such new written notice,
except that the three (3) Business Day period referred to above shall be
reduced to two (2) Business Days. Notwithstanding any Change of
Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company at the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval
of this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the
Company of such obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the board of
directors of the Company shall have effected a Change of Recommendation, then
the board of directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded), in which
event the board of directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its
lack of a recommendation to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by applicable Law. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholder any Acquisition Transaction
Proposal other than the Merger.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its stockholders any
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if
the Company Board (after consultation with its legal advisors) concludes that
its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

 

 

46

 

     

 

 



 

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 

(i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " with respect to the Company, shall mean
any of the following transactions: (i) any transaction or series of related
transactions with one or more third persons involving: (A) any purchase from
such party or acquisition (whether by way of a merger, share exchange,

any person or "group" of persons (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of such party or any of
its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person or group of persons beneficially owning 15% or more
of the total outstanding voting securities of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any sale,
lease exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of more than 15%
of the assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii)
any liquidation or dissolution of such party;

 

(ii) " _Alternative Transaction Proposal_ " shall mean any offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest (whether binding or non-binding) to the

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written
Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third person (or group of persons

merger, consolidation or other business combination or acquisition
transaction, (A) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or (B)

the Company Board has in good faith determined (taking into account, among
other things, (1) its consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors and (2) the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Transaction Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended
by Parent)), to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and to be reasonably capable
of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all other
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal and the person making the proposal.

(e) by Parent, if:

 

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) of this Agreement and (B)
is incapable of being cured (or is not cured) by the Company within thirty
(30) calendar days   

 

 

50

 

     

 

 



 

 

 following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
from Parent, _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any such condition
to be capable of satisfaction is not the result of a material breach of this
Agreement by Parent;

 

(ii) at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (A)
withdraws, modifies or qualifies in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
or publicly proposes to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or effects a Change of
Recommendation or (B) publicly approves, endorses or recommends or publicly
proposes to approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Transaction
Proposal; or

 

(iii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a
Subsidiary thereof), and the board of directors of the Company recommends that
the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such stockholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) Business Day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.3, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected. Termination
of this Agreement by the Company shall not require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the
Company, Parent, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers
or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that (i) Sections 6.3(b), 8.2, 8.3, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6,
9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) neither the Company nor Parent shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its knowing breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except with respect to costs and expenses of printing and mailing the
Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection
with the Merger, which shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent, and
all filing and other fees in connection with any filing under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which shall be borne by Parent, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3(b) hereof.

 

 

51

 

     

 

 



 

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (x) prior to the Effective Time and after the date hereof, any person
shall have made an Alternative Transaction Proposal, which proposal has been
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn, or any person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by any party
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) without the Stockholder Approval having been
obtained or Section 8.1(c)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) and
(z) within nine (9) months after the termination of this Agreement, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal shall have been consummated or any definitive
agreement with respect to an Alternative Transaction Proposal shall have been
entered into. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Alternative
Transaction Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
6.11(f)(ii) of this Agreement except that the references to "15%" in the
definition of "Alternative Transaction" in Section 6.11(f)(i) of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be references to "50%". In no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion; or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) (if
such termination is based on the CompanyÂ’s breach of or failure to perform its
obligations under Sections 6.1(b) or 6.11), 8.1(e)(ii) or 8.1(e)(iii);

 

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.3(b), the
Company shall pay Parent a fee, in immediately available funds, in the amount
of $30 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") immediately following the earlier
of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the
consummation of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, in the case of a
termination described in clause (i) above, and immediately upon delivery of
the written notice of termination required by Section 8.1, in the event of a
termination described in clause (ii) above.

 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into
this Agreement. The amounts payable by the Company and Parent pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) and (b) hereof constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty
and shall be the sole monetary remedy of such party in the event of
termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such section. In the
event that either party fails to pay when due any amounts payable under this
Section 8.3, then (1) such party shall reimburse the other party for all costs
and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred
in connection with the collection of such overdue amount, and (2) such party
shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount (for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to
be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in
full) at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in The Wall Street
Journal on the date such payment was required to be made.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with
Merger by the stockholders of the Company; ___provided_ , ___however_ , that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, there may not be, without further approval of
such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further
approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

9.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Disclosure Letter sections, such reference
shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Disclosure Letter section
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " shall mean
any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking
organizations in Wilmington, Delaware or New York, New York are required or
authorized by Law to be closed. All Disclosure Letter sections and exhibits
hereto shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to
this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in
this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms,   

 

 

54

 

     

 

 



 

 

 provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines
that any provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable,
it is the express intention of the parties that such provision, covenant or
restriction be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

 

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same
counterpart.

 

9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed entirely within such state, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto agree that any
suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties
hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from
present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each
party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

 

9.8 _Publicity_. The Company and Parent each shall consult with the
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and prior to making any filings with any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect thereto, except as may be required
by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of
any national securities exchange or national market system on which such
partyÂ’s securities are listed or traded, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall consult with the other to the extent
practicable. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

9.9 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the   

 

 

55

 

     

 

 



 

 

 other party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null
and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Except for: (a) the right of the
Indemnified Parties to enforce the provisions of Section 6.5 (Indemnification;
Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and Insurance) only, and (b) the right of
the Company on behalf of its stockholders to pursue damages (including claims
for damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders) in the event of ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s breach of
this Agreement (whether or not the Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Article VIII), which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub, (1) Parent and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and (2) this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The third-party beneficiary
rights referenced in clause (b) of the preceding sentence may be exercised
only by the Company (on behalf of its stockholders as their agent) through
actions expressly approved by the Company Board, and no stockholders of the
Company whether purporting to act in its capacity as a stockholder or
purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the
Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise of
any such right. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
provisions of each of Section 6.4 and Section 6.8 are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any
other individual or entity shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored
by Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates; (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan; (iii)
confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant,
any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or constitute
or create an employment agreement with any individual; or (iv) alter or limit
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
to make necessary or appropriate changes to their respective businesses in
response to changed circumstances, unforeseen events or the like.

 

9.10 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges that money
damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach
of this Agreement by such party and that any such breach would cause Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
irreparable harm. Accordingly, each party hereto also agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement
by such party, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, including in the form of injunctions and
orders for specific performance, in addition to all other remedies available
to such other parties at Law or in equity.

 

9.11 _Disclosure Letter_. Before entry into this Agreement, the Company
delivered to Parent a letter (the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") that sets forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure   

 

 

56

 

     

 

 



 

 

 requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or
more representation or warranties contained in Article III, or to one or more
covenants contained herein; _provided_ , __ _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be
set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ "
means information set forth by the Company in the applicable paragraph of the
Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that disclosure in any paragraph of the
CompanyÂ’s Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the indicated section of this
Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of
such disclosure that it is relevant to such other paragraph of the Disclosure
Letter.

 

 

57

 

     

 

 



 

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized as of the date first above written.
