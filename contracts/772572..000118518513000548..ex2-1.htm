This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement"), is entered into as of
March 17, 2013, by and among EDAC Technologies Corporation, a Wisconsin
corporation (the "Company"), GB Aero Engine LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Parent"), and GB Aero Engine Merger Sub Inc., a Wisconsin

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent and in
accordance with the terms hereof, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act")) a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all
of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.0025
per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") (such issued and
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, collectively, the "Shares"),
other than Shares directly owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company and any Shares held in the treasury of the Company, at the Offer
Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with Section 180.1103 or Section 180.1104 of
the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"), with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger"), whereby
each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 3.01(a)) that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to
the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and conditions set
forth herein;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the Company's
shareholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub in the Offer
and, to the extent applicable, adopt this Agreement and thereby approve the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that the

Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective members or stockholders, as applicable, and (ii) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger;

  

  

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Company\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a duly executed limited
guarantee of Greenbriar Equity Fund II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership,
Greenbriar Equity Fund II-A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and
Greenbriar Co-Investment Partners II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership

Annex I to this Agreement (the "Limited Guarantee"), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Guarantors have guaranteed
certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder;

  

  

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are entering into a support
agreement with Parent in the form attached as Annex II to this Agreement (the
"Support Agreements"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, such shareholders are agreeing to (i) tender the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them in the Offer, and (ii) support
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, each on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

The Offer

  

  

Section 1.01 The Offer.

  

  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII hereof, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof
(but in no event later than the seventh (7th) Business Day after the date
hereof), Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d−2 under the
Exchange Act), and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence, the Offer to
purchase all of the issued and outstanding Shares at a price per Share in cash
equal to $17.75 (such amount to be paid for each Share, as it may be amended
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof, the "Offer Price") net
to the seller, without interest and less any taxes required to be withheld as
described in Section 3.04. The Company agrees that no Shares owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to
accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Expiration Date (the
"Tendered Shares") shall be subject only to (i) the satisfaction of the
minimum condition set forth in clause (i) of Annex III hereto (such condition,
the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or
Merger Sub of the other conditions set forth in Annex III hereto (such
conditions, together with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions") and
the terms and conditions hereof. The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit
of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, other
than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only
with the prior written consent of the Company, in each case on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to
increase the Offer Price or to waive or to modify the terms or conditions of
the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall make any change to the terms or conditions
of the Offer that (i) reduces the Offer Price, (ii) changes the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduces the number of Shares sought
to be purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer, (iv) waive or amend the Minimum
Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or impose any other conditions to
the Offer, (vi) extend the expiration of the Offer except as required or
permitted in Section 1.01 of this Agreement, or (vii) otherwise amend, modify
or supplement any Offer Condition or any term of the Offer set forth in this
Agreement, in each case in a manner adverse to the holders of the Shares.
Parent and Merger Sub shall not abandon or terminate the Offer prior to any
expiration date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the
event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Article VIII.

  

  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the
initial expiration date for the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time,
on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days from and after the date the
Offer is commenced, as determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the
Exchange Act (such initial expiration date as it may be extended in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
or the Nasdaq that is applicable to the Offer. Merger Sub may without the
consent of the Company (in each case unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Article VIII), (i) extend the Offer for one or more consecutive
increments of not more than ten (10) Business Days each, if at the then-
scheduled Expiration Date any Offer Condition has not been satisfied or waived
(the length of such period to be determined by Parent and Merger Sub) and/or
(ii) make available a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act. If at any then-scheduled Expiration Date any
Offer Condition has not been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause it to (in each case unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Article VIII), extend the Offer on one or more occasions at the
request of the Company for successive periods of not more than twenty (20)
Business Days (the length of such period to be determined by Parent and Merger
Sub) until the earlier to occur of (A) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and (B) September 30, 2013. Nothing in this Section
1.01(c) shall (i) impose any obligation on Merger Sub to extend the Offer
beyond September 30, 2013, or (ii) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions
set forth in Annex III hereto. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, on the terms set forth in this Agreement and subject only to the prior
satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions (provided, however, that the
Minimum Condition may not be waived without the written consent of the
Company), accept for payment and pay for all Tendered Shares as soon as
practicable after the Expiration Date. If Merger Sub makes available a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Section 1.01(c) hereof, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for
all Shares that are validly tendered during such "subsequent offering period"
promptly (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) after any
Shares are validly tendered during such "subsequent offering period."

  

  

(e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain the Offer to Purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the
"Offer Documents"), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company as and to the extent required by United States
federal securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder (the "Federal Securities Laws"). Parent and Merger Sub shall cause
the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the Federal
Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver copies of the proposed
forms of the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto)
to the Company within a reasonable time prior to the dissemination or filing
thereof for review and comment by the Company and its counsel, and shall
consider in good faith any comments of the Company. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer or the Offer Documents and promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by the Federal Securities Laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall amend or supplement the Offer Documents and cause the Offer
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Federal Securities Laws and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company
and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity
under the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or oral
responses to such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation as it may be amended
or modified, and until but not after it is withdrawn, in each case as
permitted by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub all of the funds necessary
to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of
Merger Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement with respect to consummation of
the Offer and the Merger and payment or issuance of consideration contemplated
by this Agreement in respect thereof.

  

  

Section 1.02 Company Actions.

  

  

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, with respect to
the Offer, the Company shall file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments and supplements thereto and
including the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which, subject to
Section 6.04, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation. Parent shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the shareholders of the Company
along with the Offer Documents in accordance with Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act and Federal Securities Laws. The Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Federal Securities Laws. The
Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) to Parent within a
reasonable time prior to the dissemination or filing thereof for review and
comment by Parent and its counsel, and shall consider in good faith any
comments of Parent. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 and promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by the
Federal Securities Laws. The Company shall amend or supplement the Schedule
14D-9 and cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Federal Securities Laws. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the
receipt of such comments and shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity under
the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or oral
responses to such comments.

  

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, if requested by Merger Sub, the Company
shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Common
Stock, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and security position listings
of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date,
and shall promptly furnish to Merger Sub such additional information,
including updated lists of shareholders of the Company, mailing labels,
security position listings and computer files, and such other information and
assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request for the purpose
of communicating the Offer to the shareholders of the Company. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub and their
agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, will use such information only in connection with such
transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request,
deliver, and will cause their agents to deliver, to the Company, or destroy or
cause their agents to destroy, all copies of such information then in their
possession or control.

Section 1.03 Directors.

  

  

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly after the initial
acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of the Tendered Shares pursuant to the
Offer (the "Acceptance Time") and from time to time thereafter (but only for
so long as Parent and Merger Sub beneficially own at least a majority of the
outstanding Shares), Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board
as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company
Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to
the next sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub at such time (including
Shares so accepted for payment and, if the Top-Up Option is exercised, the
Shares purchased upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option) represents as a
fraction of the total number of Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis. In furtherance thereof, promptly after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Parent\'s designees to be so elected or appointed, including increasing the
size of the Company Board and/or seeking the resignations of one or more
incumbent directors as appropriate. The Company shall, subject to any
limitations imposed by applicable Law and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq
and Section 1.03(c), also cause (a) each committee of the Company Board, (b)
the board of directors of each of its Subsidiaries and (c) each committee of
such board of directors of each of its Subsidiaries to include persons
designated by Parent constituting the same percentage of each such committee
or board as Parent\'s designees constitute on the Company Board.

  

  

(b) The Company\'s obligations under this Section 1.03 shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and
the Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Merger Sub\'s designees
to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. Merger Sub shall timely
furnish to the Company, and be solely responsible for, information with
respect to Merger Sub\'s designees and Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s respective
officers, directors and affiliates to the extent such information is required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 or as otherwise provided to the Company by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In the event that Parent\'s designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.03 then, until the Effective Time,
the Company and Parent shall (i) cause the Company Board to maintain at least
three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board on the date of this
Agreement and who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act (the "Independent Directors"), (ii) allow the Independent
Directors who are members of the audit committee of the Company Board
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement to remain as the sole members
of the audit committee of the Company Board and (iii) cause such audit
committee to comply with all requirements of Federal Securities Laws and
Nasdaq applicable thereto. If any Independent Director is unable to serve due
to death, disability or resignation, then the remaining Independent Directors
(or, if no Independent Director is then in office, the members of the Company
Board) shall be entitled to elect or appoint another individual to fill each
such vacancy, which individual shall not be an officer, director, employee or
agent of, or otherwise an Affiliate of, Parent or Merger Sub and shall
otherwise satisfy all requirements of Federal Securities Laws and Nasdaq
applicable to a member of an audit committee, and each such individual shall
be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement; it
being further understood and agreed that if any Independent Director that is
so unable to serve was a member of the audit committee of the Company Board,
the Independent Director appointed to fill such vacancy shall serve as a
member of the audit committee. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, from and after the time, if any, that Parent\'s designees
pursuant to this Section 1.03 constitute a majority of the Company Board and
prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors, acting qua audit committee of the Company Board, shall
be required and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the WBCL, be
sufficient to (i) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the
Company or to amend or modify the terms or conditions of the Offer or the
Merger, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Company\'s rights or remedies under
this Agreement, (iii) extend the time for performance of Parent\'s or Merger
Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement, (iv) enforce any obligation of Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement or (v) take any other action of the Company
Board under or in connection with this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the holders of Shares
(other than Parent or Merger Sub). The Independent Directors, acting qua audit
committee of the Company Board, shall have the authority to retain counsel
(which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the
expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the Independent Directors
and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Time and prior to the
Effective Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

Section 1.04 Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable upon the terms and conditions of this Section 1.04, to
purchase from the Company a number of newly-issued shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute one (1) share more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the
issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option or
(ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is
authorized to issue under its Charter Documents but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise reserved to be issued
under Company Stock Plans) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once, in whole and not in part
at or following the Acceptance Time and at any time prior to the earlier to
occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms; provided, however, that (A) the Top-Up Option shall
not be exercisable unless the Minimum Condition has been satisfied and Merger
Sub reasonably determines that, immediately after such exercise and the
issuance of Top-Up Shares, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming
the issuance of the Top-Up Shares), and (B) notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable and
shall terminate (x) at the Acceptance Time if the number of Top-Up Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of
authorized but unissued (and not reserved to be issued under Company Stock
Plans) shares of Company Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued
shares of Company Common Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.04(b), any
shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) or (y) if
any judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares or (z) upon the termination
of the Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

(c) The aggregate amount payable to the Company by Merger Sub for the Top-Up
Shares shall be equal to the product of the number of Top-Up Shares and the
Offer Price (the "Top-Up Consideration"). The Top-Up Consideration shall
consist of (i) an amount equal to the par value of the Top-Up Shares, to be
paid in cash, and (ii) an amount equal to the balance of the Top-Up
Consideration, which may be paid in the sole discretion of Parent and Merger
Sub (x) in cash or (y) by issuance of a promissory note (which shall be
treated as payment for the Top-Up Shares to the extent of the principal amount
thereof) with full recourse to Parent, or any combination of the foregoing.
Any such promissory note shall (A) accrue simple interest at the rate per
annum of 5.0%, (B) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note, (C) may be prepaid at any time
and from time to time, without premium or penalty, (D) shall provide that the
unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory note shall
immediately become due and payable in the event that (1) Merger Sub fails to
make any payment on the promissory note as provided therein and such failure
continues for a period of thirty (30) days or (2) Merger Sub files or has
filed against it any petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes
a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and (E) shall have no other
material terms. The Company Board has determined that the Top-Up Consideration
is adequate in accordance with the WBCL and otherwise taken all steps
necessary such that upon issuance and delivery in accordance with this Section
1.04 the Top-Up Option Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable. The parties acknowledge and agree that for all purposes of this
Agreement and Annex III, any listing rule or requirement of any national
securities exchange shall not be deemed to prohibit or make illegal the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall give the Company written notice, and shall set forth in such notice (i)
the number of Shares that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately
preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (including the Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer), (ii) the place and time for the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (iii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and
(iv) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the Top-Up Consideration.
Such notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub
that Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as
practicable after such exercise of the Top-Up Option and the delivery by the
Company of the Top-Up Shares, consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms hereof. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent or
Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the Top-Up
Consideration, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger
Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

  

  

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock
resulting from the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or any promissory note issued
to pay any portion of the purchase price for such Top-Up Shares will not be
taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 180.1301 of the WBCL as contemplated by Section
3.07 of this Agreement and none of the Parties shall take any position to the
contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

The Merger

  

  

Section 2.01 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the WBCL, at the Effective Time, (a)
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), and (b) the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue its corporate existence under the WBCL as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

Section 2.02 Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00
a.m., New York time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder,
waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII in each case,
by the party entitled to the benefit thereof (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all such
conditions in each case, by the party entitled to the benefit thereof), unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Robinson and Cole LLP, 280 Trumbull
Street, Hartford, Connecticut 06103, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto, and the actual date of the Closing is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.03 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the "WDFI") in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the WBCL and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the WBCL. The Merger will become
effective at such date and time as specified in the Articles of Merger filed
with the WDFI or at such later date or time as is permitted by the WBCL and as
may be agreed by the Company and Parent in writing and specified in the
Articles of Merger in accordance with the WBCL (the date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time"). Notwithstanding the terms of Section 2.07, if following the Acceptance
Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" made in accordance
with this Agreement, if applicable, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if
applicable, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries collectively
own the minimum number of Shares, as necessary for Merger Sub to be merged
into the Company pursuant to Section 180.1104 of the WBCL (the "Short-Form
Threshold"), the parties shall take such necessary and appropriate actions in
order to cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter in accordance with Section 180.1104 of the WBCL without
convening the Company Shareholders Meeting.

  

  

Section 2.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the WBCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the
Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 2.05 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. The articles of incorporation
of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be,
from and after the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation. The bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The articles of incorporation and bylaws, as so amended shall be the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the terms thereof or as provided by applicable Law
(and, in each case, subject to Section 6.07 hereof).

  

  

Section 2.06 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors of
the Company, shall be replaced with the directors of Merger Sub, who shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers, of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case, until their successors have been duly appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.07 Company Shareholders Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Materials.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, if, after the Acceptance
Time, approval of the shareholders of the Company is required under applicable
Law to consummate the Merger, the Company shall take all action necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Acceptance Time. In connection
therewith, the Company shall mail the letter to shareholders, notice of
meeting, proxy statement and forms of proxy (such items collectively, the
"Company Proxy Statement") to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance
of such meeting. Subject to Section 6.04 hereof, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from the holders of Company Common
Stock (other than holders of Tendered Shares) proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (and, if such proxies are
insufficient to approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, then upon the request of Parent prior to the time of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall take all reasonable actions to
cause the Company Shareholders Meeting to be adjourned to permit solicitation
of additional proxies by the Company in favor of approval), and (ii) take all
other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such
approval. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub updated on a current
basis with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by Parent or
Merger Sub. Once the Company Shareholders Meeting has been called and noticed,
the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting
without the consent of Parent (other than (i) in order to obtain a quorum of
its shareholders or (ii) as reasonably determined by the Company (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) in order to comply with
applicable Law). At the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by them in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
shall not be required to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting if this
Agreement is terminated before the Acceptance Time or the Merger is able to be
consummated pursuant to Section 180.1104 of the WBCL.

  

  

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of the Acceptance Time, but in any event no
later than the third (3) Business Day after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will promptly furnish to the
Company all information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Company
Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the Company Proxy Statement, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which
comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
to resolve (and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other
party in resolving), all SEC comments with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement and to cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive form to be
cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Company\'s shareholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to
consult with Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel prior to responding to SEC
comments with respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its shareholders an amendment or supplement setting forth
such correction. The Company shall, promptly (and in any event, within one (1)
Business Day) following receipt (i) notify Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the
Company Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of all written correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement.

ARTICLE III

  

  

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock

  

  

Section 3.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

  

  

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or
otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 3.01(a)) will be
converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the Offer Price paid in
the Offer, in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

  

  

(c) Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all shares of Company Common
Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, each holder
of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) formerly
representing any such shares (each, a "Certificate") will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.02 hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the
agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i) the
Certificates; or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Book-Entry
Shares"). Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, in a separate
account for the benefit of the holders of Shares, sufficient funds to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry
Shares (the "Payment Fund"). If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to make the aggregate cash payments required by
Section 3.01(b). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions in customary form
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent\'s message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III,
each Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be instructed to comply with the
letter of transmittal and instructions referred to in Section 3.02(b) in order
to receive the cash to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article III.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any other Person
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

  

  

Section 3.03 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of
capital stock of the Company as expressly permitted by this Agreement),
including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, and, as a result,
an equitable adjustment to the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration is
required, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and applicable Treasury Regulations, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

  

Section 3.05 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this
Article III.

  

  

Section 3.06 Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-based Compensation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of that Company Stock Option or any other Person, cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second payroll period after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price under such
Company Stock Option, less any amounts required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 3.04; provided that to the extent that the exercise price of any
Company Stock Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled upon the Effective Time without any payment
being made in respect thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit award and other right, contingent or accrued,
to acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
the value of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of
Company Common Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or
reserved for issuance under any Company Stock Plan (as defined below), other
than Company Stock Options (each, a "Company Stock Award") immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Award or any other Person,
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the second payroll period after
the Effective Time, an amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such Company Stock Award
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less any amounts required to be
withheld in accordance with Section 3.04.

  

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any participant
consents) that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 3.06, and shall terminate all of the Company Stock
Plans, effective as of, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time.
As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options and Company Stock Awards
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Stock Option
or Company Stock Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive payment pursuant to this Section 3.06.

  

  

(d) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option and/or Company Stock
Award informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on such equity awards

Section 3.07 Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) It is anticipated that on the record date fixed for purposes of
determining the holders of Shares entitled to receive notice of, and to vote
at, a meeting to approve this Agreement (or for purposes of determining
whether the Merger may be consummated without a shareholder vote under Section
180.1104 of the WBCL), the Shares will continue to be quoted on Nasdaq.
Accordingly, holders of Shares will not have dissenters' rights under Section
180.1302 of the WBCL in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Section 3.07(b) and Section 3.07(c) below shall apply in the event
that holders of Shares do have dissenters' rights, whether because the Shares
are no longer quoted on Nasdaq on such record date or otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are held by any record holder who has not voted to approve this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to assert dissenters' rights
under Section 180.1302 of the WBCL and who has asserted dissenters' rights in
accordance with Section 180.1301 et seq. of the WBCL (the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but
shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
WBCL; provided, however, that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have
failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost such shareholder's
dissenters' rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares, in each case under
the WBCL, shall forfeit such shareholder's dissenters' rights with respect to
such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 3.07(b), if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned,
then the right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such
shareholder's Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall
comply with all of its obligations under the WBCL with respect to holders of
Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of any notices of
intent to demand payment, any withdrawals of such notices received by the
Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the WBCL and
received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment under
Section 180.1301 et seq. of the WBCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as appropriate to

controls and procedures prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company\'s
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Company\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company\'s internal controls over financial reporting. For

Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or
among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company SEC
Documents or Company Financial Statements.

  

  

(f) Sarbanes-Oxley Compliance. Each of the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were true and accurate in all
material respects on the date such certifications were made and as of the date
of this Agreement, respectively. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have outstanding (and have not arranged or modified) any
"extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under
the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is
otherwise in compliance with all applicable listing and corporate governance
rules of Nasdaq, except where the failure to be in compliance has not had, and

Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal, any request for discussions, negotiations, access to non-public

discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide Parent with a list of any
non-public information concerning the Company\'s business, present or future
performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to any
third party, and, to the extent such information has not been previously
provided to Parent, copies of such information. The Company agrees that it and

hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.04, effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that (A) failure to take such action would be inconsistent with, or a breach
or violation of, the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws and (B)
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (y) in the case of
Section 6.04(b)(ii), in response to a Takeover Proposal made after the date
hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.04, cause or permit
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a) and, in
connection with such termination, authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable such Superior Proposal, and cause or permit the Company or
any Subsidiary to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
thereto, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that (A) failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with, or a breach or violation of, the
directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws and (B) such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that prior to
effecting any Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a), (1) the Company has given notice to
Parent, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the "Notice Period")
before taking such action, of its intention to take such action with respect
to a Takeover Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company
has received a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a
Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto; (2) the Company attaches to such
notice the most current unredacted version of the relevant proposed
transaction agreement(s) and a copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto and a written summary of the material terms of any Superior Proposal
not made in writing, including any financing commitments relating thereto
(which version shall be updated on a prompt basis); (3) after providing such
notice and prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a),
the Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, during
the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
Company not to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04(a); (4) following the end of such
Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall
have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect; provided that, in
the event of any material revisions to the Takeover Proposal that the Company
Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this Section 6.04(f) de novo.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Any breach of this Section 6.04 by a Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.04 by the
Company.

shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the
Company, promptly of (i) any material notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in

material notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any
Legal Actions commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or to the
Knowledge of Parent (as applicable) threatened, against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) any
event, change or effect between the date of this Agreement and (x) the
Acceptance Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure of
any Offer Condition to be satisfied as of the Acceptance Time or (y) the
Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure in
any material respect of the conditions set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied at the Effective Time. In no event shall the delivery of any notice
by a party pursuant to this Section 6.05 cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the
party receiving such notice. This Section 6.05 shall not constitute a covenant
or agreement for purposes of Section 8.02(b) or Section 8.03(b).

Section 6.07 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company
Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof, shall be assumed
by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding
is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final
disposition of such proceeding or claim.

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the "Indemnifying
Parties") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party to
the same extent provided in the Charter Documents and all indemnification
agreements with Indemnified Parties as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, to the extent copies have been provided or made available to Parent
prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Corporation\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company
as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time with coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as the coverage, amounts, terms and conditions provided by the
Company to its directors and officers as of the date of this Agreement, in
each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that in no
event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium
for such coverage in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date
of this Agreement, which amount is set forth in Section 6.07(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the "Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot
be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium,
the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, that amount of directors\' and officers\' insurance (or
"tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.07 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.07 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 6.07 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.07, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.07).

  

  

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this
Section 6.07 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in
this Section 6.07. In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, unless
provided by operation of Law, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

  

  

(f) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers,
directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.07 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

third parties that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and to fully

Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the
other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section
6.08(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided

Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any
other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (provided that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such
filing shall be made no later than ten (10) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) subject to the terms
set forth in Section 6.08(c) hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58

instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects and shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such

by this Agreement.

obtaining title commitments, title policies and surveys in connection with the

indemnity or other assurances reasonably requested by the title company to
issue such title policies.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub or the Company

material Contracts, businesses, product lines, products or assets, including

respect to any of its businesses, (iii) consent to any disposition of its
assets or limits on its freedom of action with respect to any of its
businesses, (iv) constitute or implement any proxy board, or (v) commit or
agree to any of the foregoing and, except with the prior written consent of

Company and Parent. Thereafter, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be permitted
by Section 6.04 or required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable United States securities exchange or Governmental Entity to

or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any
executive officer, key employee or advisor of the Company or any such
participant as a script in discussions or meetings with any such third
parties, the Company shall (or shall cause any such participant to) provide
such communication to Parent and allow Parent a reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon, and shall consult in good faith with Parent for purposes of
determining whether that communication constitutes "soliciting material" that
is required to be filed by Rule 14a 6(b) or Rule 14a 12(b) of the Exchange
Act. The Company shall (or shall cause any such participant to) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent on any

by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.02(c) or (B) by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.03(b) and (ii) the Termination Fee has not been paid to
Parent, or one or more Persons designated by Parent, then the Company shall,

shall not be required to pay more than an aggregate of $2,750,000 in Parent

of any subsequent obligation to pay the applicable Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.06(a), (b) or (c), as the case may be, provided that the amount of
the Termination Fee payable by the Company will be decreased by the amount of
Parent Expenses actually reimbursed pursuant to this Section 8.06(e).

representations and warranties of the other party(ies) contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered under this Agreement, or (c) unless
prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the

assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute
a waiver of such rights.

Greenbriar Equity Fund II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Greenbriar
Equity Fund II-A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Greenbriar Co-
Investment Partners II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (each, a
"Guarantor") and together, the "Guarantors"), in favor of EDAC Technologies
Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Guaranteed Party").

  

  

Reference is hereby made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of the date hereof (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement") by and among the
Guaranteed Party, GB Aero Engine LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Parent"), and GB Aero Engine Merger Sub Inc., a Wisconsin corporation
("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Merger Sub has agreed to (i) commence a
tender offer for all of the outstanding Shares (the "Offer") and (ii) if the
Offer is completed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, merge with and into the Guaranteed Party (the "Merger"),
with the Guaranteed Party surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Guarantor. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  


 

  

1. GUARANTEE. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Guarantors, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally, guarantee to the Guaranteed Party, but only up to the Cap (as defined below), on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the due and punctual payment, observance, performance and discharge of (i) any payment obligations relating to or resulting from a breach or violation of any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii) all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) reasonably incurred by the Guaranteed Party in connection with the enforcement of its rights under the Merger Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"); provided that in no event shall the Guarantors' aggregate liability under this Limited Guarantee exceed $141,768,998.81 less (a) the amount of consideration actually paid by Parent or Merger Sub to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of Tendered Shares less (b) the Merger Consideration actually paid by Parent or Merger Sub to holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.02(a) of the Merger Agreement, less (c) amounts actually paid to the holders of Company Stock Options or Company Stock Awards, in each case in accordance with Section 3.06 of the Merger Agreement (such amount, the "Cap"), it being understood that in no event shall this Limited Guarantee be enforced without giving effect to the Cap. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. Subject to the Cap and the last sentence of Section 3 hereof, each of Guarantors promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of any kind.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Limited Guarantee,
the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall be several, not joint and
several, based upon its respective Pro Rata Amount, and no Guarantor shall be
liable for any amount hereunder in excess of its Pro Rata Amount of the amount
payable by the Guarantors hereunder. The "Pro Rata Amount" for each Guarantor
is as set forth below:

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

Name of Investor

  |  |  

Pro Rata Amount

  |   
---|---|---|--- 
  

Greenbriar Equity Fund II, L.P.

  |  | $ | 105,495,273.93 |   
  

Greenbriar Equity Fund II-A, L.P.

  |  | $ | 35,165,091.31 |   
  

Greenbriar Co-Investment Partners II, L.P.

  |  | $ | 1,108,633.57 |   
 

  


 

  


 

  

The Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that in no event shall any Guarantor be
required to pay any Person under, in respect of, or in connection with this
Limited Guarantee, more than the such Guarantor's Pro Rata Amount (subject to
the Cap, as proportionally applied to each Guarantor, based on their relative
Pro Rata Amounts) and that no Guarantor shall have any obligation or liability
to any Person relating to, arising out of or in connection with, this Limited
Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or such Guarantor's Equity Commitment other
than as expressly set forth herein or in the Equity Commitment Letter. All
payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States in
immediately available funds. Each of the Guarantors promises and undertakes to
make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense,
claim or counterclaim of any kind.

  

  

If Parent or Merger Sub fails to discharge its Guaranteed Obligations when
due, the Guaranteed Party may at any time and from time to time, at the
Guaranteed Party's option, and so long as Parent or Merger Sub has failed to
perform any of its Guaranteed Obligations, take any and all actions available
hereunder or under applicable Law to enforce Guarantors' payment obligations
hereunder in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations, subject to the Cap.

  

  

In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Guarantors acknowledges that the
Guaranteed Party may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate
action or actions against the Guarantors for the full amount of Guarantors'
liabilities hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (subject to the
Cap), regardless of whether action is brought against Parent or the Merger Sub
or whether Parent or Merger Sub is joined in any such action or actions.

  

  

Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a) with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub, the Guaranteed Party shall have the rights and remedies specified
in, and subject to the limitations set forth in, the Merger Agreement and (b)
with respect to the Guarantors, the Guaranteed Party shall have the rights and
remedies specified in, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this
Limited Guarantee.

  

  

2. NATURE OF GUARANTEE. Subject to the Cap, this Limited Guarantee is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not merely of collection. Each Guarantor's liability hereunder is absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective of any modification, amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Merger Agreement or the Equity Commitments that may be agreed to by Parent or Merger Sub. Without limiting the foregoing, the Guaranteed Party shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall not affect such Guarantor's obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever (other than as set forth in the last sentence of Section 8), each Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder as if such payment had not been made.

3. CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS. Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Party may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of any Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Parent or Merger Sub for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or affecting Guarantor's obligations under this Limited Guarantee or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Limited Guarantee; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Limited Guarantee is intended to modify or supersede the provisions of the Merger Agreement as between the Guaranteed Party, Parent and Merger Sub. Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) any failure or delay on the part of the Guaranteed Party in asserting any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement (other than amendments to the Guaranteed Obligations or any Equity Commitments) made in accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) any change in the legal existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (e) without derogating from the Guaranteed Party's obligations under the penultimate paragraph of Section 1 hereof, any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (f) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which such Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, Merger Sub or the Guaranteed Party, whether in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; (g) the adequacy of any other means the Guaranteed Party may have of obtaining payment related to the Guaranteed Obligations; (h) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity, illegality or enforceability of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; or (i) any change in the Laws of any jurisdiction.

  

  

Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

  

  

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to assert any
rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against Parent or Merger Sub
that arise from the existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of such
Guarantor's obligations under or in respect of this Limited Guarantee or any
other agreement in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any
right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Guaranteed Party against Parent or Merger Sub, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common Law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from Parent,
directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any
other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right,
unless and until all the Guaranteed Obligations (subject to the Cap) have been
paid in full in immediately available funds. If any amount shall be paid to a
Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior
to satisfaction in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations, such amount
shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Party,
shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and shall
forthwith be promptly paid or delivered to the Guaranteed Party in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, or to be held as
collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations thereafter arising. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Limited Guarantee, the Guaranteed
Party hereby agrees that (i) to the extent any of Parent or Merger Sub\'s
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger
Agreement are waived by the Guaranteed Party or otherwise satisfied, then each
Guarantor shall be similarly relieved of its corresponding Guaranteed
Obligations and (ii) Guarantor shall have all defenses to the payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations that would be available to Parent or Merger Sub under
the Merger Agreement.

4. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS. No failure on the part of the Guaranteed Party to exercise or pursue, and no delay in exercising or pursuing, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Guaranteed Party of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder; nor relieve the Guarantors of any liability hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Guaranteed Party or allowed it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Party at any time or from time to time. The Guaranteed Party shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of the Guaranteed Party's rights against, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person now or hereafter liable for any Guaranteed Obligations or interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement prior to proceeding against Guarantor hereunder.

  

  

5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants as to itself that:

  

  

(a) it is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization;

  

  

(b) it has all requisite corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Limited
Guarantee and the execution, delivery and performance of this Limited

material obligation or the loss of any material benefit under any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, contract, permit, franchise, right or license
binding on the Guarantor or result in the creation of any lien upon any of its
properties, assets or rights, or (B) conflict with or result in any violation
of or contravene any provision of the Guarantor's charter, partnership
agreement, operating agreement or similar organizational documents or any Law
binding on the Guarantor or any of its property or assets;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) all consents, approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with and
notifications to, any governmental authority necessary for the due execution,
delivery and performance of this Limited Guarantee by such Guarantor have been
obtained or made and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and
no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
authority or regulatory body is required in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this Limited Guarantee;

  

  

(d) this Limited Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Guarantor enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and

  

  

(e) such Guarantor has uncalled capital commitments equal to or in excess of
the amount of its respective Pro Rata Amount and all funds necessary for such
Guarantor to fulfill its Guaranteed Obligations under this Limited Guarantee
shall be available to such Guarantor (or its permitted assignee pursuant to
Section 6 hereof) for so long as this Limited Guarantee shall remain in effect
in accordance with Section 8 hereof.

  

  

6. NO ASSIGNMENT. None of the Guarantors nor the Guaranteed Party may assign or delegate their rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person (except by operation of Law) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, each Guarantor can assign its rights, interests and obligations with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Guaranteed Party, to an Affiliate of such Guarantor to which it has allocated all or a portion of its investment commitment to Parent pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of, the Equity Commitment Letter to which such Guarantor is a party; provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 6 shall be null and void.

Subject to the last sentence of Section 3 hereof and unless otherwise terminated in accordance with this Section 8, this Limited Guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantors, their successors and assigns until the complete and indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (subject to the Cap). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Limited Guarantee shall terminate and the Guarantors shall have no further obligations under this Limited Guarantee as of the earliest of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) receipt in full by the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates of the Guaranteed Obligations, (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms by mutual consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company unless, in the case of this clause (iii), the Guaranteed Party has provided written notice to the Guarantors pursuant to Section 7 asserting a claim by the Guaranteed Party prior to such date, in which case the relevant date shall be the date that such claim is finally satisfied or otherwise resolved by agreement of the parties hereto or a final, non-appealable judgment of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction; provided that such claim shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such claim and the Guarantor shall not be required to pay any claim not submitted on or before the three month anniversary of such termination of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of Section 1 hereof limiting each Guarantor's liability to its Pro Rata Amount of the Cap or the provisions of this Section 8 or Section 9 hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, asserts that Guarantor is liable for Guaranteed Obligations in excess of or to a greater extent than the Cap or asserts any theory of liability against Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement other than liability of (x) any Person to the Guaranteed Party pursuant to any Retained Claims (as hereinafter defined) or (y) Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee (as limited by the provisions of Section 1), then (I) the obligations of Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee shall terminate ab initio and be null and void, (II) if a Guarantor has previously made any payments under this Limited Guarantee, it shall be entitled to recover such payments and (III) neither any of the Guarantors nor any Non-Recourse Party shall have any liability to the Guaranteed Party with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or under this Limited Guarantee.

9. NO RECOURSE. The Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any assets other than their respective rights under the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitments, and that no additional funds are expected to be contributed to Parent unless and until the Acceptance Time occurs. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Limited Guarantee or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or otherwise, and notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantors may each be a partnership, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Limited Guarantee, the Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that no Person other than the Guarantors and the Guaranteed Party (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) has any rights or obligations hereunder and that no recourse shall be had hereunder or under any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation, against, and no personal liability shall attach to, the former, current and future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, representatives or successors or assignees of any Guarantor, or any former, current or future equity holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate (other than Parent or Merger Sub), member, manager, general or limited partner, representative, successor or assignee of any of the foregoing (such parties (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub), each a "Non-Recourse Party", and collectively the "Non-Recourse Parties"), through Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of the Guaranteed Party against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise, except for (w) claims by the Guaranteed Party against any of the Guarantors under and to the extent provided in this Limited Guarantee and subject to the Cap ("Retained Guarantee Claims"), (x) claims by the Guaranteed Party against Parent or Merger Sub under and in accordance with the Merger Agreement ("Retained Merger Agreement Claims"), (y) claims by the Guaranteed Party pursuant to its third-party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, including its right to cause the commitments under the Equity Commitment Letter to be funded in accordance with the terms thereof ("Retained ECL Claims") and (z) claims against Greenbriar Equity Group LLC under the Confidentiality Agreement ("Retained Confidentiality Claims", and together with Retained Guarantee Claims, Retained Merger Agreement Claims and Retained ECL Claims, "Retained Claims"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Guarantor (A) consolidates with or merges with any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any Person such that the sum of the Guarantor's remaining net assets plus uncalled capital is less than such Guarantor's Pro Rata Amount of the Cap (less amounts paid by such Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee prior to such event), then, and in each such case, the Guaranteed Party may seek recourse, whether by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or by virtue of any applicable Law, against such continuing or surviving entity or such Person (in either case, a "Successor Entity"), as the case may be. As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the term "Guarantor" includes such Guarantor's Successor Entity.

Recourse against a Guarantor solely with respect to the Retained Guarantee
Claims and the Retained ECL Claims, against Parent or Merger Sub solely with
respect to the Retained Merger Agreement Claims and against Greenbriar Equity
Group LLC solely with respect to the Retained Confidentiality Claims shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Guaranteed Party and all of its
Affiliates against the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and all Non-Recourse
Parties in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or any of the other agreements
contemplated thereby, or the transactions contemplated thereby, and such
recourse shall be subject to the limitations described herein and therein.
Nothing set forth in this Limited Guarantee shall confer or give or shall be
construed to confer or give to any Person (including any Person acting in a
representative capacity) any rights or remedies against any Person other than
Guarantors as expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Guaranteed Party hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, and shall make or cause
to be made adequate provision such that their respective successors and
assignees shall not, directly or indirectly, institute any proceeding or bring
any claim arising under, or in connection with, this Limited Guaranty, the
Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, against the Guarantor or any Non-Recourse
Party except for (i) Retained Guarantee Claims brought by the Guaranteed Party
against the Guarantors, (ii) Retained Merger Agreement Claims brought by the
Guaranteed Party against Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) Retained ECL Claims
brought by the Guaranteed Party against the Guarantors and (iv) Retained
Confidentiality Claims brought by the Guaranteed Party against Greenbriar
Equity Group LLC. The Guaranteed Party acknowledges that Guarantors are
agreeing to enter into this Limited Guarantee in reliance on the provisions
set forth in this Section 9. This Section 9 shall survive the termination of
this Limited Guarantee.

The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding (i) in the case of Guarantors or the undersigned, to the address set forth above and (ii) in the case of the Guaranteed Party, to the address set forth in the Merger Agreement or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid, effective and sufficient service thereof.

11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH.

  

  

12. COUNTERPARTS. This Limited Guarantee may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic transmission), and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

13. MISCELLANEOUS.

the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions,
negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether
written or oral, among the Guarantors or any of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand. No modification or waiver of any provision hereof shall be

(b) Any term or provision of this Limited Guarantee that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be, as to such jurisdiction,
ineffective solely to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction; provided, however,
that this Limited Guarantee may not be enforced without giving effect to the
limitation of the amount payable hereunder to the Cap provided in Section 1
hereof (subject to the last paragraph of Section 1) and to the provisions of
Sections 8 and 9 hereof. No party hereto shall assert, and each party shall
cause its respective Affiliates not to assert, that this Limited Guarantee or

enacted by a Governmental Entity that prohibits or makes illegal the

if made at and as of such time (except those representations and warranties
that address matters only as of a particular date, which shall be true and
correct in all respects as of that date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (y) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Section 4.02(a), Section 4.02(b)(i) and Section 4.05(a)
are not true and correct in all material respects when made and as of
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, as if made at and as of such time
