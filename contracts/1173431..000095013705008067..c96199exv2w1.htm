ARTICLE I    

THE PURCHASE AND SALE    

 SECTION 1.1. _General_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, TD shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Ameritrade, and Ameritrade shall purchase from TD, all of the then-outstanding shares of Waterhouse Common Stock, representing all of the capital stock of Waterhouse.    

 SECTION 1.2. _Share Exchange_. In exchange for the shares of Waterhouse Common Stock transferred to Ameritrade at the Closing, Ameritrade shall, at the Closing, (i) issue and deliver to TD 193,600,000 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (the " _Exchange Consideration_ ") and (ii) pay to TD, by bank check or wire transfer to an account designated by TD at least two Business Days prior to the Closing, cash in the amount of $20,000 (the " _Cash Consideration_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Ameritrade shall pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock, subdivide, split or combine the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock or issue additional shares of Common Stock by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock, then    ##### 

 

 

3   

the number of shares of Common Stock constituting the Exchange Consideration
shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock constituting
the Exchange Consideration immediately prior to the occurrence of such
event multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after, and the
denominator of which shall be the number of such shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately before, the occurrence of such event, and the
resulting product shall from and after the date of such event be the Exchange
Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence
in the event of any subsequent such dividend, subdivision, split, combination
or reclassification.    

 SECTION 1.3. _Closing Date Capital Adjustment_.    

 (a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Ameritrade will prepare and deliver to TD the information set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) below:     

 (i) for Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries, a consolidated balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the " _Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). The Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet shall (A) be prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to the exceptions described below and in Section 1.3(a)(i)(A) of the disclosure schedule delivered by TD to Ameritrade concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _TD Disclosure Schedule_ ")), applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Waterhouse 2004 Financial Statements, (B) reflect the Reorganization, (C) reflect the accruals set forth in Section 1.3(a)(i)(C) of the TD Disclosure Schedule and (D) be accompanied by a statement showing Waterhouses Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value and Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, in each case based on the Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet. TD will assist and cooperate with Ameritrade in the preparation of the Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet, including by providing Ameritrade with reasonable access to any relevant personnel, books and records related to Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries that are in TDs possession.    

 (ii) for Ameritrade and its Subsidiaries, a consolidated balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the " _Ameritrade Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " and, together with the Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet, the " _Closing Date Balance Sheets_ "). The Ameritrade Closing Date Balance Sheet shall (A) be prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to the exceptions described below and in Section 1.3(a)(ii)(A) of the disclosure schedule delivered by Ameritrade to TD concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Ameritrade Disclosure Schedule_ ")), applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the most recent audited financial statements of Ameritrade included in the Ameritrade SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) reflect the payment or accrual of any Special Dividend (including any Special Dividend with a record date prior to the Closing that will be paid following the Closing) up to an amount equal to the product of $1.00 and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding as of the record date of any such Special Dividend (and not reflect the payment of any portion of the Special Dividend in excess of such amount), (C)   ##### 

 

 

4   

not reflect any Special Dividend Indebtedness (or any proceeds received
therefrom), except to the extent such Special Dividend Indebtedness exceeds
an amount equal to the product of $4.00 and the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock actually outstanding as of the record date of the Special
Dividend, in which case the amount of such excess shall be reflected
(but such amount shall in no event duplicate any accrual already reflected in
(B) above), (D) reflect the adjustments set forth on Section 1.3(a)(ii)(D) of
the Ameritrade Disclosure Schedule and (E) be accompanied by a statement
showing Ameritrades Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value and Targeted
Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, in each case based on the Ameritrade
Closing Date Balance Sheet. The calculations of Ameritrades and Waterhouses
respective Closing Date Net Tangible Book Values and Targeted Closing Date
Net Tangible Book Values which accompany the Closing Date Balance Sheets are
referred to collectively herein as the " _Calculations_."   

 (b) Following the delivery by Ameritrade to TD of the Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Calculations, TD shall have a period of 30 days in which to review the Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Calculations. TD and its accountants shall be provided with reasonable access to the work papers of Ameritrade and its accountants and to the books and records of Ameritrade and its Subsidiaries and Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries in connection with such review. In the event that TD determines that either of the Closing Date Balance Sheets and/or any of the Calculations have not been prepared in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 1.3(a) (taking into account (i) the various enumerated items in Section 1.3(a)(i)(A) through (C), in the case of the Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii) the various enumerated items in Section 1.3(a)(ii)(A) through (D), in the case of the Ameritrades Closing Date Balance Sheet, and (iii) the defined terms contained therein), TD shall, on or before the last day of such 30-day period, inform Ameritrade in writing of such determination (the " _TD Objection_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail a specific description of the basis of the TD Objection, the adjustments to the applicable Closing Date Balance Sheets which TD believes should be made, and, if different from Ameritrades calculation thereof, TDs calculation of the Calculations, and TD shall be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically disputed in the TD Objection. Failure to so notify Ameritrade shall constitute acceptance and approval of Ameritrades preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Calculations.    

 (c) Ameritrade shall then have 30 days following the date it receives the TD Objection to review and respond to the TD Objection, during which period Ameritrade and TD shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the TD Objection. If Ameritrade and TD are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of the foregoing items by the 30th day following the date on which Ameritrade receives the TD Objection, after having used their good faith efforts to reach a resolution, then TD and Ameritrade shall each submit the name of an accounting firm that is nationally recognized in the United States (other than the current independent auditors of either TD or Ameritrade), and Ameritrade and TD shall mutually select one firm from these two firms (such selected firm, the " _CPA Firm_ "), who shall, acting as experts in accounting, determine on a basis consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 1.3(a) (taking into account (i) the various enumerated items in Section 1.3(a)(i)(A)    ##### 

 

 

5   

through (C), in the case of the Waterhouse Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii)
the various enumerated items in Section 1.3(a)(ii)(A) through (D), in the
case of the Ameritrade Closing Date Balance Sheet, and (iii) in each case the
applicable defined terms contained in Section 1.3(a)), and only with respect
to the specific remaining accounting-related differences so submitted,
whether and to what extent either of the Closing Date Balance Sheets and/or
any of the Calculations require adjustment. Each of TD and Ameritrade
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to,
provide full cooperation to the CPA Firm. Ameritrade and TD shall request the
CPA Firm to use all reasonable efforts to render its determination within 45
days following submission of such matters to the CPA Firm. The CPA
Firms determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Ameritrade and TD
and shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is enforceable pursuant to
the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. Ameritrade and TD shall
make reasonably available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records, any
work papers (including those of the parties respective accountants, to the
extent applicable) and supporting documentation relating to the Closing Date
Balance Sheets and the Calculations, and all other items reasonably requested
by the CPA Firm. The " _Final Statement_ " of each of Waterhouse and
Ameritrade shall mean, with respect to Waterhouse, the Waterhouse Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the calculations of Waterhouses Closing Date
Net Tangible Book Value and Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value,
and with respect to Ameritrade, the Ameritrade Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the calculations of Ameritrades Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value and
Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, in each case (i) as submitted
by Ameritrade pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in the event that (A) no TD Objection
is delivered to Ameritrade during the initial 30-day period specified above
or (B) Ameritrade and TD so agree, (ii) as adjusted in accordance with the TD
Objection, in the event that (A) Ameritrade does not respond to the TD
Objection during the 30-day period specified above following receipt
by Ameritrade of the TD Objection or (B) Ameritrade and TD so agree, (iii) as
adjusted in accordance with the agreement of Ameritrade and TD, if Ameritrade
and TD so agree during the 30-day period following receipt by Ameritrade of
the TD Objection, or (iv) as adjusted by the CPA Firm, if it has been
submitted to the CPA Firm for review, together with any other modifications to
the applicable Closing Date Balance Sheet or Calculations agreed upon by
Ameritrade and TD. All fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be shared
equally by Ameritrade and TD.    

 (d) If Waterhouses Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, as set forth in Waterhouses Final Statement, is less than its Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, TD shall pay to Ameritrade as a contribution to capital an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the excess of Waterhouses Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value over its Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, each as set forth in Waterhouses Final Statement, plus (ii) an amount calculated as if interest were payable on the amount paid under clause (i), computed at the daily effective Fed funds rate as published by the Federal Reserve (based on a 365-day year) (the " _Fed Funds Rate_ ") for the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the date of such payment, in immediately available funds no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the date on which Waterhouses Final Statement is determined pursuant to Section 1.3(c) above. If Waterhouses Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, as set forth in Waterhouses Final Statement, is greater than its Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, Ameritrade shall pay TD an amount in cash as additional consideration equal to the sum of (x) the excess of Waterhouses Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value over its Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, as set forth    ##### 

 

 

6   

in Waterhouses Final Statement, plus (y) an amount calculated as if interest
were payable on the amount paid under clause (x), computed at the Fed Funds
Rate for the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the date of such
payment, in immediately available funds no later than the sixtieth (60th) day
following the date on which Waterhouses Final Statement is
determined pursuant to Section 1.3(c) above.    

 (e) If Ameritrades Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, as set forth in Ameritrades Final Statement, is less than its Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, Ameritrade shall pay to TD an amount in cash as additional consideration equal to the sum of (i) (x) the quotient of (A) the excess of Ameritrades Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value over its Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, each as set forth in Ameritrades Final Statement, _divided by_ (B) 1 minus TDs Ownership Percentage (expressed as a decimal) _minus_ (y) the excess amount described in clause (A) above plus (ii) an amount calculated as if interest were payable on the amount paid under clause (i), computed at the Fed Funds Rate for the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the date of such payment, in immediately available funds no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the date on which Ameritrades Final Statement is determined pursuant to Section 1.3(c) above. If Ameritrades Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, as set forth in Ameritrades Final Statement, is greater than its Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, TD shall pay to Ameritrade as a capital contribution an amount in cash equal to the sum of (I)(x) the quotient of (aa) the excess of Ameritrades Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value over its Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value, as set forth in Ameritrades Final Statement, divided by (bb) 1 minus the Ownership Percentage (expressed as a decimal) minus (y) the excess amount described in clause (aa) above plus (II) an amount calculated as if interest were payable on the amount paid under clause (I), computed at the Fed Funds Rate for the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the date of such payment, in immediately available funds no later than the sixtieth (60th) day following the date on which Ameritrades Final Statement is determined pursuant to Section 1.3(c) above.    

 (f) TD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain (i) net capital (which amount is set forth in Box 3750 of the applicable Focus Report) of each of the Business Subsidiaries in excess of each such Business Subsidiarys respective Targeted Net Capital and (ii) Waterhouse Tangible Net Worth in excess of zero. Ameritrade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the net capital (which amount is set forth in Box 3750 of the applicable Focus Report) of each Subsidiary that is a registered broker-dealer in excess of its respective Targeted Net Capital.

Except as set forth in Section 4.16(i) of the Ameritrade Disclosure Schedule, there is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any current or former employee, director or consultant of Ameritrade or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

 SECTION 5.3. _Ameritrade Stockholders  Meeting_. (a) Ameritrade shall duly take all lawful action to call and give notice of, and shall use all reasonable efforts to convene and hold, a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining the Ameritrade Required Votes and any Additional Votes, and, subject to Section 5.3(c), shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit the approval of the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals by such stockholders. Ameritrade shall not fix, announce or change the record date for such meeting of its stockholders without TDs prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Board of Directors of Ameritrade shall recommend approval by such stockholders of the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals (the " _Ameritrade Recommendation_ "), shall cause the Ameritrade Recommendation to be included in the Proxy Statement, and shall not (nor shall any committee thereof) publicly withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to TD such recommendation (any such withdrawal, modification or qualification, a " _Change in Ameritrade Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.3(c). Notwithstanding any Change in Ameritrade Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals shall be submitted to the stockholders of Ameritrade at the Ameritrade Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of approving the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Ameritrade of such obligation, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Ameritrade may adjourn or postpone the Ameritrade Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the SEC Proxy Statement required by law is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals or if as of the time for which the Ameritrade Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Ameritrade Stockholders Meeting or there are insufficient affirmative votes to obtain the Ameritrade Required Votes and any Additional Votes. In addition to the foregoing, Ameritrade shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII.    

 (b) In addition to the proposals to approve the Ameritrade Stock Issuance and the Ameritrade Restated Charter, Ameritrade shall submit to its stockholders for a vote at the Ameritrade Stockholders Meeting, shall include in the SEC Proxy Statement and, subject to Section 5.3(c), shall use all reasonable efforts in compliance with applicable law to solicit the approval of its stockholders of, such other matters related to this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as TD may reasonably request, consistent with this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and subject to the consent of Ameritrade, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (collectively, the " _Additional Proposals_ "). Unless otherwise required by law or the bylaws of Ameritrade or mutually agreed by TD and Ameritrade, the vote required to approve any Additional Proposals shall be the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy and voting at a    ##### 

 

 

54    

meeting at which the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock are
present (in person or represented by proxy) (collectively, the " _Additional
Votes_ ").    

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Ameritrade Required Votes and any Additional Votes, Ameritrade and its Board of Directors may effect a Change in Ameritrade Recommendation if and only to the extent that:     

 (i) Ameritrade has not materially breached its obligations under the second sentence of Section 5.4(c);    

 (ii) Ameritrades Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside counsel and acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and    

 (iii) Ameritrade (A) has received, on or after the date of this Agreement, a _bona fide_  written Acquisition Proposal, not solicited in material violation of Section 5.4(a), from a third party which Ameritrades Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by TD pursuant to clause (C) below, (B) has notified TD, at least five Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Ameritrade Recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and furnishing to TD a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements, if such exist, with the Person making such Superior Proposal and all other material documents relating to such Superior Proposal and (C) during the period of not less than five Business Days following Ameritrades delivery of the notice referred to in clause (B) above and prior to effecting such a Change in Ameritrade Recommendation, has negotiated, and has used all reasonable efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with TD in good faith (to the extent that TD desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.   

 SECTION 5.4. _No Solicitations_. (a) Ameritrade agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative or agent (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, (A) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Ameritrade or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any such merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination resulting in or involving (x) the purchase or other acquisition by, or the sale or issuance to, any Person of securities representing (or convertible into or exchangeable for securities that would represent) less than 15% of the total voting power of Ameritrade or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) the purchase or sale of assets representing less than 15% of the aggregate fair market value of the consolidated assets    ##### 

 

 

55    

(including stock of Ameritrades Subsidiaries) of Ameritrade and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) any purchase or sale of assets
representing 15% or more of the aggregate fair market value of
the consolidated assets (including stock of Ameritrades Subsidiaries) of
Ameritrade and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) any purchase or
sale (by merger or otherwise) of, or tender or exchange offer for, securities
of Ameritrade that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning securities representing 15% or more of the total voting power of
Ameritrade or any of its " _Significant Subsidiaries_ " (as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X) (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than
a proposal or offer made by TD or an Affiliate thereof) being hereinafter
referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) have any discussions
with or provide any confidential information or data to any Person relating
to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make
or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (except as permitted
by Section 5.3(c)), (iv) execute or enter into, or (except as permitted by
Section 5.3(c)) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal, (v) grant any approval pursuant
to Section 203(a)(1) or Section 203(a)(3) of the DGCL or (vi) publicly
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Ameritrade shall advise its and
its Significant Subsidiaries directors and executive officers (as such term
is defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act, " _Executive Officers_ ") and
its and their Representatives of the restrictions contained in this Section
5.4 and shall instruct such Persons to comply herewith. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior
to obtaining the Ameritrade Required Votes and any Additional Votes,
Ameritrade receives a _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal not solicited in
material violation of Section 5.4(a) and its Board of Directors (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) concludes in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, Ameritrade may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
confidential information or data to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and participate in negotiations or discussions with such
Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal if and to the extent that the
Ameritrade Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that prior to providing (or
causing to be provided) any confidential information or data permitted to be
provided pursuant to this sentence, Ameritrade shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on confidentiality terms no
less favorable to Ameritrade than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
November 7, 2004, between TD and Ameritrade (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); and _provided_ _further_ , that Ameritrade shall also provide
to TD a copy of any such confidential information or data that it is
providing to any third party pursuant to this Section 5.4 to the extent not
previously provided or made available to TD.    

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal which the Ameritrade Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and    ##### 

 

 

56    

other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation), (x) is more favorable to the stockholders of Ameritrade, from
a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account the Ameritrade Board of Directors good faith
assessment of the prospective synergies and cost savings anticipated to be
realized from and following the Share Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) and (y) is fully financed or reasonably capable of
being fully financed and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on
the terms proposed;  _provided_ that for purposes of this definition of
"Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a), except that in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" (i) the reference to "15%" in clauses (A)(y) and (B)
shall be deemed to be a reference to "70%" (ii) the reference to "15%" in
clauses (A)(x) and (C) shall be deemed to be a reference to "40%" and (iii)
in order to qualify as an "Acquisition Proposal" under clauses (A)(x) or (C)
a transaction must involve voting securities only of Ameritrade and not of
its Subsidiaries or Significant Subsidiaries, as the case may be (other than
indirectly through the acquisition of voting securities of Ameritrade) (it
being understood that an Acquisition Proposal need only meet any of clauses
(A), (B) or (C) of the definition thereof (as modified by the foregoing
proviso) in order to be eligible to be determined to be a Superior Proposal
as provided above).    

 (c) (i) Ameritrade will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use all reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than TD with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) Ameritrade will use all reasonable efforts to enforce (and will not release any third party from its obligations under) any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential information previously furnished by Ameritrade thereunder and by using all reasonable efforts if reasonably requested by TD to seek injunctions or other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. Ameritrade will (x) promptly (but in no event more than two Business Days) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry which Ameritrade concludes in good faith has a reasonable possibility of leading to an Acquisition Proposal, advise TD of the material terms thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry in respect thereof), (y) keep TD apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis (and in any event, within 48 hours of the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations), and (z) furnish TD with a copy of any proposed transaction agreements and related documents with or from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry in respect thereof promptly after the receipt by Ameritrade thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Ameritrade shall provide TD with at least 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the Ameritrade Board of Directors) of any meeting of the Ameritrade Board of Directors at which meeting the Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal.    

 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Ameritrade or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with    ##### 

 

 

57    

respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will in no way
eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would
otherwise have under this Agreement; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any
such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Ameritrade Recommendation
unless the Ameritrade Board of Directors expressly reaffirms the Ameritrade
Recommendation in such disclosure.    

 (e) Ameritrade agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 by any director, officer, employee, agent or Representative of Ameritrade or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of Ameritrade or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4 by Ameritrade. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that participation by Ameritrade and its duly authorized directors, officers, employees, agents or Representatives in negotiations and discussions in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 5.4 with respect to an Acquisition Proposal following the receipt thereof shall not be deemed to constitute the solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal if such initial receipt was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of this Section 5.4, and notwithstanding any changes to such Acquisition Proposal that may result from such discussions or negotiations.    

 SECTION 5.5. _Legal Conditions_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of TD and Ameritrade shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Authority and any other third party which is required to be obtained or made by TD, Ameritrade or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Ameritrade and/or TD, as applicable, shall, as soon as practicable, make any initial filings required under the HSR Act and the Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Competition Filings_ "). The parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the Competition Filings; _provided_ , that with respect to any such analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals, each of Ameritrade and TD need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to such party requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information.    

 (b) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto, and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to, or additional information regarding, any such filings. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing    ##### 

 

 

58    

made pursuant to this Section 5.5, each party will promptly inform the other
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental
Authority such amendment or supplement. In addition, Ameritrade and TD shall,
to the extent permitted by law and the applicable Governmental Authority and
except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of Section 5.5(a), permit

If the parties are unable to reach agreement with the Commissioner of Competition regarding such a hold separate transaction, then Ameritrade shall effect a sale or other disposition of Ameritrade Canada, Inc. prior to the Closing on commercially reasonable terms.      ##### 

 

 

59       

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.5 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) so long as such party has until such date complied with its obligations under this Section 5.5.    

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.5, TD shall be under no obligation pursuant to this Section 5.5 to provide Ameritrade with any nonpublic information regarding TD or its Affiliates, other than Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries.

 SECTION 5.6. _Employee Benefit Plans_.    

 (a) Ameritrade and TD agree to cooperate reasonably during the period prior to the Closing Date to ensure the continuity of the workforce of Ameritrade and Waterhouse and to preserve the human resources thereof. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, TD agrees that Waterhouse shall not terminate any employee of Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries for any reason other than unsatisfactory job performance or misconduct. For a transition period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the later of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) 30 days following the clearing conversion of all Waterhouse client accounts following the Closing Date, as certified to TD by an Executive Officer of Ameritrade (such period, the " _Transition Period_ "), Ameritrade shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries, including any such employee who, on the Closing Date, is absent from work by reason of vacation, injury, sick leave, short-term disability, long-term disability, or due to authorized leave of absence or military service (collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ "), with (x) base salary and/or wage levels and bonus compensation at least equal to that provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (y) other employee benefits, including defined contribution pension benefits and equity based compensation, that are no less favorable    ##### 

 

 

60    

in the aggregate than such employee benefits provided by Ameritrade to
similarly situated employees of Ameritrade after the Closing Date. Nothing in
this Section 5.6(a) shall obligate Ameritrade or any of its Subsidiaries to
continue the employment of any Affected Employee for any period following the
Closing Date.    

 (b) During the Transition Period, Ameritrade shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to maintain a severance pay practice, program or arrangement for the benefit of each Affected Employee, including levels of severance and terms of severance, that is no less favorable than that provided by Waterhouse under such practice, program or arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to such Affected Employee, subject to Section 5.6(g) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, during the Transition Period:    

 (i) Ameritrade determines that it will terminate any Affected Employee to whom TD has a written or legal obligation of repatriation to Canada, Ameritrade agrees to negotiate in good faith with TD regarding the impact of any such termination, _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) (1) Ameritrade shall not be obligated to pay any severance to such Affected Employee who accepts employment in Canada with TD and (2) Ameritrade shall pay one-half of the reasonable costs associated with such repatriation (intended to primarily represent relocation expenses) and (B) (1) Ameritrade shall be obligated to pay any severance to such Affected Employee who will not be employed in Canada with TD and (2) TD shall pay one hundred percent of the reasonable costs associated with such repatriation (intended to primarily represent relocation expenses); and   

 (ii) Ameritrade terminates any Affected Employee during a quarterly or annual bonus period, Ameritrade agrees that, subject to Section 5.6(f), such Affected Employee shall be entitled to a pro rata bonus calculated by multiplying (A) the average of his or her bonus for the prior two quarterly or annual bonus periods (as applicable) times (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of days within the quarterly or annual bonus period, as applicable, that have elapsed prior to such Affected Employees date of termination, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such bonus period.   

 (c) Ameritrade shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give Affected Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual (except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under such employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Ameritrade or its Subsidiaries in which such Affected Employees participate for such Affected Employees service with Waterhouse or its Business Subsidiaries (or its predecessors) to the same extent recognized by Waterhouse or the Business Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. None of the provisions contained in this Section 5.6(c) shall operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Affected Employee.    

 (d) Ameritrade shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations with respect to the Affected Employees as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Ameritrade after the Closing Date, to the extent such Affected Employees were not subject to such preexisting condition, exclusion and waiting period under the comparable Waterhouse Benefit Plan as of the time immediately preceding the Closing, and (ii) provide each  ##### 

 

 

61    

Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans that such Affected Employees are
eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.    

 (e) Ameritrade shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, expressly assume or retain, all liabilities and obligations under or relating to the termination protection agreements set forth in Section 5.6(e) of the TD Disclosure Schedule and Ameritrade agrees to honor such termination protection agreements in accordance with their terms, subject to Section 5.6(g) hereof.    

 (f) In respect of the quarterly and annual bonuses payable to Affected Employees for service rendered in TDs fiscal years 2005 and 2006 (the " _Waterhouse 2005 and 2006 Bonus Program_ "), Ameritrade shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with this Section 5.6(f), continue to honor the terms and conditions of all obligations existing as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ameritrade, or its Subsidiaries, shall only be responsible to pay its proportional share of any quarterly and annual bonuses under the Waterhouse 2005 and 2006 Bonus Program determined following the Closing Date, based on the ratio of the number of days elapsed in the quarterly or annual bonus period, as applicable, after the Closing Date, to the total number of days in such quarterly or annual bonus period, as applicable. TD shall retain responsibility to pay its proportional share of all such quarterly and annual bonuses under the Waterhouse 2005 and 2006 Bonus Program, based on the ratio of the number of days elapsed in the quarterly or annual bonus period, as applicable, prior to and including the Closing Date to the total number of days in such quarterly or annual bonus period, as applicable. Ameritrade and TD shall each pay their respective proportional share of any such bonuses according to Waterhouses methodology and timing, upon termination of the Affected Employees employment or on the regularly scheduled bonus payment date(s), as applicable. In accordance with the terms of the Waterhouse 2005 and 2006 Bonus Program, any Affected Employee who is terminated for unsatisfactory job performance or misconduct or who voluntarily resigns from employment, whether prior to, upon or following the Closing Date, shall not be eligible to receive payment of his or her quarterly and/or annual bonus, as applicable.    

 (g) With respect to Affected Employees and former Waterhouse employees, TD will assume or retain all outstanding costs relating to equity under any TD or Waterhouse Benefit Plan, except for the unvested portion of restricted share unit awards as provided for in this Section 5.6(g). With respect to stock options, TD will retain and continue to expense the vested and currently unvested TD stock options and continue to administer such stock option plans at its expense. With respect to restricted share units (including performance restricted share units), TD will transfer the vested liability and offsetting hedge with respect to all such awards held by Affected Employees to Ameritrade at Closing, so that Ameritrade shall be responsible for the liability pertaining to the unvested portion of the outstanding awards to the extent provided in Section 5.6(g) of the TD Disclosure Schedule. TD will continue to administer the restricted share unit awards (including performance restricted share units) over the life of such awards at its expense. With respect to Waterhouse phantom stock options, (i) TD will assume the liability for payout in accordance with the terms of the relevant TD or Waterhouse Benefit Plan, and (ii) TD will continue to administer all such awards over the life of the awards and pay all associated costs for such administration.      ##### 

 

    

62    

 (h) As of the Closing Date, all Affected Employees shall be fully vested in their account balances in the Waterhouse 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (" _Waterhouse 401k Plan_ "). In the event that the Waterhouse 401k Plan is merged into the Ameritrade 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (" _Ameritrade 401k Plan_ "), Affected Employees who had not yet satisfied the eligibility requirements for participation in the Waterhouse 401k Plan immediately prior to such merger shall be eligible to participate in the Ameritrade 401k Plan on the first plan entry date following the merger after they have satisfied the eligibility requirements for participation in the Ameritrade 401k Plan.    

 (i) To the extent permissible under applicable law, Ameritrade shall take such actions as may be necessary to prevent the transactions contemplated under this Agreement from accelerating or increasing any amounts payable under, or otherwise providing any additional rights, any funding, or any additional benefits under, any Ameritrade Benefit Plan, and to the extent any employment agreement of an Ameritrade employee listed in Section 5.6(i) of the Ameritrade Disclosure Schedule would treat the transactions contemplated hereunder as a change of control, will use best efforts to negotiate and cause to be executed, to the fullest extent possible, individual amendments or waivers, as applicable, to such employment agreements prior to the Closing Date.    

 (j) Prior to the Closing Date, Ameritrade, in consultation with TD, may enter into new or amended employment agreements with the individuals listed in Section 5.6(j) of the TD Disclosure Schedule. The new or amended employment agreements shall contain such terms and conditions which are negotiated in good faith between the applicable individual and Ameritrade (in consultation with TD) prior to the Closing Date.    

 (k) TD shall not, and shall cause Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries not to, at any time within the ninety-day period prior to the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (" _WARN_ "), or any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation, affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of Waterhouse or the Business Subsidiaries, without notifying Ameritrade in advance and without complying with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN and any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation. Ameritrade shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, at any time beginning on the Closing Date and for a period of ninety calendar days thereafter, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN or any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation, with respect to the Affected Employees, without notifying TD in advance and without complying with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN and any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation.    

 (l) Ameritrade, in consultation with TD, may establish a special integration bonus program for the benefit of Affected Employees who continue to be employed by Ameritrade or who are employed for a specified employment term by Ameritrade following the Closing Date.    

 (m) Ameritrade may take such actions as it deems necessary to adjust all outstanding equity awards held by any Ameritrade employee or director in order to ensure that     ##### 

  

     

63    

all such equity awards maintain their intrinsic value, as determined prior to
the payment of the Special Dividend, to account for the payment, if any, of
any such Special Dividend.

 (p) Ameritrade shall pay TD the net present value up to the amount specified in Section 5.6(p) of the TD Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the retiree welfare benefit coverage promised to those individuals listed in Section 5.6(p) of the TD Disclosure Schedule. TD shall retain all other obligations of any kind relating to or arising with respect to any Benefit Plan of TD or Waterhouse Benefit Plan which provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide, retiree welfare benefit coverage to any Affected Employee, independent contractor or director for any reason, other than with respect to welfare benefit coverage provided in conjunction with severance during any period that severance is being paid and as required by COBRA. TD shall continue to administer all retiree welfare benefit plans at its expense.    

 (q) Prior to the Closing Date, Ameritrade shall take all such actions which are necessary to adopt amendments to the Ameritrade health care Benefit Plans and TD shall take all such actions which are necessary to adopt amendments to the Waterhouse health care Benefit Plans to provide that the definition of employee eligible to receive benefits under such plans shall include any employee who has been terminated and is receiving payments under a severance arrangement sponsored either by Ameritrade or Waterhouse, as applicable.

64    

 SECTION 5.8. _Financing and Other Actions for Special Dividend._ Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Ameritrade shall use all reasonable efforts to arrange for the Special Dividend Indebtedness pursuant to adequate and appropriate financing facilities and other debt funding sources to provide the cash necessary to pay that portion of the Special Dividend not funded by other Ameritrade available excess cash or the TD capital contribution contemplated by Section 5.23, in each case on terms reasonably acceptable to TD.

 (b) Ameritrade shall give prompt notice to TD of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Ameritrade to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in Article VI or give rise to any right of termination under Article VII unless the underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right.

after such credit or offset is applied against another Tax liability, as the
case may be.    

 (d) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be: (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i) of this paragraph (such as franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.    

 (e) If Ameritrade receives notice of an audit, claim, dispute or controversy relating to Taxes (a " _Tax Notice_ ") which TD is required to pay pursuant to this Agreement, then Ameritrade shall notify TD in writing of such Tax Notice within twenty (20) days of receiving such notice;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Ameritrades failure to provide such notice shall not release TD from any indemnification obligation hereunder unless TDs ability to contest such Tax is materially adversely affected as a result of such failure to notify. TD shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that TD may decline to participate in such Tax contest. If TD controls the conduct of such Tax contest, TD regularly shall advise Ameritrade of the status of such Tax contest and shall not resolve such Tax contest without Ameritrades written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. If TD declines to control such Tax contest, then Ameritrade shall, at TDs expense, have the right to control the conduct of such Tax contest; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Ameritrade shall regularly advise TD of the status of such Tax contest and shall not resolve such Tax contest without TDs written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. In the event of a dispute between TD and Ameritrade regarding the conduct or resolution of any Tax contest, such dispute shall be referred to a nationally recognized accounting or law firm mutually acceptable to TD and Ameritrade (the " _Tax Arbitrator_ "). The decision of the Tax Arbitrator shall be final and binding, and its fees and costs shall be shared equally by the disputing parties. Each party shall bear its own costs for participating in such dispute resolution.    

 (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all Transfer Taxes (i) arising from the Reorganization or (ii) imposed by a taxing authority of Canada in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (except with respect to the purchase by TD of the capital stock of Ameritrade Canada Inc., which shall be governed by the Ameritrade Canada Purchase Agreement) shall be paid by TD. All other Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid 50% by TD and 50% by Ameritrade. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.16(f), TD shall not be responsible for any payment with respect to Transfer Taxes if and to the extent an amount has been reflected, accrued or reserved for on Waterhouses Final Statement in respect of such Transfer Taxes. TD and Ameritrade shall cooperate in timely making all filings, Returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply     #####

taxes).

TD will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than Ameritrade with respect to any TD Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.18 shall apply to the Reorganization.    

 SECTION 5.19. _Waterhouse 2004 Audited Financials_. TD shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be prepared and delivered to Ameritrade, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in no event later than the 60th day following the date of this Agreement, the audited consolidated balance sheet, statement of income, statement of retained earnings and statement of cash flows for Waterhouse as of October 31, 2004.

 (b) In the event that prior to the Closing Date, TD and Ameritrade are unable to agree to the terms of such outsourcing arrangement, (i) TD Waterhouse Bank, N.A. and Waterhouse shall continue to provide Banking Services to each other in a manner and at service     ##### 

  

     

70    

levels consistent with past practice under the Original Services Agreement and
shall allocate costs with respect to such Banking Services ratably, based on
each partys respective portion of expenses attributable to the ongoing
provision of transaction processing services, personnel and other related
support service expenses by such party, and (ii) Waterhouse, Ameritrade, TD
Waterhouse Investor Services Inc. and TD Waterhouse Bank, N.A. shall continue
to negotiate in good faith with the goal of entering into a formal
outsourcing agreement as described in paragraph (a) above, unless such parties
otherwise mutually agree or until such time as the Original Services
Agreement would have otherwise terminated.    

 (c) TD and Ameritrade agree to commence good faith negotiations, promptly following the date of this Agreement, regarding (i) re-direction of Internet traffic from the TD address <tdwaterhouse.com> to either the address <tdameritrade.com> or another Internet address chosen by Ameritrade and (ii) TDs phase-out of its <tdwaterhouse.com> address, in each case to be effective as of the Closing Date or as promptly thereafter as practicable.

Without limiting the foregoing, during such 30-day period, TD shall continue to provide to Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries access to office space, equipment purchase and maintenance services, human resources services, banking services and telecommunications services in connection with the CCC as was provided in the ordinary course of business prior to the Closing. Except as set forth in Section 5.21(b)), TD shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the CCC (including, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.6 of the Master Services Agreement, with respect to any employees or contractors associated therewith).    

 (b) In consideration for the services set forth in Section 5.21(a), Ameritrade shall pay TD the expenses attributable to provision of such services consistent with the allocation set forth in the Master Services Agreement, but pro-rated solely for the thirty (30) day period after the Closing; provided, however, that such expenses shall not exceed the average monthly expenses allocated by TD for such services during the prior six month period prior to the Closing. In addition, Ameritrade shall reimburse TD for any costs actually incurred by TD resulting from termination and/or severance pay and the applicable employer portion of any payments required for the continuation of benefit coverage during the severance period and required by applicable law in connection with TDs termination of employees associated with the CCC ("CCC Employees"). TD shall use all reasonable efforts, consistent with the needs of TD      ##### 

  

     

71    

and its Subsidiaries, to reduce Ameritrades severance exposure with respect
to CCC Employees, such as, without limitation, offering such CCC Employees
employment in other call centers operated by TD in London, Ontario, Canada or
at other suitable positions at TD, if positions are available and suitable for
the applicable CCC Employee and by providing as much advance notice of
termination to CCC Employees as is practicable and seeking to maintain the
services of such CCC Employees during such advance notice period. During the
Transition Period, TD shall not without the consent of Ameritrade, with such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, hire
additional employees for the CCC, or modify or extend the employment
contracts or severance obligations of CCC Employees.    

 SECTION 5.22. _Ameritrade Bank_. Ameritrade shall withdraw any applications for permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations, consents, certificates, order or approvals relating to the formation of Ameritrade Bank and shall not take any action to qualify Ameritrade Bank or any other Affiliate of Ameritrade as an insured depository institution (as such term is defined in 12 U.S.C. § 1813(c)(2) or any successor provision). This covenant shall terminate upon the Closing, at which point the provisions of Section 5.4(c) of the Stockholders Agreement shall take effect.    

 SECTION 5.23. _Available Capital_. As of the record date with respect to the Special Dividend, provided that Ameritrade has provided TD with at least 10 Business Days prior notice with respect to such declaration) TD shall cause Waterhouse to be capitalized with cash in an amount at least equal to the product of $1.00 and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding as of a date that is within three Business Days of such record date, based on information provided to TD by Ameritrade and shall cause Waterhouse to maintain the amount of such contribution in cash until the Closing.    

 SECTION 5.24. _Accounting Adjustment_. Prior to Closing, TD shall cause the Business Subsidiaries to correct on their respective books and records the historical FAS 13 accounting with respect to rent holiday and schedule evaluation on operating leases of the Business Subsidiaries.

 SECTION 8.4. _Indemnification Procedures_.   

 (a) If an Indemnified Ameritrade Entity or an Indemnified TD Entity (each, an " _Indemnified Entity_ ") believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Article VIII (whether or not the amount of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim, suit, action or proceeding brought by a Person not a party to this Agreement or affiliated with any such party (a " _Third Party_ "), within ten Business Days following receipt of notice of such claim, suit, action or proceeding by such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a claim, suit, action or proceeding brought by a Third Party, within 30 days after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable detail, including the amount of the Damages relating thereto (if quantifiable), the event or occurrence giving rise thereto and the basis for such claim for indemnification.   

 (b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Entity under this Article VIII relates to an action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Party may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such action or claim or to defend such action or claim, in each case at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.4(b)) and with its own counsel. If, within 30 days of receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party action or claim, the Indemnifying Party (i) advises such Indemnified Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Party will not elect to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim or (ii) fails to make such an election in writing, such Indemnified Entity may (subject to the Indemnifying Partys continuing right of election in the preceding sentence), at its option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim; _provided_ that any such settlement or   ##### 

 

 

82  

compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party makes an election in
accordance with this Section 8.4(b) to defend, settle or compromise such
action, all of the Indemnified Entitys reasonable costs and expenses
arising out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or
claim shall be Damages subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent
provided herein. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party all information reasonably available to such Indemnified
Entity relating to such action or claim. In addition, the parties shall
render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such action or claim. The
party in charge of the defense shall keep the other parties fully apprised at
all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with
respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend any such action
or claim, then the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in
such defense with counsel, at such Indemnified Entitys sole cost and expense
(unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict between the positions of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Entity that would preclude or render inadvisable joint
representation of such parties, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses hereunder with respect to one law firm, in
addition to local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, to represent the
Indemnified Entity). In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or compromise) any action or
claim as described above, the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse
the Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense (or negotiation,
settlement or compromise) to the extent that such costs and expenses do not
exceed the amount of the remaining Threshold (with any such costs and expenses
being counted toward the Threshold). In each case in which the Indemnifying
Party has elected to assume the defense of any action or claim pursuant to
this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnifying Party may not settle or compromise such
action or claim without the consent of the Indemnified Entities,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that under no circumstances will an Indemnified
Entity be required to consent to any settlement or compromise (i) that does
not include as a term thereof the release by the plaintiff or claimant of the
Indemnified Entity from all liability with respect to such claim or action,
other than amounts paid by the Indemnifying Party; or (ii) that imposes on the
Indemnified Entity any equitable remedies or other non-monetary relief that
could affect the Indemnified Entitys business or operations.    

 (c) In the event of any conflict between this Section 8.4 and Section 5.16 with respect to claims relating to Taxes, Section 5.16 shall govern.   

 SECTION 8.5. _General_.   

 (a) Each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article VIII to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such Indemnified Entity with regard to the applicable claims and to recover any amounts to which it may be entitled in respect of the applicable claims pursuant to contractual or other indemnification rights that any of the Indemnified Parties may have against Third Parties. The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds, tax benefits actually realized or other amounts actually   ##### 

 

 

83  

recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity in reduction of the
related Damages. If an Indemnified Entity shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages
and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds, tax benefits or other
amounts in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnified Entity shall
promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such
insurance proceeds, tax benefits actually realized or other amounts actually
received.    

 (b) In addition to the requirements of Section 8.5(a), each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article VIII to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages.   

 (c) The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of action which the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.   

 (d) The indemnification provided in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party hereto with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this Section 8.5(d) shall not apply or limit the remedy available to either party hereto with respect to any fraudulent act or willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement by the other party hereto.   

 (e) The parties agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Exchange Consideration, unless otherwise required by applicable law.   

 (f) All indemnity payments under this Agreement shall be payable in United States dollars. If any indemnification claims are incurred in a currency other than United States dollars, then such amount denominated in such foreign currency shall be converted into an amount denominated in United States dollars using the noon buying rate for such foreign currency as certified by the New York Federal Reserve Bank on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such payment is paid.   

 (g) All claims for indemnification made by any party under this Agreement shall be without duplication of any corresponding claim for indemnification made by such party under the Ameritrade Canada Purchase Agreement, and _vice versa_.

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, the defense of sovereign immunity, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason, other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 9.2, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any Litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   #####

 (b) Each of Ameritrade and TD irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such Litigation by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail.   

 (c) TD and Ameritrade each expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waivers are intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America; provided that consent by Ameritrade and TD to jurisdiction and service contained in this Section 9.2 is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 9.2 and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.   

 SECTION 9.3. _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part (by operation of law or otherwise), by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that TD may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Subsidiaries (other than Waterhouse and any of the Business Subsidiaries) without the prior consent of Ameritrade, but no such assignment shall relieve TD of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 9.4. _Interpretation_. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement all references to "dollars" or "$" are to United States dollars. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require Ameritrade, TD or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation.   

 SECTION 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in separate counterparts each of which shall be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

 SECTION 9.6. _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules and Disclosure Schedules hereto) and the Transaction Agreements, together with the several agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed hereto or thereto, embody the complete agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof   ##### 

 

 

90  

and supersede and preempt any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, that may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.    

 SECTION 9.7. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.   

 SECTION 9.8. _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   

 SECTION 9.9. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (upon telephonic confirmation of receipt), on the first Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered by a recognized next day courier service, or on the third Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. All notices hereunder shall be delivered as set forth below, or pursuant to such other instructions as may be designated in writing by the party to receive such notice.
