<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4.26.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Labor and Employment Matters</U>. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union agreements to which Ameritrade or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound. To the knowledge of
Ameritrade, since June&nbsp;1, 2002, neither Ameritrade nor any of its Subsidiaries has encountered any
labor union organizing activity or had any actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages,
slowdowns or lockouts, other than any such events that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ameritrade. Except with respect to
instances that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Ameritrade, Ameritrade and each of its Subsidiaries (a)&nbsp;is, and since
June&nbsp;1, 2002, has been in, compliance with all applicable laws relating to employment and
employment practices, occupational safety and health standards, terms and conditions of employment
and wages and hours, and (b)&nbsp;is not, and since June&nbsp;1, 2002, has not, engaged in any unfair labor
practice. During the two years preceding the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in
Section&nbsp;4.26 of the Ameritrade Disclosure Schedule, Ameritrade has not received written notice of
any unfair labor practice charge against Ameritrade or any of its Subsidiaries which charge remains
pending.

contemplated by the Reorganization or as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or as set
forth in Section&nbsp;5.1 of the TD Disclosure Schedule or to the extent that Ameritrade shall otherwise
consent in writing, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), TD

businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as heretofore
conducted and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, (ii)&nbsp;pay its debts and Taxes
when due and pay or perform other material obligations when due and (iii)&nbsp;use all reasonable
efforts to preserve intact the present business organizations of Waterhouse and the Business
Subsidiaries, maintain the rights and franchises of, and preserve the relationships with customers,
suppliers and others having business dealings with, Waterhouse and the Business Subsidiaries to the

own only one seat on the New York Stock Exchange, TD shall not permit Waterhouse or any of the

a violation of Section&nbsp;1.3(f)(i) hereof, and (B)&nbsp;dividends paid to TD by Waterhouse to the extent
it reasonably estimates that Waterhouse&#146;s Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value will exceed its
Targeted Closing Date Net Tangible Book Value (provided that no such dividend shall affect TD&#146;s

lawful action to call and give notice of, and shall use all reasonable efforts to convene and hold,
a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement for the
purpose of obtaining the Ameritrade Required Votes and any Additional Votes, and, subject to
Section&nbsp;5.3(c), shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit the approval of the Ameritrade Stock
Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals by such stockholders.
Ameritrade shall not fix, announce or change the record date for such meeting of its stockholders
without TD&#146;s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Board of
Directors of Ameritrade shall recommend approval by such stockholders of the Ameritrade Stock
Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals (the &#147;<U><B>Ameritrade
Recommendation</B></U>&#148;), shall cause the Ameritrade Recommendation to be included in the Proxy
Statement, and shall not (nor shall any committee thereof) publicly withdraw, modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to TD such recommendation (any such withdrawal, modification or qualification, a
&#147;<U><B>Change in Ameritrade Recommendation</B></U>&#148;), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by
Section&nbsp;5.3(c). Notwithstanding any Change in Ameritrade Recommendation, unless this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article&nbsp;VII, the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated Charter
and any Additional Proposals shall be submitted to the stockholders of Ameritrade at the Ameritrade
Stockholders&#146; Meeting for the purpose of approving the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade
Restated Charter and any Additional Proposals, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to relieve Ameritrade of such obligation, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article&nbsp;VII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Ameritrade may
adjourn or postpone the Ameritrade Stockholders&#146; Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the SEC Proxy Statement required by law is provided to its
stockholders in advance of a vote on the Ameritrade Stock Issuance, the Ameritrade Restated
Charter and any Additional Proposals or if as of the time for which the Ameritrade Stockholders&#146;
Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Ameritrade
Stockholders&#146; Meeting or there are insufficient affirmative votes to obtain the Ameritrade Required
Votes and any Additional Votes. In addition to the foregoing, Ameritrade shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article&nbsp;VII.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;In addition to the proposals to approve the Ameritrade Stock Issuance and the Ameritrade
Restated Charter, Ameritrade shall submit to its stockholders for a vote at the Ameritrade
Stockholders&#146; Meeting, shall include in the SEC Proxy Statement and, subject to Section&nbsp;5.3(c),
shall use all reasonable efforts in compliance with applicable law to solicit the approval of its
stockholders of, such other matters related to this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as TD may reasonably request, consistent with this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and subject to the consent of Ameritrade, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (collectively, the &#147;<U><B>Additional
Proposals</B></U>&#148;). Unless otherwise required by law or the bylaws of Ameritrade or mutually agreed
by TD and Ameritrade, the vote required to approve any Additional Proposals shall be the

any director, officer, employee, agent or Representative of Ameritrade or its Subsidiaries, at the
direction or with the consent of Ameritrade or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section&nbsp;5.4 by Ameritrade. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that
participation by Ameritrade and its duly authorized directors, officers, employees, agents or
Representatives in negotiations and discussions in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a)
of this Section&nbsp;5.4 with respect to an Acquisition Proposal following the receipt thereof shall not
be deemed to constitute the solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal if such initial receipt was not
initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of this Section&nbsp;5.4, and
notwithstanding any changes to such Acquisition Proposal that may result from such discussions or
negotiations.

cause to be taken, all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may
be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by this

authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Authority and any other
third party which is required to be obtained or made by TD, Ameritrade or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Ameritrade and/or TD, as
applicable, shall, as soon as practicable, make any initial filings required under the HSR Act and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">made pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.5, each
party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Authority such amendment or supplement. In addition, Ameritrade and TD shall, to the
extent permitted by law and the applicable Governmental Authority and except as otherwise provided
in the last sentence of Section&nbsp;5.5(a), permit the other party to review in advance any
communication intended to be given by it to, and consult with the other party in advance of any
meeting or conference with, a Governmental Authority or any other Person in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the Competition Act (Canada), and any other federal,

restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, &#147;<U><B>Antitrust Laws</B></U>&#148;). Each of Ameritrade and TD shall use all reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act, apply for an Advance
Ruling Certificate or no-action letter from the Commissioner of Competition (Canada), and comply
with other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement. Ameritrade and TD shall use all
reasonable efforts to take any and all of the following actions to the extent necessary to obtain
the approval of any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable
laws regarding the transactions contemplated hereby: (i)&nbsp;entering into negotiations, (ii)&nbsp;providing
information required by law or governmental regulation, and (iii)&nbsp;complying with any &#147;second
request&#148; for information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws.

provided in this Section&nbsp;5.5(d)), neither Ameritrade nor TD shall be under any obligation to make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for a Divestiture.

(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any material assets or categories of assets
of Ameritrade or Waterhouse or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, (B)&nbsp;the
imposition of any material limitation or restriction on the ability of Ameritrade or Waterhouse or
any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to freely conduct their business or own such
assets, or (C)&nbsp;the holding separate of the shares of Waterhouse Common Stock or any limitation or
regulation on the ability of Ameritrade or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Waterhouse Common Stock. In the event that the Commissioner of Competition applies, threatens in writing to apply, or advises TD or Ameritrade
that it proposes to apply to the Competition Tribunal (Canada) for an order (including an
injunction) with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, TD and Ameritrade
shall negotiate in good faith with each other, and confer with the Commissioner of Competition, to
arrange for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement subject to the
holding separate of Ameritrade Canada, Inc. by the parties following the Closing (and prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Ameritrade Canada Purchase Agreement). If the
parties are unable to reach agreement with the Commissioner of Competition regarding such a hold
separate transaction, then Ameritrade shall effect a sale or other disposition of Ameritrade
Canada, Inc. prior to the Closing on commercially reasonable terms.

assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a &#147;<U><B>Claim Notice</B></U>&#148;) to
the party from which indemnification is sought (the &#147;<U><B>Indemnifying Party</B></U>&#148;) (i)&nbsp;if the event

giving rise to such claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a claim, suit, action

Party may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such action or claim or to
defend such action or claim, in each case at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last

not elect to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim or (ii)&nbsp;fails to make such an

Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Unless and until

or compromise such action, all of the Indemnified Entity&#146;s reasonable costs and expenses arising
out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or claim shall be Damages subject

available to the Indemnifying Party all information reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity
relating to such action or claim. In addition, the parties shall render to each other such
assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any
such action or claim. The party in charge of the defense shall keep the other parties fully
apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect
thereto. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend any such action or claim, then the Indemnified
Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel, at such Indemnified Entity&#146;s
sole cost and expense (unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict between the positions of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Entity that would
preclude or render inadvisable joint representation of such parties, in which case the Indemnifying

Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with
such defense (or negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent that such costs and expenses
do not exceed the amount of the remaining Threshold (with any such costs and expenses being counted

defense of any action or claim pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.4(b), the Indemnifying Party may not
settle or compromise such action or claim without the consent of the Indemnified Entities, which

action, other than amounts paid by the Indemnifying Party; or (ii)&nbsp;that imposes on the Indemnified

any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the Litigation

shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or

unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all

determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and
