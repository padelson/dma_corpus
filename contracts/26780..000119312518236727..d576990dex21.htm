   3. |

Actions Prior to Closing 

---|--- 
 



   3.1 |

General 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

Unless specifically otherwise provided herein, the Parties undertake to use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to procure that: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

the conditions precedent set forth in Article 4.2 be satisfied on or by the
Closing Date; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

all their Affiliates do all acts and things as are reasonably necessary (and
within their power) to implement the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The Parties shall cooperate and inform each other of any relevant actions
taken prior to Closing. 

---|---|--- 
 



   3.2 |

Filings and Submissions 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Buyer shall (and the Seller
shall, in jurisdictions where the Seller is required to make a separate
filing), at its own cost, ensure that any filings to the competent merger
control authorities required pursuant to Article 4.2.1(b) will be made timely
(and within 15 (fifteen) Business Days after the date of this Agreement with
respect to any required filings under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act), under
applicable laws and regulations, and without undue delay after the signing of
this Agreement. Such filings shall be made by the Buyer on its own behalf or
on behalf of the Parties in jurisdictions where permitted by the applicable
laws and regulations, or jointly or separately by the Buyer and the Seller
where required. The Buyer shall give the Seller a reasonable opportunity to
review and provide comments on such filings in advance, and the Buyer shall
consider in good faith the views of the Seller; provided, for the avoidance of
doubt, that no delay by the Buyer in making any filing or submission caused by
the Sellers review of such filing or submission, or the Sellers failure to
provide consent timely, pursuant hereto shall constitute a breach by the Buyer
of its obligations pursuant to this Article. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

The Buyer shall have primary responsibility for obtaining all consents,
approvals or actions which are required to satisfy the condition precedent to
Closing set forth in Article 4.2.1(b) and shall take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary for that purpose. The Seller and the Buyer shall
closely cooperate in the preparation of such merger control filings and in
additional submissions and other efforts to obtain all required consents,
approvals and actions to satisfy such condition. The Parties and their
Affiliates shall make available to each other all resources, including
promptly providing access to internal documents and 

---|---|---   10  | 45



      |

 information and other reasonable assistance, subject to appropriate clean
team and confidentiality arrangements, including making available any
employees or advisors, to facilitate the swift preparation of all necessary
filings or submissions to merger control authorities. The Buyer and the Seller
shall each promptly notify the other (and provide copies, or in the case of
non-written communication, details) of any correspondence with the merger
control authorities and provide copies of any written statement, order or
decision of such authorities. Each Party shall supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested by
any merger control authority and shall as promptly as practicable make
available any employees or advisors if required in connection with any filings
with, or requests from, any merger control authority. The Parties shall keep
each other informed of any discussions and negotiations with the competent
merger control authorities with the objective to promptly obtain clearance for
the Transaction no later than the Long Stop Date. The Buyer may waive filings
with the competent authorities or agree with such authorities on the extension
of any examination period only with the express prior written consent of
Seller which shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. 

---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information exchanged under
this Article 3.2. The Parties hereto agree to treat information protected from

defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Article 3.2 in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

     | (a) |

No later than 5 (five) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall deliver to the Buyer written confirmation of the Short Term Financing
Facilities Debt Amounts. The Seller guarantees that no transaction involving a
Segment Company occurs through the Short Term Financing Facilities after this
date. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

If the assignment of the Entrusted Loan to the Buyer (or to one of its
Affiliates) is legally not permissible, the Seller and the Buyer shall
implement a permissible solution which is economically identical to the one
provided for in this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



   3.4 |

Closing Memorandum 

---|---

Seller or one of its Affiliates is the parent, the Seller shall have the right
(but not the obligation) to defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel,
such claim. The Seller shall procure that no such claim is settled without
the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Buyer shall cooperate with, and provide
at its own cost appropriate documentation (subject to any statutory privilege
or statutory duties of confidentiality) and support as reasonably requested
by the Seller or the Sellers counsel in connection with such compromise or
defense. The Buyer shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in
the defense of any asserted liability.

shall at any time have the right to settle or direct the settlement of a Tax
claim by the Buyer, if the Seller unconditionally agrees to indemnify the
Buyer for any Damage caused by such settlement, unless Buyer prefers to
compromise such Tax liability pursuant to and in accordance with
Article 6.1.5(c). 

---|---|--- 



   6.1.6 |

No double counting 

---|--- 
 

If the same fact, matter, event or circumstance gives rise to more than one
claim for breach of a representation or warranty by the Seller, the Buyer
shall not be entitled to recover more than once the amount of the same Damage
arising in connection with such fact, matter, event or circumstance. For the
avoidance of doubt, this provision does not restrict the Buyers right to
fully recover in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, even if another
person may have a claim against the Seller to recover damages arising in
connection with the same fact, matter, event or circumstance.

 



   6.2 |

Remedies of the Seller

The provisions of Article 6.1 shall apply by analogy with respect to any

    6.3 |

Remedies Exclusive 

---|--- 
 

The remedies in this Article 6 and in Article 4.2.4 shall be in lieu of, and
not in addition to, the remedies provided for under statutory law. All other
remedies including, without limitation, the right to rescind this Agreement
shall not apply and shall be expressly waived. In particular, and without
limitation to the foregoing, the Parties hereby explicitly waive the rights
under articles 192 _et seq_. and 197 _et seq_. CO and any other rights of a
similar nature and the right of contract rescission under articles 23 _et
seq._ and 205 CO. For the avoidance of doubt, this Article 6.3 does
not exclude articles 28 CO and 199 CO.



   6.4 |

Remedy Payments as Adjustment to Purchase Price

The Parties agree to treat all payments made after the Closing under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the payments made under this

is incurred) as a result of, arising from or based upon the Reorganization,
and, if and to the extent, a Tax Authority in a final Tax assessment
attributes such an indemnification payment to a Segment Company despite that
in accordance with Article 6.4 all payments after the Closing under this

amount of Taxes that results as consequence of such an attribution.



   8. |

Environment

The Seller has provided the Buyer with phase 1 environmental reports with

Environmental Contamination Fairly Disclosed to Buyer at any Site (Remedial
Actions), the Seller shall be required to indemnify and hold the Buyer and
the Segment Companies harmless for such Remedial Actions if and to the extent
(i) the Remedial Actions are required by the Environmental Laws as applicable
on the Closing Date, (ii) no or an insufficient related provision, reserve or
valuation allowance has been included in the Financial Statements as at
December 31, 2017, and (iii) the competent authorities have given enforceable
orders regarding the Remedial Actions, provided that (y) the Buyer is
permitted to inform the competent authority, and (z) such competent authority
engages in giving enforceable orders regarding remedial actions under the
applicable Environmental Laws (such Remedial Actions referred to as being the
Covered Remedial Actions). In the event such competent authority does not
issue such enforceable orders, the preceding sub-paragraph (iii) is not

---|---|---

The following procedures shall apply to Covered Remedial Actions: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

the Covered Remedial Actions shall (1) establish legal compliance under
Environmental Laws applicable in the respective jurisdiction and (2) be cost
effective as 

---|---|---   26  | 45



      |

 compared to other available options, provided the cost effective option does
not interfere with the operations conducted at the relevant Site or materially
decrease the value of such Site;  

---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including the
Segment Companies) to, consult with one another in good faith and generally
conduct themselves in a commercially reasonable manner and in particular
comply with the following: 

---|---|--- 



     | (1) |

any Covered Remedial Action shall be commenced according to an action plan
established by the Buyer (the Remedial Action Plan);

     | (2) |

the Buyer shall give the Seller reasonable opportunity, by giving reasonable
prior written notice, to attend and participate in any material meetings or

Remedial Actions; 

---|---|--- 



     | (3) |

the Buyer shall provide the Seller with all material reports, correspondence,
analytical results and other relevant documentation with respect to the
Covered Remedial Actions; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (4) |

the Buyer shall provide the Seller a reasonable opportunity of at least 10
(ten) Business Days to review and reasonably comment on drafts of any
Remedial Action Plan or other material submission to governmental authorities
or third parties with respect to the Covered Remedial Actions. The Buyer shall

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Without prejudice to the generality of Article 6.1.4(f), the Seller shall not
be liable for any losses in connection with Environmental Contamination known
at the date hereof to the extent the losses are increased by: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

more stringent standards under the Environmental Laws applicable in the
relevant jurisdictions which are imposed as a result of (x) a use of any Site
for any purpose other than as at Closing or (y) construction on any Site; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

any intrusive sampling, clean-up, remediation or similar action of the Buyer
on the Site (unless required by law or an enforceable order), or construction
or change of use. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers liability under this Article 8.2 shall
only cover direct costs and expenses of the Remedial Actions incurred in
connection with the Environmental Contamination Fairly Disclosed to Buyer at
any Site, excluding any indirect or consequential costs, expenses or damages

---|---|---   27  | 45



    8.3 |

Leakage 

---|--- 



   8.3.1 |

Indemnity 

---|--- 
 

Subject to Permitted Leakage, the Seller hereby guarantees to the Buyer that
no Leakage has occurred or will occur between the Locked Box Date and the
Closing Date. The Seller shall be required to irrespective of any fault (
_verschuldensunabh_ _a_ _ngig_ ) indemnify and hold the Buyer and the Segment
Companies harmless from and against any Damage incurred by the Buyer or any
of the Segment Companies in connection with or as a result of any Leakage.



   8.3.2 |

Determination within the context of subclause (f) of the "Permitted Leakage"
definition  

---|--- 



     | (a) |

No later than 15 (fifteen) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the intragroup agreements or purchase
orders for services and products referred to in sub-clause (f) of the
"Permitted Leakage" definition which have not yet been Fairly Disclosed in the
Disclosure Information as of the date of this Agreement (the Additional
Intragroup Agreements) including a statement of the amount of Leakage between
the Locked Box Date and the above referenced reporting date in connection with
the Additional Intragroup Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, if, as a
part of the delivery of the Additional Intragroup Agreements, agreements which
have already been Fairly Disclosed in the Disclosure Information as of the
date of this Agreement are delivered to Buyer, such agreements do not
constitute Additional Intragroup Agreements for the purpose hereof. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The payments under the Additional Intragroup Agreements shall be deemed agreed
by the Parties for the purposes of subclause (f) of the "Permitted Leakage"
definition, unless Buyer gives notice to Seller within 20 (twenty) Business
Days following the Closing that it disagrees with any payment made under any
Additional Intragroup Agreements (such notice, the Notice of Objection),
stating in such notice in reasonable detail the reasons for its objections. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Seller and Buyer shall endeavor to resolve in good faith any objection of
Buyer within 10 (ten) Business Days after Sellers receipt of Buyers Notice
of Objection. If the Parties are unable to do so, 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

either Party may submit such disagreement for final and binding resolution to
(x) one of the big four accounting firms (i.e., EY, KPMG, PwC and Deloitte)
which is independent from both Parties, which shall select an experienced
partner for this matter, or (y) if the chosen accounting firm is for any
reason not in a position to serve as an expert, to another of the big four
accounting firms, which shall select an experienced partner, or (z) if this
second accounting firm is for any reason not in a position to serve as an
expert, a partner of an accounting firm to be agreed upon by the Parties, or,
if the Parties cannot agree on a partner of an accounting firm within 20
(twenty) Business Days of the failure to appoint an expert according to
Article 8.3.2(c)(i), an expert appointed by the Zurich Chamber of Commerce
upon request by either Buyer or Seller (the expert appointed in accordance
with this Article 8.3.2(c)(i), the Appraiser). 

---|---|---   28  | 45



      | (ii) |

The Appraiser shall establish independently, on behalf of both Parties and on
the terms set forth in this Article 8.3.2, whether the payments subject to
the Notice of Objection meet the criteria "made in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with past practices as required under written arms
length agreements" set forth in sub-clause (f) of the "Permitted Leakage"
definition. In so doing, the Appraiser shall serve as an expert (
_Schiedsgutachter_ ) in the sense of article 189 of the Swiss Civil Procedure
Code (ZPO, SR 272), and not as an arbitrator, and his determination of any
subject matter falling within the scope of his mandate shall be final and
binding on the Parties, provided that, in the event of a manifest error on the
part of the Appraiser, the relevant part of his determination shall be void
and the matter be remitted to him for correction. The Appraiser shall to the
extent necessary retain legal counsel of its choosing (excluding law firms
that advised Seller or Buyer in connection with this Agreement) to clarify
any legal considerations required in connection with the above appraisal. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

The Parties shall procure that the Appraiser will be furnished with all
documents and information relating to the Additional Intragroup Agreements as
the Appraiser may request. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

The Appraiser shall determine only whether the payments under the Additional
Intragroup Agreements that are disputed by Buyer in its Notice of Objection
are in line with the criteria "made in the ordinary course of business in
accordance with past practices as required under written arms length
agreements" set forth in sub-paragraph (f) of the "Permitted Leakage"
definition, and if not, what adjustments are to be made to these payments in
order to correct such inaccuracies. If the amount of Leakage in connection
with the Additional Intragroup Agreements exceeds the Disclosure Cap I
regarding Additional Intragroup Purchase Agreements and/or the Disclosure Cap
II regarding Additional Intragroup Non-Purchase Agreements, the Seller shall
reimburse to Buyer the higher of (i) the total amount of such excess, or (ii)
the amount determined by the Appraiser under this Article 8.3.2(c). Otherwise,
the Seller shall reimburse to the Buyer the amount determined by the
Appraiser under this Article 8.3.2(c) within 10 (ten) Business Days after the
Appraiser has provided the determination to the Parties in writing. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) |

The Appraiser shall make his determination pursuant to Article 8.3.2(c)(iv) as
soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 20 (twenty) Business Days
from the date of his or her appointment. 

---|---|--- 



     | (vi) |

The procedure as determined by the Appraiser shall be conducted in English and
shall comply with the requirements of due process; in particular, the
Appraiser shall: 

---|---|--- 



     | (1) |

give the Parties a reasonable opportunity to make written and oral
presentations to him or her; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) |

require that each Party provide the other with a copy of any written
presentations at the same time as they are made available to the Appraiser;
and 

---|---|---   29  | 45



      | (3) |

permit each Party to be present while oral submissions are being made by the
other Party or while evidence is gathered by the Appraiser, including
meetings and discussions with employees of the Company. 

---|---|--- 



     | (vii) |

Each Party and the Appraiser shall, and shall procure that its accountants and
assistants shall keep all information and documents provided to them pursuant
to this Article 8.3.2 confidential and shall not use the same for any other
purpose, except for disclosure or use in connection with the proceedings
before the Appraiser or otherwise in connection with its determination. 

---|---|--- 



     | (viii) |

The fees and expenses (including VAT) of the Appraiser and any legal advisor
retained by the expert shall be borne in equal proportions by Seller on the
one hand and Buyer on the other hand. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
proceedings pursuant to this Article 8.3.2, including the outcome thereof,
are not a condition to Closing of either Party and, therefore, cannot uphold
the Closing for any reason. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 8.3.2, either Party
may refer the matter to arbitration for final resolution pursuant to Article
13.2 at any time before the Parties and the Appraiser have reached agreement
on the terms of the Appraisers engagement. 

---|---|--- 
 



   8.4 |

Indemnification Procedure and Term of Indemnification 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Unless stated otherwise herein, the Parties agree that the indemnities under
Article 7.4 and Article 8 are independent indemnities and not limited by
Article 6, in particular not by the Qualifying Claim, the Threshold and the
Cap; provided, however, that Article 6.1.5 shall apply mutatis mutandis unless
provided otherwise herein, and that Article 6.1.6 shall also apply, mutatis
mutandis. In respect of Article 7.4, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees, that
in respect of the Indian Segment Companies, in Sellers assessment, based on
professional advice received, no taxation event should have occurred in India
as a consequence of the indirect transfers of the shares in the Indian Segment
Companies in the Reorganization, and therefore no notification requirements
are triggered by the indirect share transfers, and (i) the Buyer and the
Seller each acknowledge and agree that the Seller will promptly file a Tax
ruling request in respect of such indirect share transfers with the competent
Indian Tax Authorities requesting them to confirm that the indirect share
transfers are not taxable in India, and (ii) the Buyer will not, and will
undertake that from and after the date of the Closing the Indian Segment
Companies will not, file any notification in respect of the Indian Segment
Companies without Sellers prior written consent, without Seller having any
obligation to consent to such a notification; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this sentence will prevent or restrict Buyer or the Indian
Segment Companies from complying with mandatory applicable laws.  

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

If the Buyer has obtained knowledge of a matter or circumstance that could
give rise to a claim for indemnification under Article 7.4 or Article 8, it
shall give notice thereof to the 

---|---|---   30  | 45



      |

 Seller indicating the nature of such claim and the basis therefore in
accordance with Article 6.1.2(a), which shall apply mutatis mutandis. In case
of failure to give notice to the other Party pursuant to the preceding
sentence, Article 6.1.2(b) shall apply accordingly. 

---|--- 



     | (c) |

Any action, claim or set-off for losses subject to indemnification under
Article 7.4 or Article 8.1 shall be time-barred ( _verj_ _a_ _hrt_ ) unless a
respective notice is delivered as of 10 (ten) Business Days after the earlier
of (i) 6 (six) months after the assessment for the relevant Taxes has been
determined and becomes legally binding without the possibility to reopen the
tax assessment, or (ii) 6 (six) months after the date on which the applicable
statute of limitations for the relevant Taxes has expired. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

All claims of Buyer under Article 8.2 shall be time-barred ( _verj_ _a_ _hrt_
) upon the expiration of 7 (seven) years after the Closing Date. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

All claims of Buyer under Article 8.3 shall be time-barred ( _verj ahrt_) upon
the expiration of 18 (eighteen) months after the Closing Date. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties shall
promptly advise one another of the existence of any Tax audit (or the
announcement of any Tax audit), controversy or litigation by the Tax
authorities in any jurisdiction relating to Indemnifiable Tax or any price
allocations under this Agreement, and Seller shall have the right to join any
meetings with Tax authorities, and the Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, and the Buyer and Seller shall
retain and, upon the other Partys request, furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other Party, as promptly as practicable, such information
