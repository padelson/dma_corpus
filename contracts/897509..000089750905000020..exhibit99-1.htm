 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 

  **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of May 26, 2005, by and between First Capital Bancorp, Inc.
("FCB"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Georgia, with its principal office located in Norcross, Georgia, and Flag
Financial Corporation ("Flag"), a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Georgia, with its principal office located in
Atlanta, Georgia.

 

 

 **Preamble**

 

 The Boards of Directors of FCB and Flag are of the opinion that the
transaction described herein is in the best interest of the parties and their
respective shareholders. This Agreement provides for the merger of FCB with
and into Flag (the "Merger"). At the effective time of the Merger, and
subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein (including
the limitation on the number of shares of Flag Common Stock to be issued to
any shareholder of FCB), the outstanding shares of the capital stock of FCB
shall be converted into the right to receive shares of the common stock of
Flag. As a result, some or all of the FCB shareholders shall become
shareholders of Flag. The transaction described in this Agreement is subject
to the approvals of the shareholders of FCB, the shareholders of Flag, the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Department of
Banking and Finance of the State of Georgia, and the satisfaction of certain
other conditions described in this Agreement. It is the intention of the
parties to this Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax purposes
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code.

 

 Promptly following the Closing of the Merger, First Capital Bank, a wholly
owned subsidiary of FCB, shall be merged with and into Flag Bank under the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Flag Bank (the "Bank Mergers"). Each
of the other FCB Subsidiaries will remain in existence under its respective
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or other governing documents, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as wholly owned subsidiaries of
Flag.

 

 As an inducement to Flag to enter into this Agreement, each of the
executive officers and directors of each Party have executed and delivered to
the other Party a Support Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit A, H.N. Padget, Jr. and Flag have entered into an Employment
Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and William
R. Blanton and Flag have entered into a Non-Competition and Consulting
Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.

 

 Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1 of
this Agreement.

 

  **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 

 

 **ARTICLE 1**

 1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, FCB shall be merged with and into Flag in accordance with
the provisions of Section 14-2-1101 of the GBCC and with the effect provided
in Section 14-2-1106 of the GBCC. Flag shall be the Surviving Corporation
resulting from the Merger and the separate existence of FCB shall cease. The
Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which
has been approved and adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of FCB
and Flag.

 

 1.2 _Time and Place of Closing_. The Closing will take place at 9:30
a.m. on the date that the Effective Time occurs (or the immediately preceding
day if the Effective Time is earlier than 9:30 a.m.), or at such other time
as the Parties, acting through their Chief Executive Officers, may mutually
agree. The place of Closing shall be at the offices of Troutman Sanders LLP,
Atlanta, Georgia, or such other place as may be mutually agreed upon by the
Parties.

 

 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger contemplated by this Agreement shall
become effective on the date and at the time the Articles of Merger
reflecting the Merger shall become effective with the Secretary of State of
the State of Georgia. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless
otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the Chief Executive Officers of
each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the
Effective Time to occur on the last business day of the month in which occurs
the last to occur of (i) the effective date (including expiration of any
applicable waiting period) of the last required Consent of any
Regulatory Authority having authority over and approving or exempting the
Merger, (ii) the date on which the shareholders of FCB approve this
Agreement, (iii) the date on which the shareholders of Flag approve this
Agreement, or (iv) such later date as may be mutually agreed upon in writing
by the Chief Executive Officer of each Party.

 

 1.4 _Execution of Support Agreements_. Immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement and as a condition hereto, each of the executive
officers and directors of each Party is executing and delivering to the other
Party a Support Agreement in substantially the form as attached hereto as
Exhibit A.

 

 1.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest Flag with the full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
either or both of the Parties, or to effect the assignment to Flag of any and
all of FCB's Intellectual Property, the officers and directors of Flag are
fully authorized in the name of either or both of the Parties or otherwise to
take all such action.

 

 

 ****

 

 **ARTICLE 2**

  **TERMS OF MERGER**

 

 2.1 _Articles of Incorporation_. The Articles of Incorporation of Flag
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended or
repealed.

 



 2.2 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Flag in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
otherwise amended or repealed.

 

 2.3 _Directors_. The directors of Flag in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall serve as the directors of Flag from and after the
Effective Time, provided, that at the Effective Time, three directors (the
"Appointed Directors") who are serving as members of the Board of Directors
of FCB immediately prior to the Effective Time, one of whom shall be H.N.
Padget, Jr., shall be identified by FCB to Flag and, subject to the approval
by Flag elected as directors of Flag by the Flag Board of Directors;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, other than Mr. Padget, none of the Appointed
Directors may be a management director of FCB immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Appointed Directors will be divided among the three
classes of Flag's Board of Directors. In the event any of the Appointed
Directors shall not serve his or her full term prior to the next annual
meeting of Flag shareholders held after the Effective Time of the Merger, the
remaining Appointed Directors, by majority vote, shall nominate a replacement
director to serve out the remaining portion of the term, subject to the
approval of Flag. In addition, the Board of Directors of Flag shall elect Mr.
Padget to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Flag.

 

 2.4 _Officers_. The officers of Flag in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall serve as the officers of Flag from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the Bylaws of Flag and H.N. Padget, Jr.
shall be elected by the Flag Board of Directors as an Executive Vice
President of Flag. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of Flag, acting on behalf of Flag as the sole shareholder of
Flag Bank, shall take such action as is appropriate to elect H.N. Padget, Jr.
as President and a director of Flag Bank.

  


  

  **ARTICLE 3**

  **MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES**

 

 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to the provisions of this Article 3,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, the shares of the constituent corporations shall
be converted as follows:

 

 (a) Each share of Flag Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and
after the Effective Time.

 

 (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(d) below and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, each share of FCB Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding shares held by Flag or any of
its Subsidiaries or by FCB or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case other
than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted, and excluding shares held by FCB shareholders who
perfect their dissenters' rights of appraisal as provided in Section 3.4 of
this Agreement) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive 1.6 shares of Flag Common Stock for each share of FCB Common Stock
(the "Exchange Ratio").

 

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, each share of FCB Common Stock as set forth in
Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement shall cease to be outstanding and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of FCB Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive such holder's pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Flag Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 4.1 of this Agreement, without interest.

 

 

(d) In no event shall any holder of Flag Common Stock (other than an
Institutional Investor) , be permitted to receive greater than
384,000 shares of Flag Common Stock as a result of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that receipt by any FCB shareholder of his, her or its pro rata portion of
the shares of Flag Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1(b) would
result in such shareholder receiving greater than 384,000 shares of Flag
Common Stock as a result of the Merger, then the number of shares of Flag
Common Stock to be received by such FCB shareholder shall be reduced by the
number of shares necessary (such amount being the "Excess Shares") such that
the shareholder shall receive no greater than 384,000 shares of Flag Common
Stock as a result of the Merger and, in lieu of such Excess Shares, such
shareholder shall receive a cash payment equal to the Average Closing Price
times the number of Excess Shares.

 

 

3.2 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event FCB changes the number of
shares of FCB Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar recapitalization with
respect to the FCB Common Stock and the record date therefor (in the case of
a stock dividend) or the effective date therefor (in the case of a stock
split or similar recapitalization) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. In the event Flag changes
the number of shares of Flag Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, exchange of shares, or similar
transaction with respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in the
case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of
a stock split, reclassification, exchange of shares, or similar
recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted;
it being understood that no such adjustment will apply to the issuance of
Flag Common Stock or any security convertible into Flag Common Stock, in
either case, for fair market value.

 

 

3.3 _Shares Held by FCB or Flag_. Each of the shares of FCB Common Stock
held by any FCB Companies or by any Flag Companies, in each case other than
shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted, shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time, and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

 

 

3.4 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Each holder of shares of FCB Common Stock
shall be entitled to exercise dissenters' rights of appraisal in accordance
with and as contemplated by Sections 14-2-1301 _et seq_. of the GBCC. Any
holder of shares of FCB Common Stock who perfects his dissenter's right of
appraisal in accordance with and as contemplated by Sections 14-2-1301 et
seq. of the GBCC shall be entitled to receive the value of such shares in
cash as determined pursuant to such provision of Law;  _provided, however_ ,
that no such payment shall be made to any dissenting shareholder unless and
until such dissenting shareholder has complied with the applicable provisions
of the GBCC and surrendered to Flag the certificate or certificates
representing the shares for which payment is being made. In the event that
after the Effective Time a dissenting shareholder of FCB fails to perfect, or
effectively withdraws or loses, his right to appraisal and of payment for his
shares, the Surviving Corporation shall issue and deliver the consideration
to which such shareholder is entitled under this Article 3 (without interest)
upon surrender by such shareholder of his or her certificate or certificates
representing the shares of FCB Common Stock.

 

 

3.5 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of FCB Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger, who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Flag Common Stock (after taking into account all certificates
delivered by such holder), shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Flag
Common Stock multiplied by the market value of one share of Flag Common Stock
at the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 3.5, the market value of
one share of Flag Common Stock at the Effective Time shall be the average
closing price of Flag Common Stock for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the date of Closing as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_
 (corrected for any typographical errors). ** ** No such holder will be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a shareholder in
respect of any fractional shares.

 

 

3.6 _Conversion of Stock Options._

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to FCB Common Stock
pursuant to stock options (the "FCB Options") granted by FCB under the FCB
Option Plans, which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Flag
Common Stock, and Flag shall assume each FCB Option in accordance with the
terms of the FCB Option Plan and the stock option agreement by which it is
evidenced. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each FCB Option assumed by
Flag may be exercised solely for shares of Flag Common Stock, (ii) the number
of shares of Flag Common Stock subject to such FCB Option shall be equal to
the product of the number of shares of FCB Common Stock subject to such FCB
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio and rounding up to the nearest whole share, and (iii) the per share
exercise price under each such FCB Option shall be adjusted by dividing the
per share exercise price under each such FCB Option by the Exchange Ratio and
rounding up to the nearest cent. Flag agrees to take all necessary steps to
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6.

 

 

(b) All restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect to FCB Common
Stock awarded under the FCB Option Plan or any other plan, program or
arrangement of any FCB Company, to the extent that such restrictions or
limitations shall not have already lapsed (whether as a result of the Merger
or otherwise), and except as otherwise expressly provided in such plan,
program or arrangement, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to
shares of Flag Common Stock into which such restricted shares of FCB Common

  **EXCHANGE OF SHARES**

 

 

4.1 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Flag shall
cause the exchange agent selected by Flag (the "Exchange Agent") to mail to
the former shareholders of FCB appropriate transmittal materials (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates theretofore representing shares of FCB Common Stock shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) for the
exchange of the FCB Common stock certificates. After the Effective Time, each
holder of shares of FCB Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement or as to which dissenters' rights
of appraisal have been perfected as provided in Section 3.4 of this
Agreement) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the
certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Exchange Agent
and shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the
consideration provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, together with all
undelivered dividends or distributions in respect of such shares (without
interest thereon) pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Agreement. To the extent
required by Section 3.5 of this Agreement, each holder of shares of FCB
Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time also shall receive,
upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares,
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Flag Common Stock to which such
holder may be otherwise entitled (without interest). Neither Flag nor the
Exchange Agent shall be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any
former holder of FCB Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until
such holder surrenders his or her certificate or certificates representing
the shares of FCB Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1
or appropriate affidavits or indemnity agreements in the event such share
certificates have been lost, mutilated or destroyed. The certificate
or certificates of FCB Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as
either Flag or the Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, neither Flag nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to a holder of FCB Common Stock for any amounts paid or property
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other Law.

 

 

4.2 _Rights of Former Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of FCB shall be closed as to holders of FCB Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no transfer of FCB Common Stock
by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered
for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of this
Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of FCB
Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of
this Agreement or as to which dissenters' rights of appraisal have been
perfected as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement) shall from and after
the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.5 of this Agreement in exchange
therefor. To the extent permitted by Law, former shareholders of record of
FCB shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Flag
shareholders the number of whole shares of Flag Common Stock into which their
respective shares of FCB Common Stock are convertible, regardless of whether
such holders have exchanged their certificates representing FCB Common Stock
for certificates representing Flag Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by Flag on the Flag Common Stock, the record date for which is at or
after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no
dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Flag
Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the holder of any certificate representing shares of FCB Common
Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time until such holder
surrenders such certificate for exchange as provided in Section 4.1 of this
Agreement. However, upon surrender of such FCB Common Stock certificate in
exchange for Flag Common Stock, both the Flag Common Stock certificate
(together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without
interest) and any undelivered cash payments to be paid for fractional share
interests or Excess Shares (in each case without interest) shall be delivered
and paid with respect to each share represented by such certificate.

Plan." Each FCB ERISA Plan which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 3(35) of ERISA) is
referred to herein as an "FCB Pension Plan". No FCB Benefit Plan is or has
been a "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or
4001(a)(3) of ERISA. The FCB Companies do not participate in either a multi-
employer plan (within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
or a multiple employer plan (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code) or a multiple employer welfare arrangement (within the
meaning of Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA).

 

 

(b) The FCB Companies have delivered or made available to Flag prior to the
execution of this Agreement correct and complete copies of the following
documents: (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for such
FCB Benefit Plans (including insurance contracts), and all amendments
thereto, (ii) with respect to any such FCB Benefit Plans or amendments, all
determination letters, Material rulings, Material opinion letters, Material
information letters or Material advisory opinions issued by the IRS, the
United States Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, (iii) annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial
statements, actuarial valuations and reports and summary annual reports
prepared for any FCB Benefit Plan with respect to the most recent plan year,
(iv) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any Material modifications
thereto, (v) all policies of fiduciary liability insurance covering the
fiduciaries for each FCB Benefit Plan, and all bonds pertaining to any FCB
Benefit Plan, (vi) all nondiscrimination tests required by the Internal
Revenue Code for any FCB Benefit Plan for the most recent plan year, and
(vii) all employee handbooks or policy manuals pertaining to employees of any
FCB Company.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.14(c) of the FCB Disclosure Memorandum,
all FCB Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable terms of ERISA,
the Internal Revenue Code, and any other applicable Laws, the breach or
violation of which are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB. Each FCB ERISA Plan which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and no FCB
Company is aware of any circumstances likely to reasonably result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter or failure of an FCB
ERISA Plan intended to satisfy Internal Revenue Code Section 401 to satisfy
the Tax qualification provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
thereto. No transaction with respect to any FCB Benefit Plan that could
subject any FCB Company or any other "party in interest" (as defined in ERISA
Section 3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of
the Internal Revenue Code) to a Material Tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in
amounts which are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.

 

 

(d) No FCB Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Internal Revenue Code. There are no unresolved claims or disputes under
the terms of, or in connection with, the FCB Benefit Plans other than claims
for benefits which are payable in the ordinary course of business and, to the
Knowledge of the FCB Companies, no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry,
hearing or investigation, or threat thereof, has been commenced or made with
respect to any FCB Benefit Plan.

 

 

(e) Within the six-year period preceding the Effective Time, no Liability
under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by the FCB Companies with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any ERISA
Affiliate, which Liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on FCB. Except as Previously Disclosed, no FCB Company has incurred
any withdrawal Liability with respect to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle
B of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an
ERISA Affiliate), which Liability is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FCB. No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived, has been required to be filed for any FCB Pension Plan or by any
ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.

 

 

(f) Except as required under Title I, Part 6 of ERISA and Internal Revenue
Code Section 4980 B, no FCB Company has any obligations to provide health and
life benefits under any of the FCB Benefit Plans to former employees, and
there are no restrictions on the rights of FCB to amend or terminate any such
plan without incurring any Liability thereunder, which Liability is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on FCB. To the Knowledge
of the FCB Companies, no payment or benefit which will or may be made by any
FCB Company to any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c)
of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder) is or would be
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to which a deduction would be disallowed,
and there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract by which any
FCB Company is bound to compensate any employee for excise taxes paid
pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, no
payment or benefit which will or may be made by any FCB Company would be in
violation of 12 C.F.R. §§ 359.0 through 359.7.

 

 

(g) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
solely as a result of such actions, will (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any officer, director or any employee
of the FCB Companies from the FCB Companies under any FCB Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any FCB Benefit
Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of any such benefit, where such payment, increase or acceleration is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FCB.

 

 

(h) The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred compensation
entitlements (including, without limitation, entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of directors
and employees and former directors and employees of the FCB Companies and its
respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded
retirement plans subject to the provisions of Section 412 of the Internal
Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA, have been fully reflected on the FCB
Financial Statements to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

 

 

5.15 _Material Contracts_. Except as disclosed in Section 5.15 of the FCB
Disclosure Memorandum or otherwise reflected in the FCB Financial Statements,
no FCB Company nor any of their respective Assets, businesses or operations,

any employment, severance, termination, consulting or retirement Contract
providing for aggregate payments to any Person in any calendar year in excess
of $100,000, (ii) any Contract relating to the borrowing of money by any FCB
Company or the guarantee by any FCB Company of any such obligation (other
than Contracts evidencing deposit liabilities, purchases of federal funds,
fully-secured repurchase agreements, trade payables, letters of credit and
Contracts relating to borrowings or guarantees made in the ordinary course of
business), (iii) any Contract which prohibits or restricts any FCB Company
from engaging in any business activities in any geographic area, line of
business or otherwise in competition with any other Person, (iv) any Contract
relating to the provision of data processing network communication, or other
technical services to or by any FCB Company, or (v) any other Contract or
amendment thereto that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to an FCB
Regulatory Report filed by FCB with any Regulatory Authority as of the date
of this Agreement and that has not been filed by FCB with any Regulatory
Authority as an exhibit to any FCB Regulatory Report for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004 (together with all Contracts referred to in Sections
5.10 and 5.14(a) of this Agreement, the "FCB Contracts"). With respect to
each FCB Contract, (i) the Contract is in full force and effect, (ii) no FCB
Company is in Default thereunder, other than Defaults which are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FCB, (iii) no FCB Company has repudiated or waived any
material provision of any such Contract, and (iv) no other party to any such
Contract is, to the knowledge of the FCB Companies, in Default in any
respect, other than Defaults which are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB, or

the Knowledge of the FCB Companies, threatened against any FCB Company, or
against any Asset, interest or right of any of them nor are there any Orders
of any Regulatory Authorities, other governmental authorities or arbitrators
outstanding against the FCB Companies, that are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.

 

 

5.17 _Reports_. Other than the FCB SEC Reports (as to which Section 5.5
applies), the FCB Companies have timely filed all reports and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file with Regulatory Authorities (except in the case of
state securities authorities, failures to file which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on FCB). As of their respective dates, each of such reports and documents,
including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied
in all material respects with all applicable Laws. As of their respective
dates, each such report and document did not contain any untrue statement of
a Material fact or omit to state a Material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 

5.18 _Statements True and Correct_. No statement, certificate, instrument
or other writing furnished or to be furnished by the FCB Companies or any
Affiliate thereof to Flag pursuant to this Agreement or any other document,
agreement or instrument referred to herein contains or will contain any

under which they were made, not misleading, or, in the case of the Joint
Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time
of the FCB Meeting be false or misleading with respect to any Material fact,

earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for such
shareholders' meeting. All documents that any FCB Company or any Affiliate

Material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.

 

 

5.19 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. No FCB Company or any Affiliate thereof
has taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is
reasonably likely to (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue

thereof, adequate (within the meaning of GAAP and applicable regulatory
requirements or guidelines) to provide for losses relating to or inherent in
the loan and lease portfolios (including accrued interest receivables) of the

independent contractor of each Flag Company is terminable at will by the
relevant Flag Company without any penalty, liability or severance obligation

(d) Except as disclosed in Section 6.13(d) of the Flag Disclosure Memorandum

6.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) The Flag Companies have disclosed in Section 6.14 of the Flag Disclosure
Memorandum, and delivered or made available to FCB prior to the execution of
this Agreement, correct and complete copies in each case of (i) all pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, employee
stock ownership, phantom stock, share appreciation rights, supplemental
pension, retainer, savings, retirement, severance pay, termination pay,
change of control, vacation, bonus or other incentive plans, (ii) all other
written employee policies, programs, arrangements or agreements of any kind
providing compensation, remuneration or benefits or perquisites of any kind,
(iii) all medical, vision, dental or other health or welfare plans, all life
insurance plans and all other employee benefit plans or fringe benefit plans,
including, without limitation, "employee benefit plans" as that term is
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, (iv) all "specified fringe benefit plans"
as defined in Section 6039D(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, (v) all
"nonqualified deferred compensation plans" as defined in Sections 409A(d)(1)
or 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (vi) all "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, which is
currently adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or
contributed to by, or which has within the past seven years been adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by, any
Flag Companies or any Affiliate thereof for the benefit of current or former
employees, directors, independent contractors, shareholders, officers or
other individuals, or any spouse, child or other dependent of such
individuals or which could result in any liability being asserted against any
Flag Company (collectively, the "Flag Benefit Plans"). Any of the Flag
Benefit Plans which is an "employee welfare benefit plan," as that term is
defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA, or an "employee pension benefit plan," as
that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a
"Flag ERISA Plan." Each Flag ERISA Plan which is also a "defined benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code or Section
3(35) of ERISA) is referred to herein as an "Flag Pension Plan". No Flag
Benefit Plan is or has been a "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of
Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. The Flag Companies do not participate
in either a multi-employer plan (within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a multiple employer plan (within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code) or a multiple employer welfare
arrangement (within the meaning of Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA).

 

 

(b) The Flag Companies have delivered or made available to FCB prior to the
execution of this Agreement correct and complete copies of the following
documents: (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for such
Flag Benefit Plans (including insurance contracts), and all amendments
thereto, (ii) with respect to any such Flag Benefit Plans or amendments, all
determination letters, Material rulings, Material opinion letters, Material
information letters or Material advisory opinions issued by the IRS, the
United States Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, (iii) annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial
statements, actuarial valuations and reports and summary annual reports
prepared for any Flag Benefit Plan with respect to the most recent plan year,
(iv) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any Material modifications
thereto, (v) all policies of fiduciary liability insurance covering the
fiduciaries for each Flag Benefit Plan, and all bonds pertaining to any Flag
Benefit Plan, (vi) all nondiscrimination tests required by the Internal
Revenue Code for any Flag Benefit Plan for the most recent plan year, and
(vii) all employee handbooks or policy manuals pertaining to employees of any
Flag Company.

 

 

(c) All Flag Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable terms of
ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and any other applicable Laws, the breach
or violation of which are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Flag. Each Flag ERISA Plan which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and no Flag
Company is aware of any circumstances likely to reasonably result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter or failure of an Flag
ERISA Plan intended to satisfy Internal Revenue Code Section 401 to satisfy
the Tax qualification provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
thereto. No transaction with respect to any Flag Benefit Plan that could
subject any Flag Company or any other "party in interest" (as defined in
ERISA Section 3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Section
4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code) to a Material Tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA in amounts which are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Flag.

 

 

(d) No Flag Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Internal Revenue Code. There are no unresolved claims or disputes under
the terms of, or in connection with, the Flag Benefit Plans other than claims
for benefits which are payable in the ordinary course of business and, to the
Knowledge of the Flag Companies, no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry,
hearing or investigation, or threat thereof, has been commenced or made with
respect to any Flag Benefit Plan.

 

 

(e) Within the six-year period preceding the Effective Time, no Liability
under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by the Flag Companies with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any ERISA
Affiliate, which Liability is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Flag. Except as Previously Disclosed, no Flag Company has incurred
any withdrawal Liability with respect to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle
B of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an
ERISA Affiliate), which Liability is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Flag. No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived, has been required to be filed for any Flag Pension Plan or by
any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.

 

 

(f) Except as required under Title I, Part 6 of ERISA and Internal Revenue
Code Section 4980 B, no Flag Company has any obligations to provide health
and life benefits under any of the Flag Benefit Plans to former employees,
and there are no restrictions on the rights of Flag to amend or terminate any
such plan without incurring any Liability thereunder, which Liability is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Flag. To the Knowledge
of the Flag Companies, no payment or benefit which will or may be made by any
Flag Company to any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c)
of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder) is or would be
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to which a deduction would be disallowed,
and there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract by which any
Flag Company is bound to compensate any employee for excise taxes paid
pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, no
payment or benefit which will or may be made by any Flag Company would be in
violation of 12 C.F.R. §§ 359.0 through 359.7.

 

 

(g) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
solely as a result of such actions, will (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any officer, director or any employee
of the Flag Companies from the Flag Companies under any Flag Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Flag
Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefit, where such payment, increase or acceleration is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Flag.

 

 

(h) The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred compensation
entitlements (including, without limitation, entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of directors
and employees and former directors and employees of the Flag Companies and
their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to
funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA, have been fully reflected on
the Flag Financial Statements to the extent required by and in accordance
with GAAP.

 

 

6.15 _Material Contracts_. Except as disclosed in Section 6.15 of the Flag
Disclosure Memorandum or otherwise reflected in the Flag Financial
Statements, neither the Flag Companies nor any of their respective Assets,
businesses or operations, is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or

consulting or retirement Contract providing for aggregate payments to any
Person in any calendar year in excess of $100,000, (ii) any Contract relating
to the borrowing of money by any Flag Company or the guarantee by any Flag
Company of any such obligation (other than Contracts evidencing
deposit liabilities, purchases of federal funds, fully-secured repurchase
agreements, trade payables, letters of credit and Contracts relating to
borrowings or guarantees made in the ordinary course of business), (iii) any
Contract which prohibits or restricts any Flag Company from engaging in any
business activities in any geographic area, line of business or otherwise in
competition with any other Person, (iv) any Contract relating to the
provision of data processing network communication, or other technical
services to or by any Flag Company, or (v) any other Contract or amendment
thereto that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to an Flag
Regulatory Report filed by Flag with any Regulatory Authority as of the date
of this Agreement and that has not been filed by Flag with any Regulatory
Authority as an exhibit to any Flag Regulatory Report for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004 (together with all Contracts referred to in Section
6.10 and 6.14(a)of this Agreement, the "Flag Contracts"). With respect to
each Flag Contract, (i) the Contract is in full force and effect, (ii) no
Flag Company is in Default thereunder, other than Defaults which are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Flag, (iii) no Flag Company has repudiated or waived any
material provision of any such Contract, and (iv) no other party to any such
Contract is, to the knowledge of Flag, in Default in any respect, other than
Defaults which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Flag, or has repudiated or waived any
Material provision thereunder. Except as Previously Disclosed, all of the
indebtedness of any Flag Company for money borrowed is prepayable at any time
by Flag without penalty or premium.

Disclosure Memorandum, there is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to
the Knowledge of the Flag Companies, threatened against any Flag Company, or
against any Asset, interest or right of any of them, nor are there any Orders
of any Regulatory Authorities, other governmental authorities or arbitrators
outstanding against any Flag Companies, that are reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Flag.

 

 

6.17 _Reports_. Other than the Flag SEC Reports (as to which Section 6.5
applies), the Flag Companies have timely filed all reports and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file with Regulatory Authorities (except in the case of
state securities authorities, failures to file which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Flag). As of their respective dates, each of such reports and documents,
including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied
in all material respects with all applicable Laws. As of their respective
dates, each such report and document did not contain any untrue statement of
a Material fact or omit to state a Material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 

6.18 _Statements True and Correct_. No statement, certificate, instrument
or other writing furnished or to be furnished by any Flag Companies or any
Affiliate thereof to FCB pursuant to this Agreement or any other document,
agreement or instrument referred to herein contains or will contain any
untrue statement of Material fact or will omit to state a Material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by any Flag Companies or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion in
the Registration Statement to be filed by Flag with the SEC, will, when the
Registration Statement becomes effective, be false or misleading with respect
to any Material fact, or omit to state any Material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading. None of the information supplied or to

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, at the respective
time such documents are filed, and with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement,
when first mailed to the shareholders of FCB, be false or misleading with
respect to any Material fact, or omit to state any Material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, or, in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the FCB
Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any Material fact, or omit to
state any Material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for either of
such shareholders' meetings. All documents that any Flag Company or any
Affiliate thereof is responsible for filing with any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form
in all Material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.

 

 

6.19 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. No Flag Company or any Affiliate
thereof has taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance
that is reasonably likely to (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, or (ii) materially impede or delay receipt of any Consents of
Regulatory Authorities referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or

reasonable and adequate consideration.

 

 

7.5 _Adverse Changes in Condition_. Each Party agrees to give written
notice promptly to the other Party upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of
its Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) is reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a Material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein and to use its reasonable efforts to
prevent or promptly to remedy the same.

 

 

7.6 _Reports_. Each Party and its Subsidiaries shall file all reports
required to be filed by it with Regulatory Authorities between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time and shall deliver to the other Party
copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. If financial
statements are contained in any such reports filed with the Regulatory
Authorities, such financial statements will fairly present the consolidated
financial position of the entity filing such statements as of the dates
indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the periods then ended in accordance
with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to normal
recurring period-end adjustments that are not Material). As of
their respective dates, such reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities
will comply in all Material respects with applicable Securities Laws and will
not contain any untrue statement of a Material fact or omit to state a
Material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any other reports to
another Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with Laws
applicable to such reports.

 

 

7.7 _Certain Modifications._ Flag and FCB shall consult with respect to
their respective loan, litigation, and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) and FCB
shall make such modifications or changes to its policies and practices, if
any, prior to the Effective Time, as may be mutually agreed upon. Flag and
FCB also shall consult with respect to the character, amount, and timing of
restructuring and Merger-related expense charges to be taken by each of the
Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall take such charges in accordance with GAAP as may be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties. Neither Party's representations, warranties, and
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
inaccurate or breached in any respect as a consequence of any modifications
or charges undertaken solely on account of this Section 7.7.

  **ARTICLE 8**

  **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 

 

8.1 _Shareholder Approvals_. Each of FCB and Flag shall take, in
accordance with applicable Law and its respective Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws, all action necessary to convene, respectively, the FCB Meeting to
consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved by FCB shareholders for consummation of the Merger
and the Flag Meeting to consider and vote upon the issuance of the shares of
Flag Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and any other matters required
to be approved by Flag shareholders for consummation of the Merger, as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective. The Board of Directors of each of FCB and Flag shall (subject to
compliance with its fiduciary duties as advised by counsel) by majority vote
recommend such approval by their shareholders, and the Board of Directors of
FCB and Flag (subject to compliance with their fiduciary duties as advised by
counsel) shall use their best efforts to obtain such approval by their
shareholders.

 

 

8.2 _Registration Statement._

 

 

(a) Each of Flag and FCB agrees to cooperate in the preparation of a
Registration Statement to be filed by Flag with the SEC in connection with
the issuance of Flag Common Stock in the Merger (including the Joint Proxy
Statement and all related documents). Provided FCB has cooperated as required
above, Flag agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the date of
this Agreement. Each of FCB and Flag agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the 1933 Act
as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof. Flag also agrees
to use all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. FCB agrees to furnish Flag all information
concerning FCB, the FCB Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors
and shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
foregoing.

 

 

(b) Each of FCB and Flag agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the
time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if
any, becomes effective under the 1933 Act, contain any untrue statement of a
Material fact or omit to state any Material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at
the date of mailing to FCB shareholders and at the time of the FCB Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a Material fact or omit to state any Material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading with respect to any Material fact, or which will omit
to state any Material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein
not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
statement in the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto. Each of FCB and Flag further agrees that if it shall become aware
prior to the Effective Date of any information that would cause any of the
statements in the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any Material fact, or to omit to state any Material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform
the other Party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Joint
Proxy Statement.

 

 

(c) Flag will advise FCB, promptly after Flag receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, or of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of the Flag Common Stock for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding
for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or
supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information.

 

 

(d) Nothing in this Section 8.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit accurate disclosure by FCB of information that is required to be
disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement or in
any other document required to be filed with the SEC (including, without
limitation, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9) or
otherwise required to be publicly disclosed by applicable Law.

 

 

8.3 _Applications_. Flag shall promptly prepare and file, and the FCB
Companies shall cooperate in the preparation and, where appropriate, filing
of, applications with all Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement seeking the requisite Consents
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Flag
shall permit the FCB Companies to review (and approve with respect to
information relating to the FCB Companies) such applications prior to filing
the same.

 

 

8.4 _Filings with State Office_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Flag shall execute and file the Articles of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia in connection with
the Closing.

 

 

8.5 _Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use its reasonable efforts
to take all actions, and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws, as promptly as practicable so as to
permit consummation of the Merger at the earliest possible date and to
otherwise enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall cooperate fully with the other Party hereto to that end including,
without limitation, using its reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order
adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 9
of this Agreement; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude either Party
from exercising its rights under this Agreement. Each Party shall use, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts to obtain
all Consents necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

8.6 _Investigation and Confidentiality._

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party will keep the other Party
advised of all Material developments relevant to its business and to
consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or cause
to be made such investigation of the business and properties of it and its
Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal conditions as the
other Party reasonably requests, provided that such investigation shall be
reasonably related to the transaction contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No investigation by a Party
shall affect the representations and warranties of the other Party.

 

 

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain
the confidentiality of all Confidential Information furnished to it by any
other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses, operations and
financial condition except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that a Party is required by applicable Law or
valid court process to disclose any such Confidential Information, then such
Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any such
requirement so that the other Party may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this Section 8.6. If in the
absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by
the other Party, a Party is nonetheless, in the written opinion of counsel,
legally compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information to any
tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
penalty, a Party may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal
only that portion of the Confidential Information which such counsel advises
such Party is legally required to be disclosed; provided that such disclosing
Party uses its best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information, including without limitation, by cooperating with
the other Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information by such tribunal. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall promptly return all documents and copies
thereof and all work papers containing Confidential Information received from
the other Party.

 

 

(c) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as practicable
after any determination by it of any fact or occurrence relating to the other
Party which it has discovered through the course of its investigation and
which represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either a Material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the other
Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the other Party.

 

 

(d) Neither Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client or similar privilege with respect to such information or
contravene any Law, rule, regulation, Order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties
will use their reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, to the extent practicable, in circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

 

8.7 _Press Releases_. Prior to the Effective Time, FCB and Flag shall
consult with each other as to the form and substance of any press release or
other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this
Section 8.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure
which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such
Party's disclosure obligations imposed by Law.

 

 

8.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) Effective as of the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of (1)
the Effective Time and (2) the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant
to the provisions of Section 10.1, neither Party will take nor will any Party
permit any of its directors, officers, agents, employees, Affiliates,
attorneys, accountants, financial advisers or other representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") to (directly or indirectly): (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage or take any action intended to encourage the submission
of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with
respect to, an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by shareholders, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent any Party from furnishing information to, or engaging in negotiations
or discussions with, any Person in connection with an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal by such Person, if and to the extent that (x)
such Party's Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, and such Party's Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel), in the exercise of
its fiduciary duties, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duty to the shareholders of such Party, (y) prior to furnishing
such information to, or engaging in negotiations or discussions with, such
Person, such Party's Board of Directors receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no more favorable to such Party than
those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement to which the Party is bound,
and (z) such Party gives the other Party five business days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action.

 

 

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 8.8, neither Party's Board of
Directors shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, change or modify, in each case
in a manner adverse to the Party, the approval or recommendation by such
Party's Board of Directors of this Agreement, and the Merger, (ii) approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior
to the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Party's shareholders, such Party's
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its
advisors), in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, that (x) the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (y) to do otherwise would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duty to the shareholders of any Party,
after giving five business days' prior written notice to the other Party,
specifying the material terms thereof and the identity of the party making
such proposal; provided, however, the identity of the party making such
proposal shall not be identified if any Party is prohibited from such making
disclosure pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement, such Party's
Board of Directors may (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, change or modify its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger or (B) enter
into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, and shall, in the case
of (B), terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1;
_provided, however_ , that any Party shall have caused its financial and
legal advisors to negotiate in good faith with any Party during such five
business days to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable any Party to proceed with the Merger on such
adjusted terms. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal as of the date hereof. Both Parties agree that its
obligation to hold a meeting of its shareholders or to otherwise submit this
Agreement to its stockholders shall not be affected by the withholding,
withdrawal, amendment, change or modification of its approval
or recommendation in accordance with clause (A) above.

 

 

(c) The Parties will promptly (but in any event not later than 24 hours
after its written receipt thereof) notify the other Party in writing of the
existence of any proposal, discussion or negotiation received by either Party
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and each Party will promptly communicate
to the other Party the identity of the party making such proposal or
engaging in such discussion or negotiation and the material terms of any
proposal, discussion or negotiation that it may receive regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, but the Parties shall not be required to disclose the
identity of the party making such proposal or engaging in such discussion or
negotiation if prohibited from doing so pursuant to the terms of a written
confidentiality agreement. Each Party will promptly provide to the other
Party any information concerning the Party provided to any other Person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to
any Party. The Parties will keep each other fully informed on a prompt basis
of any discussions or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal and
of any amendments or proposed amendments to any of the material terms of
any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(d) Each Party acknowledges that this Section 8.8 was a significant
inducement for each Party to enter into this Agreement and the absence of
such provision would have resulted in either (i) a material reduction in the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the security holders of FCB or (ii) a
failure to induce Flag to enter into this Agreement.

 

 

8.9 _Tax Treatment_. Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which would
cause the Merger not, to qualify for treatment as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income
tax purposes.

 

 

8.10 _Agreement of Affiliates_. FCB has disclosed in Section 8.10 of the
FCB Disclosure Memorandum all Persons whom it reasonably believes is an
"affiliate" of FCB for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933 Act. FCB shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause each such Person to deliver to Flag not later
than 30 days after the date of this Agreement, a written agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit B, providing that such Person will not
sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of FCB Common Stock
held by such Person except as contemplated by such agreement or by this
Agreement and will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of
the shares of Flag Common Stock to be received by such Person upon
consummation of the Merger except in compliance with applicable provisions of
the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (and Flag shall be
entitled to place restrictive legends upon certificates for shares of Flag
Common Stock issued to affiliates of FCB pursuant to this Agreement to
enforce the provisions of this Section 8.10). Flag shall not be required to
maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the 1933 Act
for the purposes of resale of Flag Common Stock by such affiliates.

 

 

8.11 _Employee Benefits and Contracts_. Following the Effective Time, Flag
shall provide generally to officers and employees of the FCB Companies, who
at or after the Effective Time become employees of a Flag Company
(collectively, "New Flag Employees"), employee benefits under employee
benefit plans on terms and conditions which when taken as a whole are
substantially similar to those currently provided by the Flag Companies to
their similarly situated officers and employees. Subject to the requirements
of the immediately succeeding sentence, Flag may apply any pre-existing
condition exclusion or waiting period under any Flag employee health plan for
which any employees and/or officers and dependents covered by FCB Benefit
Plans as of Closing shall become eligible but that portion of any such
existing condition exclusion or waiting period shall not be enforced to
the extent it exceeds in duration to the corresponding provision in effect
under the FCB Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing. ** **
For purposes of participation, vesting and benefit accrual under all
qualified benefit plans, the service of the employees of the FCB Companies
prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with the Flag
Companies participating in all qualified benefit plans. Flag shall credit New
Flag Employees for amounts paid under FCB Benefit Plans for the plan year
including the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out of pocket maximums under the Flag Benefit Plans.

 

 

8.12 _D andO Coverage. _Beginning at the Effective Time and subject to
applicable Law, Flag will provide continuing indemnification for FCB's
directors and officers to the same extent provided by FCB prior to the
Effective Time and use its reasonable best efforts to provide directors and
officers insurance coverage for FCB's directors and officers either, at
Flag's election, (i) by purchasing continuation coverage under FCB's current
policy for directors and officers for a period not less than three years
after the Effective Time, or (ii) if Flag's current directors' and officers'
policy provides substantially similar coverage as FCB's current policy,
obtain coverage under Flag's current policy to provide coverage for FCB's
directors and officers on a prior acts basis for a period not less than three
years prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

8.13 _Listing on Nasdaq National Market._ Prior to the Effective Time,
Flag shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Flag Common
Stock to be issued to the holders of the FCB Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market or such other market as
Flag Common Stock is then listed.

 

 

8.14 _SmartStreet Documentation_. Prior to the Closing, FCB shall deliver
to Flag reasonably complete machine-readable master-reproducible copies of
the SmartStreet computer software (the "SmartStreet Software"), reasonably
complete corresponding source code listings, reasonably complete technical
documentation, including without limitation a true and accurate description
of pertinent details regarding the architecture of the SmartStreet Software,
and reasonably complete user manuals for the most current releases or
versions thereof and for all earlier releases or versions thereof currently
being supported by FCB so that a reasonably trained programmer could provide
such support and development services that may be reasonably necessary for
the SmartStreet Software, including addressing and resolving all
known material bugs, errors, workarounds or performance or
functionality issues.

result in the violation of any Law. No such waiver shall be effective unless
in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of FCB.

 

 

(c) The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of
any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of such Party at a
later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this Agreement. No
waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this
Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of any
other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

 

 

11.7 _Assignment_. Except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any Party hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

11.12 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
