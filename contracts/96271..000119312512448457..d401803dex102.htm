Section 6.2 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto
shall cooperate with the other party and use its respective commercially

applicable Antitrust Laws) and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means
the applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

(b) Each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to any
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each party hereto shall have the right to review in advance and
to the extent practicable each will consult the other party on, all the
information relating to the other party and its Affiliates, as the

 



22  case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions. Each party shall have the right to attend conferences
and meetings between another party and regulators concerning the Transactions.
In this regard, the party requesting any such conference or meeting with a
regulator shall, to the extent practicable, notify the other party at least
three (3) Business Days in advance of such conference or meeting.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.2, each party hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a
Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions.

commercially reasonable efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or
delay the consummation of the Transactions, on or before the Walk-Away Date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that such party shall not be required to defend
through litigation any claim asserted by any Person and (ii) avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as
to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably

undertaking such efforts to pay any form of compensation or other
consideration or create an obligation to enter into or modify any form of
relationship, arrangement or agreement with any third party.

Section 6.3 _Public Announcements_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each be
entitled to issue an initial press release with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions (a copy of which shall be shared with the other party and
each party shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release in advance of its announcement). Each party acknowledges and agrees
that each partys initial press release shall be released on the same day and
during the same time period. Thereafter, each party may make (i) any public
statements regarding this Agreement or the Transactions as may be required by
Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a national securities exchange
or national market system as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such statement or (ii) public statements with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions, whether oral or written, in connection
with shareholder reports, earnings announcements or communications with stock
market analysts; _provided_ , _however_ that such statements are consistent
with the information contained in the initial press releases or the statements
made in accordance with clause (i) of this sentence.

(a) Upon reasonable request and written notice, subject to applicable Laws

reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Entities to afford to the Purchaser
and the Purchasers representatives

 



23  reasonable access during normal business hours to the Acquired Entities
books, Contracts and records and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Acquired Entities to furnish promptly to the Purchaser
such information concerning their business and properties as the Purchaser may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Seller or any
Acquired Entity; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Seller shall not be
obligated to cause the Acquired Entities to provide such access or information
if the Seller determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would (i)
cause significant competitive harm to the Seller, any Acquired Entity, or
their respective businesses if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not consummated, (ii) violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third-party or (iii) jeopardize the protection
of an attorney-client privilege. Until the Closing, the information provided
will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) No later than fifteen (15) days following the end of each calendar month
prior to the Closing, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser (i) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Entities as of the end of

during business hours to CGESJs power plant facilities for the purpose of
reviewing the physical plant facilities which are the subject of the
operations and maintenance report referred to in the preceding paragraph. 

(d) The Purchaser acknowledges that the confidential information provided to
it by the Seller or the Acquired Entities prior to the Closing in connection
with this Agreement and the terms hereof, to the extent it relates to the
Seller (but not the Acquired Entities, if the Closing occurs), shall be deemed
confidential information and shall be used by the Purchaser only
in connection with the Transactions and for no other purpose.

(e) The Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Entities to reasonably cooperate
with the Seller and its Affiliates (at the sole cost and expense of the Seller
and its Affiliates) and their counsel in connection with the CAFTA Claim,
which cooperation will include, but not be limited to, the following: (A)
if requested by the Seller or its Affiliates, the Purchaser will cause
officers, directors, and employees of the Acquired Entities to (i) appear for
a reasonable number of interviews, at reasonable times and locations, and (ii)

schedules) relating to such CAFTA Claim within the Acquired Entities custody
and control, which it is reasonably requested to produce by the Seller or its
Affiliates, and (C) upon reasonable notice from the Seller or its Affiliates,
the Purchaser shall instruct the officers, directors and employees of the
Acquired Entities to (i) appear for a reasonable number of hearings,
depositions and at trial or arbitral proceeding (including as witnesses)

Seller and its Affiliates to assist in preparation for such depositions and

Section 6.5 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that it shall preserve and keep any books, records
and other documents relating to the businesses of the Acquired Entities for a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date and shall make such records
available for inspection and copying to the Seller as may be reasonably
required. No such books, records or documents shall be destroyed by the
Purchaser without first advising the Seller in writing and giving the Seller
a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof.

(b) After the Closing, each party shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to
the other party reasonable access during normal business hours to such
information and employees as may be reasonably required by such party and
relating to the Acquired Entities in connection with, among other things, (i)
financial reporting, accounting and Tax matters, (ii) any insurance claims by,
suits, actions, claims, or proceedings against or investigations of, any party
or (iii) in order to enable any party to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated
hereby. No party shall be required by this Section 6.5(b) to take any action
that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations or be reasonably expected to
violate any attorney-client privilege of a party or its Affiliates or violate
any applicable Law.

 

Section 6.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, (a) the Purchaser shall pay its own fees, costs and expenses incurred
in connection herewith and the Transactions and (b) the Seller shall pay its
own fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
Transactions.

 

Section 6.7 _Directors and Officers._

(a) Immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser shall take all such
action as shall be required to release resigning directors and officers of the
Acquired Entities from liability in connection with their service as
directors and officers of the Acquired Entities. For such purpose, the
Purchaser shall take all necessary actions to carry out an equity holders
meeting for each Acquired Entity immediately after the Closing, in which
the equity holders of each Acquired Entity shall accept the resignation of
each such director and officer, effective as of the date of issuance of each
resignation letter, and grant the release pursuant to this Section 6.7. The

 



25  Purchaser shall take all necessary actions to provide each resigning
director and officer of the Acquired Entities with the appropriate document
that evidences such release. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each resigning director and officer of the Acquired Entities
to release the Purchaser and its Affiliates from any and all liability to such
resigning Person in connection with their service as directors and officers
of the Acquired Entities. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each such resigning director and officer of the Acquired Entities to
provide to the Purchaser and its Affiliates with a release of any and all
liability to such resigning Person except as specifically provided by this
Agreement.

(b) From, and for a period of six (6) years following, the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause each Acquired Entity to, indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of each Acquired Entity
(each, a " _Indemnified Director"_ , collectively, the " _Indemnified
Directors_ "), who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such Indemnified
Director is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such Acquired
Entity, against any and all costs or expenses (including, without limitation,
travel expenses and reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in defense or settlement or
otherwise arising out of or pertaining to any facts or events existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date to the extent permitted as of the
date hereof by applicable Law and by the Company Charter Documents of such
Acquired Entity, as applicable. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause each
Acquired Entity to, advance expenses to an Indemnified Director, as incurred,
to the extent such advances are permitted as of the date hereof by applicable
Law and by the Company Charter Documents of such Acquired Entity; _provided_ ,
that the Indemnified Director to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Director is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Closing Date), (i) the Indemnified Directors shall promptly
notify the Purchaser and the applicable Acquired Entity thereof, (ii) any
counsel retained by the Indemnified Director for any period after the Closing
Date shall be subject to the consent of the Purchaser and the
applicable Acquired Entity (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (iii) none of the Purchaser and the applicable
Acquired Entity shall be obligated to pay for more than one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Directors, except to the extent that (A) an Indemnified
Director has been advised by counsel that there are conflicting interests
between it and any other Indemnified Director, or (B) local counsel, in
addition to such other counsel, is required to effectively defend against
such action or proceedings, and (iv) none of the Purchaser and the applicable
Acquired Entity shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Purchaser and the applicable Acquired Entity
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Director when and
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine (and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable) that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Director in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law.

 



26 (c) If the Purchaser or any Acquired Entity or any of their successors or
assigns (i) shall merge or consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the surviving or continuing entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of their respective properties and assets to any individual, corporation or
other entity, then in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors or assigns of the Purchaser or such Acquired Entity shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

Section 6.8 _Related-Party Transactions_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller and the Acquired Entities shall terminate, with no further liability
to any of the Acquired Entities, all contracts between any Acquired Entity and
the Seller or its Affiliates (other than those contracts set forth on Section
6.8 of the Disclosure Schedule).

Section 6.9 _TECO Marks_. TECO Marks will appear on some of the assets of the
Acquired Entities, including on signage at the facilities of the Acquired
Entities, and on supplies, materials, stationery, brochures, advertising
materials, manuals and similar consumable items of the Acquired Entities. The
Purchaser shall, (i) within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, remove,
cover or conceal the TECO Marks from the assets of the Acquired Entities,
including signage at the facilities of the Acquired Entities, and provide
written verification thereof to the Seller promptly after completing such
removal and (ii) within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, return or
destroy (with proof of destruction) all other assets of the Acquired Entities
that contain any TECO Marks that are not removed, covered or concealed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall be authorized to continue to
use for internal purposes only and not for public use, materials bearing such
TECO Marks (including manuals) used by the Seller and the Acquired Entities
prior to the Closing for up to two (2) months following the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, use of the TECO Marks shall remain under the
control of the Seller and all goodwill associated with the TECO Marks shall
remain with the Seller. Subject to the terms of the preceding sentences, the
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has and, upon consummation of the
Transactions contemplated hereby shall have, no right, title, interest,
license, or any other right whatsoever to use the TECO Marks. The Purchaser
agrees never to challenge the Sellers (or its Affiliates) ownership of the
TECO Marks or any application for registration thereof or any registration
thereof or any rights of the Seller or its Affiliates therein as a result,
directly or indirectly, of their ownership of the Acquired Entities. The
Purchaser will not conduct any business nor offer any goods or services under
any TECO Marks. The Purchaser will not send, or cause to be sent, any
correspondence or other materials to any Person on any stationery that
contains any TECO Marks or otherwise operate the Acquired Entities in any
manner which would or might reasonably be expected to confuse any Person into
believing that the Purchaser has any right, title, interest or license to use
any TECO Marks. Nothing herein shall be construed as granting the Purchaser
the right to use the TECO Marks in any manner or for any purpose inconsistent
with or to any greater extent than the current use of such TECO Marks by the
Acquired Entities.

 



27 Section 6.10 _Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents
or waivers with respect to the Transactions may be required, including with
respect to the Contracts of the Operating Entities and that such consents have
not been obtained. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain on behalf of the Purchaser such consents; provided that the Purchaser
acknowledges that the Sellers obligation under this Section 6.10 shall not
include any obligation on the part of the Seller or any of its Affiliates to
enter into or modify any form of relationship, arrangement or agreement with
any third party or require the payment by the Seller or any of its Affiliates
of any compensation or other consideration. The Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that the Seller shall not have any liability or obligation whatsoever
to the Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents that may be required in connection with the Transactions or because
of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof. The Purchaser agrees
that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller contained in this
Agreement shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be
deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any
consent, (b) any such termination or (c) any lawsuit, action, proceeding or
investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any termination.

 

Section 6.11 _Non-Solicitation_. Beginning on the date hereof and continuing
until the date which is twenty four (24) months after the Closing Date, the
Seller and its Affiliates shall not initiate, knowingly solicit or knowingly
encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer for employment
or employ, including as consultant or independent contractor, any person who
on the Closing Date is an employee, officer or manager of any of the Acquired
Entities and that resides in Guatemala, except with the express written
permission of the Purchaser in each instance; provided, that the foregoing
restriction will not apply to (i) general solicitations for employees not
specifically directed at any such person, (ii) general mandates given to
recruitment consultants or (iii) soliciting or hiring any person who was
not employed by any of the Acquired Entities at any time during the thirty
(30) days prior to such solicitation or hiring.

 

Section 6.12 _Exclusivity_. Between the date hereof and the earlier to occur
of the Closing Date or termination in accordance with Section 9.1: (a) the
Seller shall not and shall cause each of the Acquired Entities not to,
directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise
facilitate any inquiry, proposal, offer or discussion with any party (other
than the Purchaser) concerning any Acquisition Transaction, (ii) furnish any
information concerning the business, properties or assets of the Acquired
Entities to any Person (other than the Purchaser) or (iii) engage
in discussions or negotiations with any party (other than the Purchaser)
concerning any such transaction; and (b) the Seller shall and shall cause the
Acquired Entities to (i) immediately cease any discussions or negotiations of
the nature described in clause (a) of this Section that were pending, (ii)
refrain from entering into any Acquisition Transaction, and (iii) promptly
advise the Purchaser in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any
inquiry, proposal or other materials, and of any discussions, negotiations or
proposals relating to, an Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller and its
Affiliates will not be in violation of this Section 6.12 in connection with

 



28  any discussions or proposals relating to an Acquisition Transaction with
C.F. Financeco, Ltd. (or any of its successors or assigns) in connection with
the Option Agreement.

 

Section 6.13 _Commitment Letters_. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to comply with its obligations and enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letters in a timely manner and shall not permit any amendment or
modification thereto, or any waiver of any provision or remedy thereunder,
which would have the effect of introducing an additional condition to such
counterparties obligations, reducing the amount of the commitments thereunder
or delaying the Closing. If any portion of the financing contemplated pursuant
to the Commitment Letters (the " _Financing_ ") becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters, the Purchaser
shall notify the Seller within two (2) Business Days and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on substantially the same terms (including pricing) in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. The Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide the
Purchaser with any portion of the financing necessary to consummate the
Transactions. The Purchaser shall give the Seller notice within two (2)
Business Days of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letters,
or any termination of the Commitment Letters. The Purchaser shall refrain (and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to refrain)
from taking, directly, or indirectly, any action that would result in a
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Commitment Letters or in any
definitive agreements related to the Financing. The Purchaser shall not agree
to or permit any material amendment, supplement or other modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing that
would materially and adversely affect or delay in any material respect the
Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions, without first obtaining
the Sellers prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Any material breach by the Purchaser of the
Commitment Letters and/or any related fee or engagement letter shall be deemed
a material breach by the Purchaser of this Section 6.13. The Purchaser will
provide to the Seller any modifications or amendments to the
Commitment Letters, or any material notices given in connection therewith,
promptly but in any event within two (2) Business Days.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

 _POST-CLOSING TAX MATTERS_

Section 7.1 _Tax Filings_. The Seller shall cause the Acquired Entities to
file all Tax returns due on or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall
be responsible for preparing and shall cause the Acquired Entities to file
all Tax returns that are due after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller shall have the right to review and approve any such Tax
return which relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a draft copy of which shall
be provided to the Seller not later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the applicable due date thereof); provided that

 



29  such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. All Tax returns that are
filed pursuant to this Section 7.1, in the absence of a controlling change in
any Law or circumstances, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
elections, accounting methods, conventions and principles of taxation used for
the most recent taxable periods for which Tax returns have been filed and in a
manner that does not accelerate deductions or defer income between Tax
periods, except as otherwise required by any applicable Law.

 

Section 7.2 _Pre-Closing and Straddle-Period Taxes._

(a) Taxes relating to a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing
Date Tax Period or Post-Closing Date Tax Period for purposes of determining
the portion of such Taxes that are Pre-Closing Taxes as follows: Taxes
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date
shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to income or
receipts, or imposed on a transactional basis, be deemed equal to the amount
of Tax that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing
Date; and (ii) in the case of other Taxes, determined by allocating such Taxes
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period on a per
diem basis. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any
exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual
basis shall be allocated pro rata per day between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date. The parties
hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the
relevant Tax authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short
taxable period ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) Following the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser will cooperate with
each other, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other, in the
preparation of any Tax returns and in the conduct of any audit or other
proceeding related to Taxes involving or relating to the Acquired Entities
(which cooperation will include the retention and, upon request, the
provision to the requesting party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to the preparation of such Tax return or to the conduct of
such audit or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder). The Purchaser and the Seller agree (i) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired
Entities relating to any Pre-Closing Date Tax Period, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and (ii) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, shall allow such other party
to take possession of such books and records. The Purchaser will promptly
provide the Seller with written notification in the manner set forth in (and
subject to the terms of) Section 11.9 of any notice of any Tax audits or other
assessments against any of the Acquired Entities involving any Pre-Closing Tax
Periods.

 

(c) The Seller shall control and participate in all proceedings taken in
connection with the conduct of any audit or other administrative or judicial
proceeding related to Pre-

 



30  Closing Taxes for which the Seller is obligated to provide indemnification
under this Agreement (other than Taxes relating to a Straddle Period), and the
Seller will reasonably consult with the Purchaser prior to any settlement
thereof and will not enter into any such settlement without the Purchasers
prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such settlement could result in an increase in any Taxes for
which the Purchaser is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

(d) The Seller and the Purchaser will jointly control and participate in all
proceedings taken in connection with the conduct of any audit or other
proceeding related to Taxes of any of the Acquired Entities for any Straddle
Period. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser will settle any assessment or
claim made by any Governmental Authority in any such audit or other proceeding
without the prior written consent of the others (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 7.3 _Post-Closing Actions; Refunds_.

(a) _Post-Closing Actions_. The Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or
permit its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) to, take any action
during any Straddle Period, outside of the ordinary course of business, or
make any election, that could increase the Sellers liability for Taxes
(including any liability of the Seller to indemnify the Purchaser for Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement) except in each case as may be required by
applicable Law, this Agreement or any other agreement entered into by an
Acquired Entity prior to the Closing (in which case the Purchaser will provide
written notice to the Seller of such action or election and the consequences
thereof not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to taking such action
or making such election). The Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or
permit the Acquired Entities to, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
return for any period that includes, or ends on or prior to, the Closing
Date, in each case, without the Sellers prior written approval (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Purchaser shall not
make, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) not to
make, (i) any election under Section 338 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
(the " _Code_ ") (or any comparable election under the Law of any U.S. state
or local jurisdiction) with respect to the acquisition of the Acquired
Entities without the prior written consent of the Seller (which the Seller may
grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion), or (ii) any election
provided under U.S. federal, state or local Law with respect to the Acquired
Entities (including any election pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3), which election would be effective on or prior to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not
cause or permit the Acquired Entities to, make any election under foreign Law
that would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date which could increase
the Sellers liability for Taxes (including any liability of the Seller to
indemnify the Purchaser for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement). Following the
Closing, the Seller will in good faith cooperate with the Purchaser to the
extent reasonably requested by the Purchaser, to determine the consequences of
any proposed restructuring of the Purchaser, any of the Acquired Entities or
the financing of any thereof that could have an effect on the Seller during
any Straddle Period.

 



31 (b) _Proceedings_. The Purchaser shall control and participate in all
proceedings taken in connection with the conduct of any audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding related to Post-Closing Taxes for which
the Purchaser is obligated to provide indemnification under this agreement
(other than Taxes relating to a Straddle Period), and the Purchaser will
reasonably consult with the Seller prior to any settlement thereof and will
not enter into any such settlement without the Sellers prior written approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement
could result in an increase in any Taxes of the Seller for which the Seller is
not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

(c) _Refunds_. Any refunds or credits of Taxes paid by, for or on behalf of
the Acquired Entities relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (plus any
interest actually received with respect thereto and including refunds or
credits arising from amended Tax returns filed on or after the Closing Date)
shall be for the Sellers account and, if received by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities), shall be paid to the Seller
within ten (10) Business Days after such receipt by the Purchaser or such
Affiliate (including the Acquired Entities); _provided_ , that such refunds or
credits of Taxes shall be for the Sellers account only if and to the extent
that the Tax liability to which the refund or credit relates was paid by an
Acquired Entity prior to the Closing Date or paid (or actually indemnified) by
the Seller.

right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not be

as of such date the only condition to the Closing which has not been 

 



34  satisfied or waived is the condition to Closing set forth in Section 8.1(a),

defend and hold harmless the Purchaser, each Affiliate of the Purchaser
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) and each of their
respective officers, directors, and employees (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Group_ ") from and against and pay or reimburse, as the case may be, the
Purchaser Group for, any and all Damages actually paid or suffered by any
member of the Purchaser Group based upon or arising out of:

 

(a) the breach by the Seller of any of the Sellers representations and
warranties contained in Article III and Article IV; 

(b) the breach by the Seller of any covenant or agreement of the Seller
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Seller to be observed or
performed;

(c) any Pre-Closing Taxes, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall not
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Group, from any liability for Pre-
Closing Taxes attributable to any action taken after the Closing by the
Purchaser, any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired 

 



36  Entities), or any transferee of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Entities) if such action was taken in breach of
Section 7.3(a) (a " _Purchaser Tax Act_ "); or

(d) any federal, state, local or foreign taxes, charges, fees, imposts,
transaction taxes, levies or other assessments in respect of income and/or
gains of the Seller (including income taxes, profit taxes, capital gains taxes
and withholding taxes in respect thereof), and all value added taxes and stamp
taxes, if any, imposed in connection with the Restructuring and the sale of
the Acquired Company Interests (collectively, the " _Seller Taxes_ ").

 

Section 10.2 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. The Purchaser will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Seller, each Affiliate of the Seller and each of
their respective officers, directors, and employees (collectively, the "
_Seller Group_ ") from and against, and pay or reimburse, as the case may be,
the Seller Group for, any and all Damages actually paid or suffered by any
member of the Seller Group based upon or arising out of:

(a) the breach by the Purchaser of any representations and warranties
contained in Article V;

(b) the breach by the Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement on the part of the Purchaser to be observed or
performed; or

(c) any Post-Closing Taxes or any liability for Pre-Closing Taxes that in
each case is attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act.

 

Section 10.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party by a Person
not a party hereto (or an Affiliate thereof) with respect to any matter by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof) which
may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party
will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable
detail of the Third Party Claim, including the factual basis for the Third
Party Claim and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying the Indemnifying Party will affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations under this Article X, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced as a result thereof (except that the Indemnifying Party
will not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the
Indemnified Party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified
Partys receipt thereof, copies of all non-ministerial notices and documents
(including court papers) received or transmitted by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



37 (b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or to assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice. The Indemnifying Party will be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during any period in which
the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party
Claim as provided above). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim the
Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense, may retain separate counsel
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood
that the Indemnifying Party will control such defense and any such counsel
shall cooperate with the legal counsel of the Indemnifying Party.

(c) No Indemnifying Party will consent to any settlement, compromise or
discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment) of any Third Party
Claim without each Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that if
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of
such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which
by its terms unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and each member of
such Indemnified Partys Group completely from all liability in connection
with such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party may refuse to agree to any such settlement, compromise or discharge that
provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified
Party or any member of such Indemnified Partys Group. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will not and will cause its Affiliates not to, admit any
liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge with respect to any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of
all material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense thereof, which cooperation
will include the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 

(e) Any claim on account of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement that does not involve a Third Party Claim will be
asserted by reasonably prompt written notice given by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is sought. The notice
shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an 

 



38  estimate of the foreseeable maximum amount, of claimed Damages and a
description of the basis for such claim. The delay by any Indemnified Party to
so notify the Indemnifying Party will not affect the Indemnifying Partys
obligations under this Article X, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

(f) In connection with any matter for which a claim or demand is made against
an Indemnified Party under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Indemnifying Party with
reasonable and necessary access to all documents, data, products, product
exemplars and knowledgeable personnel of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates relevant to any such matter, in each case at the
Indemnified Partys cost and expense. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall, at its own cost and expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates to, provide employees to act as witnesses,
prepare and execute statements, authorizations, orders, reports and other
documents and information and provide such other assistance, in each case that
is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection with any
matter for which a claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party under
this Agreement, including in anticipation of, or preparation for, existing or
future litigation or other matters in which the Indemnifying Party or any of
its Affiliates is involved.

(g) In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnified Party in connection with any claim (an " _Indemnified Claim_ "),
such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place of
such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which
such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim relating to such
Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Indemnified
Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party will cooperate with
such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner in prosecuting any subrogated
right or claim. Each such Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party will duly
execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 

Section 10.4 _Certain Limitations_.

(a) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement will be reduced by any amounts actually received
(including amounts received under insurance policies) by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party from third parties (net of out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with seeking to collect and collecting such amounts), in
respect of such Damages (such net amounts are referred to herein as "
_Indemnity Reduction Amounts_ "). If any Indemnified Party receives
any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect of an Indemnified Claim for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement after the full amount of such
Indemnified Claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or after an
Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such Indemnified Claim and
such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such
Indemnified Claim, then the

 



39  Indemnified Party will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Indemnified Claim, less (ii) the amount
of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction
Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was
made. An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay
any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or,
solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any
subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and
agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to any
benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof.
The Seller and the Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement.

(b) The amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement will reduced to take account of any Tax benefit actually realized by
the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Damages.

(c) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Seller will not have any obligation to indemnify any member of the Purchaser
Group with respect to any matter if the Damages arise from a change in the
accounting or Tax policies or practices of any of the Acquired Entities after
the Closing Date.

 

(d) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
excluding a partys breach of its confidentiality obligations, no member of
the Seller Group and no member of the Purchaser Group will be entitled to any
recovery under this Agreement for special, punitive, exemplary, incidental,
indirect, or consequential damages, lost profits or diminution in value. No
Damages shall be determined or increased based on any multiple of any
financial measure (including earnings, sales or other benchmarks) that might
have been used by the Purchaser in the valuation of the Acquired Company
Interests, the Acquired Entities or their respective businesses and
operations.

(e) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article X for any breach of a representation or warranty hereunder if (1) such
Indemnified Party had actual knowledge of such breach on or before Closing and
(2) the Indemnifying Party did not have actual knowledge of such breach (or
the facts giving rise to such breach) on or before the Closing. Solely for
purposes of this Section 10.4(e) "actual knowledge" as it relates to (i) the
Purchaser shall mean the actual knowledge of Luis Kafie, Luis Jose Kafie and
Christopher Kafie and (ii) the Seller shall mean with respect to the Operating
Entities, the actual knowledge of Victor Urrutia, Operations VP and General
Manager, Ana Karina Mendizabal, Financial Manager and Rafael Navajas,
Commercial Manager, and with respect to International and Power, the actual
knowledge of Terry Schramm, Assistant Controller of TECO Guatemala, Inc.

 



40 (f) In addition to the limitations set forth in this Section 10.4 and Section
10.6, with respect to any claim for indemnification regarding any breach of
the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.10 there shall be no
obligation to indemnify any member of the Purchaser Group for any Damages (i)
unless the Damages arise out of (A) a Third Party Claim that is not
intentionally instigated or encouraged by any member of the Purchaser Group,
or (B) a condition discovered in the ordinary course of business, and
then (ii) only to the extent such Damages were incurred to comply with
applicable Environmental Laws using, in the case of any remedial measures
taken by or on behalf of the Purchaser (including the Acquired Entities) after
the Closing, reasonable and recognized remediation protocols and techniques
that are economically reasonable in relation to other reasonable and
recognized remediation protocols and techniques; _provided_ , _however_ , that
there shall be no liability for any such Damages to the extent that any
member of the Purchaser Group or any other Person after Closing contributed to
the condition or circumstance forming the basis of such Damages.

(g) Any Damages for which any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to
indemnification under Section 10.1 shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Damages
constituting a breach of more than one representation and warranty or
covenant.

Section 10.5  _Termination of Indemnification Obligations_.

(a) Each and every representation and warranty of the Seller or the Purchaser
contained in Articles III, IV and V will survive the Closing Date solely for
purposes of Sections 10.1(a) and 10.2(a), as applicable, until (and will
expire and be of no further force or effect after) the eighteen (18)
month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.4, 4.2 and 4.11(c)
shall survive until (and will expire and be of no further force or effect
after) the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date. Each other representation
and warranty made by any party contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement
or contained in or made pursuant to any closing certificate or other
instrument or agreement delivered by any party pursuant to this Agreement
will not survive (and will expire at) the Closing and shall thereafter be of
no further force or effect and no party will have any obligation to provide
indemnification or other liability in respect thereof. 

(b) The obligations of each party to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
applicable Persons (i) pursuant to Sections 10.1(a) and 10.2(a) will
terminate when the applicable representation or warranty expires pursuant to
Section 10.5(a) and (ii) pursuant to Sections 10.1(b) and 10.2(b) will
terminate eighteen (18) months after the date of this Agreement and (iii)
pursuant to Sections 10.1(c), 10.1(d) and 10.2(c) will terminate on the date
that the applicable statute of limitations relating to any Pre-Closing Taxes,
Post-Closing Taxes, or Seller Taxes, as applicable, expire; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that as to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, such obligations to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless will not terminate with respect to any
individual item as to which an Indemnified Party shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice (stating in reasonable detail the

 



41  basis of such claim) to the applicable Indemnifying Party and such
obligation will continue until the resolution of such claim.

 

Section 10.6 _Dollar Limitations_.

(a) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
no event will the aggregate amount for which the Seller collectively shall be
responsible to indemnify the Purchaser Group for all claims under Sections
10.1(a) or 10.1(b) (other than with respect to the Sellers representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.4, 4.2 and 4.11(c)) exceed, and the

(other than with respect to the Sellers representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.4, 4.2 and 4.11(c)) shall be limited to, an amount

sections of the Disclosure Schedule that may require disclosure therein to the
extent its readily apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such
Section or Sections; (ii) the Disclosure Schedule is intended only to qualify
and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller
contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the
scope or effect of any such representations, warranties or covenants; (iii)
the disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule may be over-inclusive, considering
the materiality standard contained in the section of this Agreement relating

matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule are not intended to set or
establish standards of materiality different from those set forth in

item or information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or
greater significance) is material, required to have been disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule, or is of a nature that would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall have
the right from time to time to supplement, modify or update the Disclosure

occurring prior to the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth

in breach of any representation or warranty hereunder and no representation or
warranty of the Seller shall be deemed to be untrue or inaccurate with
respect to the information disclosed in any such Disclosure Schedule Update.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Seller makes a Disclosure
Schedule Update and if the Purchaser determines that the event(s) disclosed in
such Disclosure Schedule Update would be reasonably likely to result in
Damages to the Acquired Entities in excess of U.S.$3,500,000, then the
Purchaser shall have the right exercisable no later than ten (10) Business
Days after such Disclosure Schedule Update is delivered to it to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii).

reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or
Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(i) _Defined Terms_. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the
defined meanings when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein.

(j) _References to a Person_. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

(k) _Negotiation and Drafting of Agreement_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement with
the benefit of legal representation

 



58  and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties
hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement or to the extent to which any such partys counsel participated in
the drafting of any provision hereof or by virtue of the extent to which any
such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof.

in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum
aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price (collectively, the " _Guarantied
Obligations_ "); provided however that Parents obligations under this
Guaranty shall terminate and be of no force or effect after the (i) seven (7)
year anniversary of the Closing Date in connection with Sections 10.1(c) and
10.1(d), _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations will not terminate

as to which the Purchaser shall have, before the expiration of the seven (7)
year anniversary, previously made a claim in writing to the Seller and such
obligations will continue until the resolution thereof or payment by the
Guarantor and (ii) three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date in
connection with all other Guarantied Obligations, provided that such
obligations will not terminate with respect to any Indemnified Claim pursuant
to such other Guarantied Obligations as to which the Purchaser shall have,
before the expiration of the three (3) year anniversary, previously made a

resolution thereof or payment by the Guarantor. If any Guarantied Obligation
is not paid when due or is not otherwise performed or discharged according to
its terms, or upon any breach or default by the Seller of or under this
Agreement or any other agreement entered into by the Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Purchaser shall be entitled to
proceed directly and at once against Parent to enforce such Guarantied
Obligation and/or to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of
such Guarantied Obligation then due, without first proceeding against the
Seller and without joining the Seller in any proceeding against Parent. This
guarantee is an absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment and
performance and not collection and is not in any way conditioned or
contingent upon any attempt to collect from or enforce performance by the
Seller or upon any other event or condition whatsoever. Parent hereby unconditionally waives (i) presentment, promptness, diligence,
acceptance of this Guaranty, protest and any and all notices and (ii) any and
all defenses to the enforceability of the guarantee provided herein.
