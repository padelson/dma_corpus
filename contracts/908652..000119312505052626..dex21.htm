treated as an asset purchase in a manner consistent with such allocation and

which the acquisition of the Shares is treated as an asset purchase or
any related proceeding before any taxing authority. In the event that the
allocation reported to a taxing authority by either party is disputed by such
taxing authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly
notify the other party and keep the other party apprised of material

proceeding, hearing, or investigation with respect to the administration or
the investment of the assets of any Plan which is not a Multiemployer Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of

pocket expenses or costs except those which are timely reimbursed by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.



SECTION 5.9 PERFORMANCE. Each of the Parties shall perform all acts to be
performed by it pursuant to this Agreement and shall refrain from taking or
omitting to take any action that would violate or cause to remain unfilled
its covenants, obligations or agreements or breach its representations and
warranties hereunder or render them inaccurate in any material respect or that
in any way would prevent or materially adversely affect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable
best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions to the
obligations of the other Parties/Party set forth in Section 6.2 and Section
6.3, respectively.



SECTION 5.10 PUBLICITY. Seller and Purchaser shall agree on the form and
content of any initial press releases regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and thereafter shall consult with each other prior to
issuing, provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon and
use all reasonable best efforts to agree upon, any press release or other
public statement with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and shall not issue directly or indirectly any such press release or make
directly or indirectly any such public statement prior to such consultation
and prior to considering in good faith any such comments, except as may be
required by applicable Law or regulation or, with respect to LNY, in
connection with LNY



 

-51- complying with its obligations under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
Nothing in this Section 5.10 shall be deemed to limit, impede or prohibit
Purchaser from exercising its rights under or receiving the benefits of
Section 5.15(a).



SECTION 5.11 CHANGE OF CORPORATE NAME POST-CLOSING. Purchaser agrees that it
shall, and shall cause PFG, as promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date and, in any case, within ninety (90) days of the Closing, take such
actions and make such filings with the applicable Governmental Entities in
order to change the corporate name of PFG to a name that does not include the
word "Poster". 



SECTION 5.12 CERTAIN MATTERS RELATED TO GNL. Purchaser acknowledges that PFG
and GNL are each a party to the GNL Stock Purchase Agreement a current copy of
which is attached to Schedule 5.12. Seller shall not, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), make or consent to any amendment to, or
waive any right that it has under, the GNL Stock Purchase Agreement which
would adversely affect any of the Acquired Entities following the Closing.
Purchaser acknowledges that, in connection with the GNL Stock Purchase
Agreement, PFG and GNLV will enter into a certain Trademark Licensing
Agreement with GNL and that PFG will enter into a certain Transition Services
Agreement with GNL and Barrick; current copies of the form of such agreements
are attached to Schedule 5.12; provided, however, that no amendment to the
Trademark Licensing Agreement or Transition Services Agreement may be made
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed unless such amendment would adversely
affect any of the Acquired Entities following the Closing. In the event that
the GNL Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated or the transactions
contemplated thereby are otherwise abandoned prior to the Closing, GNL shall
thereafter be deemed an Acquired Entity for all purposes under this Agreement.
In the event that the closing occurs under the GNL Stock Purchase Agreement,
PFG shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, apply the net proceeds from
such transaction to pay any amounts due and payable under clause (a) and
clause (b) of the definition of Credit Agreement Repayment Amount.



SECTION 5.13 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - PRE-CLOSING.



(a) None of the Acquired Entities shall, directly or indirectly, do any act or
omit to do any act whereby any registrations of or applications for Acquired
Entities Owned Intellectual Property may lapse, become abandoned, dedicated to
the public, or unenforceable.



 

(b) None of the Acquired Entities shall cease the use of any of the Trademarks
included in the Acquired Entities Owned Intellectual Property or fail to
maintain the level of the quality of products sold and services rendered under
any such Trademark at a level at least substantially consistent with the
quality of such products and services as of the date of this Agreement
and the Acquired Entities shall take or cause to be taken all steps necessary
or appropriate to insure that licensees of such Trademarks use such consistent
standards of quality during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date. 



 

-52- SECTION 5.14 SENIOR NOTES.



(a) At such time as reasonably requested by Purchaser in writing (provided
that it shall coordinate with PFG regarding such timing), PFG shall, subject
to compliance with any applicable provisions of the Indenture, (i) commence a
cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding Senior Notes and/or (ii)
solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes regarding certain
amendments (the "Indenture Amendments") to certain of the covenants contained
in the Indenture. Such offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation
(individually or collectively, the "Debt Offer") shall be made on such terms
and conditions as are reasonably requested by Purchaser and agreed to by PFG
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that, in any event,
the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer shall provide that the
closing thereof shall be contingent upon the Closing. It is expressly
understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not be a condition to Closing
and shall in no event delay or hinder the Closing. PFG shall waive any of the
conditions to the Debt Offer and make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Debt Offer as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and
PFG shall not, without Purchasers prior consent, waive any condition to the
Debt Offer or make any changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer,
in each case except as required by applicable Law and subject to compliance
with any applicable provisions of the Indenture. PFG covenants and agrees,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the receipt of the
necessary funds from LNY pursuant to the immediately following sentence,
including the terms and conditions to the Debt Offer, to accept for payment,
and pay for, the Senior Notes and effect the Indenture Amendments, in each
case contemporaneously with, and contingent upon, the Closing, in each case
except as required by applicable Law and subject to compliance with any
applicable provisions of the Indenture. Without, in any way limiting Section
5.14(d), LNY covenants and agrees to provide the necessary funds to effect
the foregoing sentence. PFG agrees to enter into a customary dealer manager
agreement and a customary information agent agreement with a dealer manager
and information agent, respectively, recommended by Purchaser (and reasonably
acceptable to PFG).



(b) Within ten (10) Business Days following the date of agreement on the terms
of the Debt Offer, PFG shall prepare, subject to the reasonable advice and
comments of Purchaser, an offer to purchase the Senior Notes and forms of the
related letters of transmittal and summary advertisement, appropriate consent
solicitation materials, as well as all other information and exhibits that may
be necessary in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the "Offer
Documents"). In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with this Agreement, PFG shall have the right to amend the Offer Documents
without Purchasers consent, including such amendment as shall terminate the
Debt Offer. All mailings to the holders of Senior Notes in connection with
the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior reasonable review, comment and
approval of Purchaser; provided, however, that the comment and approval of
Purchaser shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. PFG will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be mailed to the
holders of the Senior Notes as promptly as practicable following receipt of
the written request from Purchaser under paragraph (a) above to do so. 



 

-53- (c) PFG agrees to amend the Offer Documents and distribute amended copies
thereof as required by applicable Law.



(d) LNY shall bear all costs and expenses (including costs and expenses of
counsel, accounting and other advisors) of the Debt Offer (including any Taxes
resulting from the Debt Offer), whether or not the Debt Offer is consummated,
and whether or not the Closing occurs, and shall reimburse PFG (or its direct
or indirect stockholders) for any such costs and expenses (including costs and
expenses of counsel, accounting and other advisors) on a timely basis upon
LNYs receipt of reasonable written documentation thereof.



(e) If Purchaser fails to timely perform any of its obligations under this
Section 5.14, LNY shall undertake any and all such obligations of the
Purchaser under this Section 5.14.



SECTION 5.15 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.



(a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be permitted to hold
joint meetings with all employees of each of the Acquired Entities and, to
the extent applicable, any bargaining representatives of such employees,
provide preliminary information relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and thereafter Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct one-on-
one meetings with all employees of each of the Acquired Entities at such
times as Purchaser shall reasonably request and at space provided by each of
the Acquired Entities at the Real Property or at such other location as shall
be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. In connection therewith, each of the
Acquired Entities shall provide Purchaser with access to complete personnel
files of all employees of each of the Acquired Entities subject to any
restrictions or limitations under the Acquired Entities internal policies
and procedures and subject to Gaming Laws, privacy Laws or any other Law, in
each case as applicable. From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall cause GNLV to (to the extent practicable) provide Purchaser with
reasonable space at the Real Property on an as needed basis and at no cost to
Purchaser in order for Purchaser to handle employment and transition related
matters. Purchaser in exercising its rights under this Section 5.15
shall comply with Gaming Laws, privacy Laws and any other Law, in each case,
as applicable.



(b) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts, including providing all
information reasonably necessary and taking all reasonably necessary actions,
to assist Purchaser in transitioning any employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements for the Acquired Entities prior to the Closing Date.



(c) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each Acquired
Entity to honor its obligations under the collective bargaining agreements
listed on Schedule 5.15 (the "CBAs").



(d) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall or shall cause each Acquired Entity to (i) provide each
employee of the Acquired Entities who are not covered by a CBA and who
continue to be employed by an Acquired Entity following the Closing Date



 

-54- (collectively, the "Non-Represented Employees") with base compensation, bonus
opportunity, annual and long-term incentive compensation and severance, in
each case that is substantially similar, in the aggregate, to that which each
of the Non-Represented Employees was eligible to receive immediately prior to
the Closing and (ii) maintain for the Non-Represented Employees "employee
benefit plans" (as defined by ERISA) that are similar, in the aggregate, to
the "employee benefit plans" applicable to such Non-Represented Employees
immediately prior to the Closing. 



(e) In the event that Purchaser or one of the Acquired Entities shall adopt
or maintain any "employee benefit plan" with respect to the Non-Represented
Employees at any time prior to the one year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser or the Acquired Entity, as applicable, shall cause each such plan
to (i) waive all limitations as to any preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage and (ii) recognize
service with the Acquired Entities to the same extent such service had been
recognized by Seller under a similar type of benefit plan immediately prior to
the Closing (except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits).



SECTION 5.16 NON-SOLICITATION OF UNIQUE CUSTOMERS. For purposes of this
Section 5.16, the term "Unique Customers" means customers who are listed on
the Lists of GNLV. From and after the date hereof until the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Entities) shall intentionally engage in any direct or targeted
solicitation of any of the Unique Customers. On the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver or make available to Purchaser a list of the Unique Customers as of
the Closing Date; provided, however, the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller
or any of its Affiliates from soliciting customers by use of advertisements or
the media or other indirect methods of solicitation that are not directly
targeted at any Unique Customers.



SECTION 5.17 JOINT CONTRACTS. Schedule 5.17 sets forth each third
party Material Contract to which both GNLV and GNL are parties (collectively,
the "Joint Contracts"). Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Joint Contracts to be "split-out" prior to Closing (which may
include entering into one or more new separate agreements) so that GNLV is a
party to a contract with the service provider in question only and not
together with GNL and, in connection therewith, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide for a release of GNLV of all Liability or
Losses under the Joint Contract as to services provided to, or the actions by
or on behalf of, GNL; provided that the Purchaser shall provide all reasonable
cooperation to Seller in furtherance of this Section 5.17 as Seller may
reasonably request; provided, further, that for the purposes of this Section
5.17, reasonable best efforts shall not require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to incur or pay any out-of-pocket expenses or costs except those
which are timely reimbursed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Seller in its efforts
to obtain any such "split-out."



SECTION 5.18 TREATMENT OF AFFILIATE CONTRACTS. PFG shall cause its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), on the one hand, and the
Acquired Entities, on the other hand to terminate the Affiliate Contracts with
effect as of the Closing without Liability or Loss to the Acquired Entities,
including the termination of the employment agreements between PFG and each
of Timothy N. Poster and Thomas C. Breitling at or prior to the Closing
without Liability or Loss to the Acquired Entities, except for salary and
accrued benefits (if any) due under such agreements (it being understood the



 

-55- determination of salary and accrued benefits under such agreements shall be
without giving effect to the termination thereof). PFG shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause GNLV to assign or otherwise transfer at no
cost to GNLV, (a) the "Interests" conveyed to it under the two Assignment,
Consent and Exclusive Use Agreements, each effective as of July 1, 2004, by
and between M AND M Ventures III, LLC and GNLV to M AND M Ventures III, LLC
and (b) the "Interests" conveyed to it under the two Assignment, Consent and
Exclusive Use Agreements, each effective as of July 1, 2004, by and between
TB Management, LLC and GNLV to TB Management LLC, at or prior to the Closing
and, if applicable, to provide a release or novation of all obligations of
GNLV or the Acquired Entities for obligations relating to such Interests.



SECTION 5.19 REFUND OF NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT/LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. In
the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser (a) and Purchaser
makes a bona fide, good faith allegation that the Seller Parties have
committed fraud with respect to this Agreement (provided that a judicial
determination of such fraud must be made before the refund entitlement set
forth below vests in Purchaser) or (b) pursuant to Section 9.1(c), if the
Seller Parties (i) have intentionally or willfully failed to perform any of
their obligations required under this Agreement in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) are in breach of their
obligations in Sections 5.1 (Conduct of Business of the Acquired Entities),
5.6 (No Intercompany Accounts), 5.12 (Certain Matters Related to GNL),
5.18 (Treatment of Affiliate Contracts), 5.20 (Capital Expenditures) and 5.23
(Leased Real Property) provided such breach has or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect as to the aforementioned sections
other than Sections 5.6, 5.12 (only as to repayment of amounts under the
Credit Agreement) and 5.18 and such breach by the Seller Parties would
reasonably be expected to have resulted in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(b); provided that in the case of clause
(a) or clause (b) above all other conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied, or are capable of, being satisfied (it being understood that the
action or inaction of the Seller Parties shall be taken into account
in determining whether all other conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied, or are capable of, being satisfied), then solely in the case of
clause (a) or clause (b) above, Purchaser shall be entitled to a refund of the
Non-Refundable Deposit Amount. In such event, Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement, refund to Purchaser the Non-Refundable Deposit Amount in
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser.
Further, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the non-refundable nature
of the Non-Refundable Deposit (in circumstances other than as described above)
is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, in the absence of such agreement, Seller Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement and (B) the damages resulting from the termination of this
Agreement other than as set forth in this Section 5.19 are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that the amount of the Non-Refundable
Deposit is a reasonable forecast of the actual damages which may be incurred
by the Seller Parties. The retention of the Non-Refundable Deposit by Seller
under this Agreement constitutes liquidated damages in full and complete
satisfaction of, and shall be the Seller Parties sole and exclusive remedy
for, any Loss, Liability, damage or claim of the Seller Parties arising out of
or in connection with any termination of this Agreement or the facts
and circumstances resulting in such termination or otherwise related thereto
or otherwise arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. The terms of
this Section 5.19 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.



 

-56- SECTION 5.20 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Acquired Entities may make any of the
capital expenditures set forth in the capital expenditure budget attached as
Schedule 5.20 and, in addition thereto, may make capital expenditures not so
identified in the capital expenditure budget up to an aggregate of $100,000 in
excess of any applicable insurance proceeds; provided that nothing contained
in this Section 5.20 shall prohibit the Acquired Entities from responding to
an emergency situation (it being understood and agreed that Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser of any such emergency and the emergency
expenditures and other actions taken in response thereto). The Acquired
Entities compliance with this Section 5.20 is subject to compliance with the
Gaming Laws.



SECTION 5.21 FUNDING BY LNY. LNY has available on the date of this Agreement,
and will have on the Closing Date, and shall ensure that Purchaser has
available on the Closing Date, all funds necessary to consummate the
acquisition of the Shares and to pay its portion of associated costs and
expenses in connection therewith, including all funds necessary to (a)
if required, pay in full the Credit Agreement Repayment Amount and (b)
satisfy amounts, if any, due to the holders of the Senior Notes that may arise
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in each
case, LNY shall, to the extent any such payment is required, guaranty (and
cause to be performed) Purchasers full and timely payment thereof.



SECTION 5.22 CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION MATTERS. From and after the Closing, LNY
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been
at any time since January 23, 2004 or who becomes prior to the Closing, a
director or officer of any of the Acquired Entities (each a "Covered Person")
from and against all losses, claims, damages, costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses), liabilities, judgments and, subject
to the proviso of this sentence, settlement amounts that are paid or incurred
in connection with any pending, threatened or completed claim, action, suit,
formal or informal proceeding, formal or informal investigation or formal or
informal inquiry (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing) that is (a)
based on, or arises out of, the fact that such Covered Person is or was a
director or officer of any of the Acquired Entities or (b) based on, or
arising out of, or pertaining hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case under clause (a) or clause (b) above, to the fullest extent the
applicable Acquired Entity is permitted under applicable Nevada Law to
indemnify its own directors or officers. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event that any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry is brought against any Covered Person, (A) LNY shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof with legal counsel of LNYs choosing and LNY
shall not be liable to such Covered Person for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any expenses subsequently incurred by such Covered Person in
connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that such Covered
Person may employ counsel of its own choosing, and LNY shall pay such Covered
Person for reasonable legal fees and expenses of such counsel, if under
applicable standards of professional conduct the counsel selected by LNY may
be reasonably determined by counsel consulted by such Covered Person, to have
a material conflict on a significant issue representing the
applicable Acquired Entity and the Covered Person in the conduct of the
defense of an action and (B) LNY shall not be liable for any settlement of any
claim effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any Covered Person wishing to obtain
indemnification under this Section 5.22, upon learning of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, shall promptly notify LNY thereof;
provided, however, the failure of any Covered Person to give such



 

-57- notice shall not waive any rights of the Covered Person under this Section
5.22, except to the extent that the rights of LNY are actually materially
prejudiced thereby. In the event LNY does not assume the defense of an action
in accordance with this Section 5.22, (w) the Covered Persons as a group
seeking indemnification with respect to the same or a substantially related
matter may retain only one (1) law firm with respect to such matter, except to
the extent that under applicable standards of professional conduct, such
counsel would have a material conflict on a significant issue representing
such Covered Person and any other Covered Person or Covered Persons, (x) LNY
shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the disposition
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or inquiry to each
Covered Person promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise
advance to such Covered Person upon request reimbursement of documented
expenses reasonably incurred, (y) LNY shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Covered Persons and all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the Covered Persons in connection with seeking
and obtaining indemnification from LNY, from time to time, in each case within
three (3) Business Days of the receipt by LNY of a statement from
such counsel for the Covered Persons and (z) LNY shall use reasonable best
efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the extent that any Covered Person is, by reason of the fact
that such Covered Person is or was a director or officer of any of the
Acquired Companies, a witness in any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry to which such Covered Person is not a party, such
Covered Person shall be indemnified and held harmless against all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith. LNY shall not enter
into any settlement of any claim in which LNY or any of its Affiliates is
jointly liable with an Covered Person (or would be if joined in such claim)
unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims
asserted against such Covered Person. Neither LNY nor any of its Affiliates
shall take any action so as to amend, modify, limit or repeal the provisions
for indemnification of Covered Persons contained in the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or other comparable organizational documents) of the
Acquired Entities in such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of any
Covered Person to be indemnified by such corporations in respect of their
serving in such capacities prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 5.22, LNY shall in no event be required
under this Section 5.22 to provide indemnification and reimbursement of fees,
costs and expenses to the Covered Persons in an aggregate amount exceeding
$15,000,000.



SECTION 5.23 LEASED REAL PROPERTY. Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the Closing the written consent of each of
the landlords of the Leased Real Property whose consent is required pursuant
to such lease to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that Purchaser shall provide all reasonable cooperation to
the Seller Parties in furtherance of this Section 5.23 as any Seller Party
may reasonably request; provided, further, that for the purposes of this
Section 5.23, reasonable best efforts shall not require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to incur or pay any out-of-pocket expenses or costs except those
which are timely reimbursed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.



SECTION 5.24 FURTHER ACTIONS. In case at any time after the date of this
Agreement and from time to time any further action is necessary to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Purchaser with valid and legal
title, to the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, excepting only the
restrictions on the subsequent transfer of the Shares as may be imposed under
applicable Laws, the Parties shall and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause any of their Affiliates to take or cause to be taken all such necessary
or appropriate action in accordance with and subject to the terms of this



 

-58- Agreement including to execute, deliver and file all such further documents;
provided that Purchaser shall provide all reasonable cooperation to the
Seller Parties in furtherance of this Section 5.24 as any Seller Party may
reasonably request; provided, further, that for the purposes of this Section
5.24, subject to Article VII, reasonable best efforts shall not require the
Parties or their respective Affiliates to incur or pay any out-of-pocket
expenses or costs except those which are timely reimbursed by the other Party
or any Affiliate thereof.



SECTION 5.25 NON-SOLICITATION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. From and after the
date of this Agreement until the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall (a) except with respect to
those individuals set forth on Schedule 5.25, solicit or induce, or attempt to
solicit or induce, any employee of, or independent contractor exclusive to,
the Acquired Entities or Purchaser or any of Purchasers Affiliates engaged in
the business or the casino and gaming activities and operations of GNLV to
leave the Acquired Entities or Purchaser or any of Purchasers Affiliates
engaged in the business or the casino and gaming activities and operations of
GNLV for any reason whatsoever or (b) except with respect to those individuals
set forth on Schedule 5.25, hire, solicit to hire, or in any other manner
interfere with the business relationship between the Acquired Entities or
Purchaser or any of Purchasers Affiliates and any employee or independent
contractor of the Acquired Entities. If any employee (i) is terminated by
Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates with cause under the terms of such
employees employment agreement (or, if no employment agreement has been
executed, under the definition of cause in the last draft employment
agreement offered to such employee by Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliate, if
applicable) or (ii) terminates his or her employment with Purchaser or
Purchasers Affiliates for good reason under the terms of such employees
employment agreement (or, if no employment agreement has been executed, under
the definition of good reason in the last draft employment agreement offered
to such employee by Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliate, if applicable), then
the provisions of this Section 5.25 will not apply with respect to that
employee after a period of six (6) months following such employees
termination of employment with Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliate, as
applicable, nor shall such employee receive compensation or payments from
Seller or any of its Affiliates during or with respect to such six-month
period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Seller and its Affiliates
may conduct general searches for employees or independent contractors by use
of advertisements or the media that are not directly targeted at the
employees or independent contractors of the Acquired Entities, Purchaser or
any of Purchasers Affiliates engaged in the business or the casino and gaming
activities and operations of GNLV.



SECTION 5.26 AMENDMENT AND SUPPLEMENT OF DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE OR SCHEDULES.
The Purchaser agrees that the Seller Parties shall have the ability, with
respect to their representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement, (through the Closing to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedule and Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered, which, if existing or known on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required or permitted to be set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or
on a Schedule. Each Party agrees that, notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, no amendment or supplement to the Disclosure Schedule or a Schedule
that constitutes or reflects an event or occurrence that would have a Material
Adverse Effect (individually or when combined with all prior amendments or
supplements), may be made unless Purchaser consents to such amendment or
supplement, which consent may be withheld in Purchasers sole discretion. For
all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether
the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) have been fulfilled, the Disclosure



 

-59- Schedule and Schedules shall be deemed to be the Disclosure Schedule as
amended or supplemented pursuant to this Section 5.26. The Seller Parties
agree to deliver on or about the tenth day prior to the expected Closing Date,
the Disclosure Schedule and Schedules to the Purchaser supplemented for
matters occurring between the date of this Agreement and the day immediately
prior to the delivery of the supplemented Disclosure Schedule and Schedules.

SECTION 7.2 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. All claims for indemnification by an
Indemnified Party under Section 7.1 shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:



(a) In the event any claim or demand (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of
which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under Section 7.1 is asserted
against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person
other than a Seller Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Party (a "Third
Party"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party; provided that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in giving any such Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any indemnification obligation hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party in writing as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period
whether or not the Indemnifying



 

-62- Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense and by
counsel of its own choosing (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party) to defend against such Third Party Claim; provided,
further, that if, under applicable standards of professional conduct a
material conflict on any significant issue between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party exists in respect of such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one additional counsel
(reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) to be retained in order
to resolve such conflict, promptly upon presentation by the Indemnified Party
of invoices or other documentation evidencing such amounts to be reimbursed.



(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period that it desires to defend against such Third Party Claim, (A)
the Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend and
protect the interests of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party, prior to or during the period in
which the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such matter, may take such
reasonable actions as the Indemnified Party deems necessary to preserve any
and all rights with respect to such matter, without such actions being
construed as a waiver of the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VII, (C) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to any settlement
that (1) does not contain an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
from the subject matter of the settlement, (2) imposes any liabilities or
obligations on the Indemnified Party and (3) with respect to any non-monetary
provision of such settlement, would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Indemnified Party, (D) the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate (during regular business hours) with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof and (E) the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
agreed that it will indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article
VII.



(ii) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
the Dispute Period that it desires to defend against such Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct any such defense
at its sole cost and expense, but, in such case, the Indemnified Party shall
control the investigation and defense and may settle or take any other actions
the Indemnified Party deems reasonably advisable without in any way waiving or
otherwise affecting the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VII.



(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to make available
to each other, their counsel and other representatives, all information and
documents available to them which relate to such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the Acquired Entities and their
respective employees and representatives also agree to render to each other
such assistance and cooperation as may reasonably be required to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of such Third Party Claim.



 

-63- (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event, if the Indemnified Party
desires to participate in any defense of a Third Party Claim it may do so at
its sole cost and expense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control, pay or settle any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party
shall have undertaken to defend so long as the Indemnified Party shall also
waive any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnifying Party.



(b) In the event that an Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.1 which it determines to assert, but
which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send
an Indemnity Notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the Dispute Period during which to notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of any good faith objections it has to the
Indemnified Partys Indemnity Notice, setting forth in reasonable detail each
of the Indemnifying Partys objections thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does
not deliver such written notice of objection within the Dispute Period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility for the
prompt payment of the Indemnified Partys claims for indemnification set forth
in the Indemnity Notice and shall have no further right to contest the
validity of such indemnification claims. If the Indemnifying Party does
deliver such written notice of objection within the Dispute Period, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any such dispute within the Resolution Period and if not resolved
through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section 7.2(c).



(c) Any dispute submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section 7.2(c)
shall be finally and conclusively determined by the decision of a board of
arbitration consisting of three members (hereinafter sometimes called the
"Board of Arbitration") selected as hereinafter provided. Each of
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall select one member and
the third member shall be selected by mutual agreement of the other members,
or if the other members fail to reach agreement on a third member within
twenty (20) days after the selection of the second arbitrator, such third
member shall thereafter be selected by the American Arbitration Association
upon application made to it for a third member possessing expertise or
experience appropriate to the dispute jointly by the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party. The Board of Arbitration shall meet in Las Vegas,
Nevada or such other place as a majority of the members of the Board of
Arbitration determines more appropriate, and shall reach and render a decision
in writing (concurred in by a majority of the members of the Board of
Arbitration) with respect to the amount, if any, which the Indemnifying Party
is required to pay to the Indemnified Party in respect of the Indemnified
Partys claims for indemnification set forth in the Indemnity Notice. In
connection with rendering its decision, the Board of Arbitration shall adopt
and follow such rules and procedures as a majority of the members of the Board
of Arbitration deems necessary or appropriate. To the extent practical,
decisions of the Board of Arbitration shall be rendered no more than thirty
(30) days following commencement of proceedings with respect thereto. The
Board of Arbitration



 

-64- shall cause its written decision to be delivered to the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party. Any decision made by the Board of Arbitration (either
prior to or after the expiration of such thirty day period) shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and
entitled to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Law and entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party to any arbitration shall bear
its own expenses in relation thereto, including but not limited to such
partys attorneys fees, if any, and the expenses and fees of the Board of
Arbitration shall be divided between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in the same proportion as the portion of the related claim
determined by the Board of Arbitration to be payable to the Indemnified
Party bears to the portion of such claim determined not to be so payable.



SECTION 7.3 INDEMNIFICATION BACKSTOP. In the event that Purchaser is required
to provide indemnification to the Seller Indemnified Parties under Section
7.1(b) and Purchaser fails to make due and timely payment with respect
thereto, then within ten (10) days of written notice to LNY and Purchaser by
a Seller Indemnified Party, LNY shall, without duplication, satisfy any such
obligation on behalf of the Purchaser without right of set-off. At or prior to
Closing, the Seller Parties shall cause Timothy N. Poster and Thomas C.
Breitling to enter into an agreement to be effective at Closing, substantially
in the form of Exhibit B hereto. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, any
Indemnified Party must first seek indemnification from the Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, and LNY, on the one hand, and Timothy N. Poster
and Thomas C. Breitling, on the other hand, shall have no obligation pursuant
to this Article VII unless and until the non-occurrence of payment
as described above.



SECTION 7.4 LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, Seller (and Timothy N. Poster and Thomas C. Breitling, if
applicable), on the one hand, and Purchaser (and LNY, if applicable), on the
other hand, shall in no event be required to provide indemnification to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively,
under this Article VII to the extent the amount of Losses paid by, or on
behalf of, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, exceeds, in
the aggregate, an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

SECTION 10.3 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2,
3.3(a), 4.1 and 4.2(a), which shall survive Closing indefinitely, no

SECTION 10.4 INTERPRETATION; CONSTRUCTION. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section or Sections, such reference shall be to a Section
or Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Words used in the singular form in this Agreement shall be deemed
to import the plural, and vice versa, as the sense may require. The phrases
"the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof," and terms of similar import,
unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date
on the cover page of this Agreement. A reference to the male gender shall be
deemed to be a reference to the female gender and vice versa. Whenever the
last day for the exercise of any right or the discharge of any duty under this
Agreement falls on other than a Business Day, the Party having such right or
duty shall have until the next Business Day to exercise such right or
discharge such duty. Unless otherwise indicated, the word "day" shall be
interpreted as a calendar day. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.



SECTION 10.5 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws applicable to contracts made and to be
performed entirely in Nevada, without regard to any applicable conflicts of
Law, except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the Gaming Laws apply.



 

-70- SECTION 10.6 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE; ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT;
REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS. Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada or any court of the State of Nevada located in Clark County in any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and agrees that any such action,
suit or proceeding shall be brought only in such court; provided, however,
that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the purpose referred to
in this Section 10.6 and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to
the jurisdiction of said court or in the State of Nevada other than for such
purpose. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such a
court. Each of the Parties further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead
or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such a court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in either of the above
named courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.



SECTION 10.7 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of each of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall have the right to assign all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement, including the right to enforce all of the
terms of this Agreement to a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
LNY, without the prior written consent of the Seller Parties; provided that
such assignee expressly agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement; provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser
from its obligations hereunder unless the Seller Parties expressly agree in
writing. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective permitted assigns.



SECTION 10.8 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be amended or modified by the
Parties except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by each of the
Parties and (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 10.9.



SECTION 10.9 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors
or similar governing body (may, to the extent legally allowed), (a) extend the
time for or waive the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or
other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the conditions contained
in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of any of the Parties to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on its behalf. The failure of any of the Parties to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.



 

-71- SECTION 10.10 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except for the provisions of (a)
Article VII with respect to the Seller Indemnified Parties and Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and (b) as set forth in Section 5.22, this Agreement is
for the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted assigns and
nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder. All references herein or in a Disclosure Schedule
to the enforceability of agreements with third parties, the existence or non-
existence of third-party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third
parties, or similar matters or statements, are intended only to allocate
rights and risks among the Parties and were not intended to be admissions
against interests, give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be
admissible against any Party by any non-Party, or give rise to any claim or
benefit to any non-Party. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall alter the at will employment
status of any employee of the Acquired Entities.



SECTION 10.11 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, the
Schedules, the Exhibits, the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.



SECTION 10.12 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not effected in any manner materially
adverse to any of the Parties. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.



SECTION 10.13 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, including facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

RESPECT TO ANY COVENANTS WHICH CONTEMPLATE PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING THE
CLOSING, FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES, PURCHASER AND LNY
