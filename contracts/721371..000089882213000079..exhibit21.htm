Merger Consideration, the Per Option Merger Consideration and the Post-Closing
Payments.

  

#### (i) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
mail or will cause to be mailed to each record holder of Certificates a letter
of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates on or within thirty
(30) calendar days following the Closing Date, as applicable, to the
Representative, and instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates and
receiving the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of the
Common Stock evidenced thereby. Upon the surrender of each such Certificate
or a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, as
applicable, and promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay the holder of such Certificate an amount from the Fully-Diluted
Stockholder Proceeds as determined in accordance with _Section 2.10(b)_ , in
consideration therefor, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Common Stock held by the Company or a Subsidiary (including ISG)
or held in the treasury of the Company which shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ ) shall represent solely the right
to receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration (and, if any, the
Post-Closing Payments) relating thereto.

  

#### (ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Representative,
they shall be surrendered and canceled as provided in this _Article II_.

  

#### (iii) Other than under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement
and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, no interest shall accrue
or be paid on the cash payable upon the delivery of Certificates or Letters of
Transmittal. None of the Representative, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to a Common Stockholder,
Optionholder or RSU Holder for any cash or interest thereon delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Common Stockholders,
Optionholders or RSU Holders six (6) months after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of

  

  



  

27

       

  

#### any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of
any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

#### (iv) The Representative will deliver or will cause to be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation copies of all surrendered Certificates
and Letters of Transmittal on the Closing Date. After the Effective Time, any
Common Stockholders will be entitled to look only to the Representative and
any Optionholders and RSU Holders will be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their respective claims for the
consideration set forth in this _Section 2.10_ , without interest thereon, but
will have no greater rights against the Representative or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, than may be accorded to general creditors
thereof under applicable Law.

  

#### (v) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Representative will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such
Certificate to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_ ;
_provided_ , that the Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify the Representative,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made
against the Representative, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  

#### (vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Representative shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement any withholding or stock transfer Taxes and such other
amounts as are required under the Code or any applicable provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law (collectively, the " _Withholding Taxes_ "). To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the respective holder of the Certificate, Option or RSU or other
person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, and the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Representative, as applicable, shall
provide to the respective holder of such Certificate, Option or RSU or other
person written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld. Any amounts so
withheld shall be applied by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Representative, as applicable, to satisfy Withholding Taxes. The Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Representative, as applicable, shall remit any
such amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment to the applicable
Taxing Authority.

  

#### 

  

  



  

28

       

  

  



  

#### (vii) If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a surrendered certificate of Common Stock is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the certificate of Common Stock so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representative that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

  

## 2.11 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

  

### (a) _Pre-Closing Statement_. At least five (5) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a statement, certified by an officer of the Company, consisting of the
Company's good-faith estimates of the following amounts: (i) an estimated
calculation of the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (ii) an
estimated calculation of the Seller Transaction Expenses (specifying which
Seller Transaction Expenses will be paid at the Effective Time and not prior
thereto) (the " _Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses_ "), (iii) an estimated
calculation of the Closing Funded Debt (the "Estimated Closing Funded Debt"),
(iv) an estimated calculation of Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ ") and the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Adjustment, and (v) a calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration.
Parent may submit any objections in writing to the Company until 5:00 PM,
Eastern Standard Time, on the Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing
Date and the Company will cooperate in good-faith with Parent to revise the
draft statement to reflect the mutual agreement of the Company and Parent with
respect to the estimated amounts set forth in the preceding sentence (as so
revised and agreed, the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ "); _provided_ , that if the
Company and Parent cannot reach an agreement with respect to the amounts set
forth in the preceding sentence, the Pre-Closing Statement will reflect the
Company's good-faith estimates with respect to such amounts. The Estimated
Merger Consideration shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this _Section
2.11_ (as adjusted, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Pre-Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting principles,
practices and methodologies set forth in _Exhibit E_ (the " _Applicable
Accounting Principles_ ").

  

### (b) _Closing Statement_. Within seventy-five (75) calendar
days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") consisting of (i) a
calculation of the Closing Cash, (ii) a calculation of Closing Working
Capital, the Closing Working Capital Adjustment and the Conclusive Merger
Consideration, (iii) a calculation of any Seller Transaction Expenses that
were not paid and extinguished pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ , (iv) a
calculation of any Closing Funded Debt that was not paid and extinguished
pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ , and (v) a

  

  



  

29

       

  

  



  

### calculation of the amount, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.11(i)_.
The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles.

  

### (c) _Dispute Notice_. The Closing Statement shall become
final, binding and conclusive upon Parent and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
on the forty-fifth (45th) calendar day following the Representative's receipt
of the Closing Statement, unless prior to such forty-fifth (45th) calendar day
the Representative delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_
") stating that the Representative believes the Closing Statement contains
mathematical errors or was not prepared in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles and specifying in reasonable detail each item that the
Representative disputes (each, a " _Disputed Item_ "), and to the extent the
Representative is reasonably able to so specify, the amount in dispute for
each Disputed Item and the reasons supporting the Representative's positions.
The Representative shall not challenge the Closing Statement on any other
basis, and the Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other
items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.11(b)_.

  

### (d) _Resolution Period_. If the Representative delivers a
Dispute Notice and, within ten (10) Business Days following the receipt by
Parent of such Dispute Notice, Parent delivers to the Representative notice of
any disagreement with respect to all or any of the Disputed Items specified in
such Dispute Notice, then the Representative and Parent shall seek in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Items during the fifteen (15) Business Day
period beginning on the date the Representatives receives the notice of
disagreement specified in the preceding sentence (such period, the "
_Resolution Period_ "). If the Representative and Parent reach agreement with
respect to any Disputed Items, Parent shall revise the Closing Statement to
reflect such agreement.

  

### (e) _Independent Accountant_. If the Representative and
Parent are unable to resolve all of the Disputed Items during the Resolution
Period, then the Representative and Parent shall jointly engage and submit the
unresolved Disputed Items (the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to the Independent
Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall act as an arbitrator to
determine, based solely on presentations by the Representative and Parent and
not by independent review, only the Unresolved Items still in dispute and
shall be limited to those adjustments, if any, required to be made for the
Closing Statement to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The
parties shall agree, promptly after the Independent Accountant has been
appointed, on procedures governing the resolution of any dispute by the
Independent Accountant, _provided_ that if the parties fail to agree on such
procedures, the dispute resolution procedures determined by the Independent
Accountant shall govern. The Representative and Parent shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue its
written determination regarding the Unresolved Items within thirty (30)
calendar days after such items are submitted for review. The Independent
Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the Unresolved Items
only and in a manner consistent with this _Section 2.11_ and the

  

  



  

30

       

  

  



  

Applicable Accounting Principles, and in no event shall the Independent
Accountant's determination of the Unresolved Items be for an amount that is
outside the range of Parent's and the Representative's disagreement. Each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Independent
Accountant such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to
the Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant may reasonably request.
The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Representative and Parent absent manifest error, and
Parent shall revise the Closing Statement to reflect such determination upon
receipt thereof. The fees, expenses and costs of the Independent Accountant
shall be borne equally by Parent and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, with the
portion to be borne by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders being paid solely out of
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account.

  

### (f) _Access to Information_. From and after the delivery
of the Company's initial draft of the Pre-Closing Statement, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide promptly to the other party all
information and reasonable access to employees as such other party shall
reasonably request in connection with review of the Pre-Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement, the Dispute Notice or any notice of disagreement under
_Section 2.11(d)_ , as the case may be, including all work papers of the
accountants who audited, compiled or reviewed such statements or notices
(subject to the Representative and its representatives entering into any
undertakings required by Parent's accountants in connection herewith), and
shall otherwise cooperate in good faith with such other party to arrive at a
final determination of the Closing Statement.

  

### (g) _Conclusive Merger Consideration_. The calculation of
Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital, any Seller Transaction Expenses that
were not paid and extinguished pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ (or otherwise not

extinguished pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ (or otherwise not paid or
extinguished prior to the date of determination of the Conclusive Merger
Consideration), as agreed to between the Representative and Parent (or, in the
case of determination of such amounts by the Independent Accountant pursuant
to _Section 2.11(e)_ , as determined by the Independent Accountant) shall be
the " _Final Closing Cash_ " the " _Final Closing Working Capital_ ," the "
_Final Unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses_ " and the " _Final Unpaid Closing
Funded Debt_ ," respectively. The " _Conclusive Merger Consideration_ " shall
be an amount in cash equal to:

  

#### (i) the Estimated Merger Consideration;

  

#### (ii) _increased_ (if the Closing Working Capital Adjustment
as determined in accordance with this _Section 2.11(g)(ii)_ is greater than
zero) or decreased (if the Closing Working Capital Adjustment as determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.11(g)(ii)_ is less than zero) by the absolute
value of

  

  



  

31

       

  

  



  

 the amount (such amount determined by the sum of (A) and (B) below, the " _Closing Working Capital Adjustment_ ") equal to the sum of:

  

###### (A) the difference between Final Closing Working Capital
and Target Closing Working Capital, expressed as (1) a positive number if
Final Closing Working Capital is more than $4,000,000 greater than Target

Conclusive Merger Consideration is more than the Estimated Merger
Consideration or (ii) the " _Excess Amount_ " if the Conclusive Merger
Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Excess Amount be greater than an amount
equal to the sum of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and the

Options) of the Additional Merger Consideration and of the balance of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and to each RSU Holder its applicable
Ownership Percentage (in respect of such RSU Holder's RSUs) of the Additional
Merger Consideration and of the balance of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount.

  

#### (ii) If there is an Excess Amount determined to be due in
accordance with this _Section 2.11_ , then, within two (2) Business Days after
the Conclusive Date, the parties shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to: (A) in the event the Excess Amount is equal to or less

33

    

  

      



      

 

#### wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent, an amount in cash equal to the difference between the Excess Amount
and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount. In the case of clause (A) of
the prior sentence, upon receipt of any such amounts from the Escrow Agent
and subject to _Section 2.10(d)(vi)_ , the Representative shall promptly pay

adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to such party, (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business in
any particular manner if such conduct or agreement with respect thereto would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to such party, (C) agree to any order, action or regulatory
condition of any regulatory body, whether in an approval proceeding or another
regulatory proceeding, that, if effected, would cause a material reduction in
the expected benefits to Parent of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated this Agreement or (D) to litigate before any Governmental
Authority (any of the foregoing effects, a " _Burdensome Effect_ "). In the
event that any action or proceeding is threatened or instituted challenging
the Merger as violative of any Law, Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to avoid or resolve such action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party shall be required to take any action that
constitutes a Burdensome Effect. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

  

## 5.5 _Maintenance of Insurance_. The Company and the
Subsidiaries will continue to carry their existing insurance through the
Closing, and shall not allow any material breach, default or cancellation
(other than expiration and replacement of policies in the ordinary cause of
business consistent with past practice) by the Company or the Subsidiaries of
such insurance policies or agreements that are material to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to occur or exist without the consent of
Parent.

## 5.6 _Supplemental Information_. From time to time prior to
the Closing, the Company will promptly disclose in writing to Parent any
matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed to Parent or which
would render inaccurate or misleading any of the representations, warranties
or statements set forth in _Article III_ hereof in any material respect. No
information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made in this
Agreement.

  

## 5.7 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access and
Cooperation; Litigation Support_.

  

### (a) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date or
such other period (if longer) required by applicable Law, the Surviving
Corporation shall preserve and retain all corporate, accounting, legal,
auditing, human resources and other books and records of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries (including any documents relating to any
governmental or non-governmental Litigation) relating to the conduct of the
business and operations of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the policies of Parent with
respect to document preservation and retention; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall preserve and retain all such books, records
and documents related to any matters that are the subject of a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ until the final resolution of such
claim. For purposes of this _Section 5.7_ , the term "Subsidiaries" shall
include ISG.

  

### (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, after the
Closing Date, afford promptly to the Representative reasonable access during
normal business hours to the offices, facilities, books, records, officers and
employees of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to the extent
reasonably requested by the Representative in connection with any tax-
reporting matters, including on behalf of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder,
_provided_ that such access shall not obligate the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary to take any actions that would unreasonably disrupt the normal
course of their businesses or any applicable Law.

  

## 5.8 _Employees and Benefits_.

  

### (a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and
continuing until December 31, 2013 except as provided in _Section 5.8(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to, provide all persons who are employed by
the Company and the Subsidiaries (including ISG) as of the Closing Date
(including those on temporary layoffs or approved leaves of absence) ("
_Continuing Employees_ "), with the salary, annual bonus opportunity and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable to, in the aggregate, the
salary, annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits being provided to each
such Continuing Employee immediately before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries from amending or

  

  



  

70

       

  

  



  

terminating any plan, program or arrangement, transitioning Continuing
Employees to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent, or
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, and; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Benefit Plan.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume (or, by
virtue of the Merger, be deemed to have assumed) all liabilities and
obligations of the Company with respect to any employment agreements in
accordance with their terms, other than any employment agreement that
terminates in connection with the Merger pursuant to the terms of any new
employment arrangement or offer letter entered into between Parent and a
Continuing Employee.

  

### (b) In any termination or layoff of any Continuing Employee
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will comply fully, if applicable, with the WARN Act and
all other applicable foreign, federal, state and local Laws, including those
prohibiting discrimination and requiring notice to employees. From the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date this
Agreement is terminated, at the request of Parent, which shall not occur more
frequently than on a bi-weekly basis, the Company shall provide to Parent
within seven (7) calendar days of Parent's request a written schedule that
reflects (i) the number of employees of the Company who have experienced
during such period an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) and (ii)
the title, position and employment of each such employee of the Company.
Parent shall use its best efforts not, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries (including ISG) to use their respective best
efforts not, at any time prior to sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing
Date, to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are
defined in the WARN Act, affecting in whole or in part any facility, site of
employment, operating unit or employee of the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries (including ISG) without complying fully with the requirements of
the WARN Act. Parent and Surviving Corporation will bear the cost of
compliance with (or failure to comply with) any such Laws.

  

### (c) For periods on and after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall continue to have all
obligations and liabilities under and with respect to the Benefit Plans and to
or with respect to all persons entitled to benefits under the provisions of
each such Benefit Plan in accordance with their terms.

  

### (d) This _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in
this _Section 5.8_ , express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 5.8_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this
_Section 5.8_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current
or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any
other matter.

  

##

  

  



  

71

       

  

  



  

## 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger
Sub will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements or disclosures with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the terms hereof, and no party
shall, without the prior written consent of the other parties (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any such
press release or make any such public statement, except as may be required by
applicable Law.

  

## 5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

### (a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present officers and directors of the Company and of the
Subsidiaries to the same extent such persons are currently indemnified by the
Company and the Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company's and the Subsidiaries'
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and for such period of time
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Corporation's or a Subsidiary's Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of present and former officers and directors as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) as required by
applicable Law or (ii) unless the provisions as so amended, repealed or
modified in connection with a restructuring in which the governing documents
of the Surviving Corporation include substantially equivalent exculpation or
indemnification provisions with respect to such acts or conduct for the
benefit of such persons ( _provided_ that the officers and directors of the
Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled for such six-year
period to exculpation and indemnification under such provisions of the
Company's and the Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents as in effect on the
date hereof with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time).

  

### (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Closing Date
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Company's and the Subsidiaries' directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time ("D _and O Insurance_") on terms not less favorable than such
existing insurance coverage; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries shall not be required, and Parent shall not be required to cause
the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries, to pay for the DandO Insurance
in an annual amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid as of the date hereof by the Company and the
Subsidiaries for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary

  

  



  

72

       

  

  



  

in this Agreement, the Company and the Subsidiaries may, and at Parent's
request shall, prior to the Effective Time and at Parent's expense, purchase
run-off directors' and officers' liability insurance; _provided_ that payment
for such insurance coverage provided by such run-off directors' and officers'
insurance policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid as of the date hereof by the Company and the
Subsidiaries for such insurance. If the cost of such run-off insurance would
require an expenditure that exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Any such "tail" directors' and officers' insurance and indemnification policy
will satisfy Parent's obligation under this _Section 5.10(b)_ to provide DandO
Insurance; _provided_ that in the event that any claim is brought under such
DandO Insurance, the policy shall be maintained until final disposition thereof.

  

### (c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each
case, the successors and assigns of Parent or the Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, shall expressly assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.10_.

  

## 5.11 _Tax Matters_.

  

### (a) _Tax Cooperation_. The Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the
Representative, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate fully
with each other in connection with (i) the preparation and filing of any U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Returns that include the business and
operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries and (ii) any audit or
examination by any Taxing Authority of the Tax Returns referred to in clause
(i). Such cooperation shall include the furnishing or making available of
employees on a mutually convenient basis and records, books of account or
other materials of the Company and the Subsidiaries necessary or helpful for
the defense against assertions of any Taxing Authority as to any Tax Returns
referred to in clause (i) above.

  

### (b) _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local and foreign
transfer, excise, sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, recording,
property and similar Taxes or fees (other than Withholding Taxes) imposed on
the Merger (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by
each of Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders).

  

## 5.12 _Seller Transaction Expenses_. Following the application of
the Estimated Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.10(b)_ ,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of the Subsidiaries shall have any
Liabilities in respect of any Seller Transaction Expenses. If any Person
shall make a claim for payment of Seller Transaction Expenses (other than in
respect of Final Unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses)

  

  



  

73

       

  

  



  

after the Effective Time, the Representative on behalf of the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders, shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for, from and against any such claim, including any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith.

  

## 5.13 _Section 280G Stockholder Approval_. If it is reasonably
expected that, absent the vote described below, there would be an imposition
of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to, reasonably in advance of the Closing Date, deliver to its
stockholders a disclosure statement in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, which satisfies the Company's disclosure obligations under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and which solicits
and recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the transactions
disclosed therein through a vote meeting the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and shall not make
any such payments or provide any such benefits that are not so approved. The
Company shall provide Parent and its representatives with a copy of such
disclosure statement within a reasonable time prior to delivery to the
Company's stockholders for Parent's approval, with such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

## 5.14 _Section 338 Election_. Parent shall not make any election
under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the acquisition of the Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement.

  

## 5.15 _Termination of Affiliate Agreements_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
terminate, or otherwise amend to exclude the Company and any Subsidiary as a
party thereto, all Affiliate Agreements other than those Affiliate Agreements
set forth on _Section 5.15_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

## 5.16 _Appraisal Notice_. The Company shall cooperate with Parent
to prepare and mail an appraisal notice pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to

the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, at Parent's sole expense, provide all
cooperation that is reasonably necessary or customary and reasonably requested
by Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of bank financing and/or bond
offerings for the purpose of financing the Merger, the fees and expenses
incurred in connection therewith

  

  



  

74

       

  

  



  

and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Debt Financing_ "),
including assisting with the preparation of materials for presentations,
memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the
Company's and the Subsidiaries' respective businesses, (B) require the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives to pay any
fees or expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities
prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent any such fee or expense is
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or Parent has advanced the
amount of such fees, expenses or liabilities to the Company or the
Subsidiaries), and (C) require the preparation or delivery of (i) financial

Company or the Subsidiaries (including those of their respective Company
Representatives) in connection with the cooperation required by this _Section
5.17_.

  

### (c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the

hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining
financing in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

their respective Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns of each such
Person (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled
to indemnification for any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any of them,
directly or indirectly, as a result of, relating to or arising out of:

  

##### (a) the failure of any of the representations or warranties
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement to be true and correct as of
the Effective Time (except for those representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a particular date, which need only be true and
correct as of such date), and

  

##### (b) any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
respective covenants or agreements contained herein which are to be performed
by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, at or before the Effective Time.

  

 _provided_ , that the aggregate amount of Losses with respect to which all
Seller Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 9.3_ shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

  

##

  

  



  

80

       

  

  



  

## 9.4 _Claims_.

  

### (a) Any Person seeking indemnification under _Sections 9.2_
or _9.3_ (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give the party from
whom indemnification is being sought (such notified party, the " _Responsible
Party_ ") notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified
Party has determined has given or reasonably expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification hereunder, stating:

  

#### (i) that the Indemnified Party believes it has incurred,
or will incur, liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party believes
it is or will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
including a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such right of indemnification is claimed or arises (it being agreed that the
failure to specify any provision of this Agreement in such Claim Notice shall
not preclude the Indemnified Party from asserting that there has been a breach
of, or inaccuracy in, or failure to perform such provision); and

  

#### (ii) specify in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of the claim
including, to the extent known and reasonably estimable, each individual item
of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid (if
paid), the basis for any anticipated Liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or agreement or
claim to which each such item is related and the computation of the amount to
which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder;

  

 _provided_ , that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

  

### (b) If the Responsible Party has disputed a claim for
indemnification under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3 _ (including any Third Party
Claim), the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. In the event that the
Responsible Party shall object to the indemnification sought by an Indemnified
Party from the Responsible Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim
(which is addressed in _Section 9.4(c)_ below) as set forth in a Claim Notice,
the Responsible Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice a notice that the Responsible
Party disputes such claim (such notice, the " _Indemnification Dispute Notice_
") and the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty
(60) day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of
such Indemnification Dispute Notice, attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims to which
the Responsible Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and
the Responsible Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective
rights with

  

  



  

81

       

  

  



  

respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party
shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum of agreement setting forth such
agreement. If the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve
such dispute in sixty (60) days after delivery of the Indemnification Dispute
Notice, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the terms of _Sections
10.6_ , _10.11 _ and _10.12_.

  

### (c) If a claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
is made against any Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends
to seek indemnity with respect thereto under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ , such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Responsible Party of such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Other than in connection
with a Third Party Claim by a Governmental Authority (including any Taxing
Authority), the Responsible Party shall have fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the
Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided, that the
Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Indemnified Party). So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting
any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle
any such claim. In any case where the Representative is acting on behalf of
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in connection with a Third Party Claim, all
expenses incurred by the Representative in the defense or settlement of such
Third Party Claim shall be paid using funds from the Indemnification Escrow
Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such claim; provided, that in such event it shall
waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party or from the
Indemnification Escrow Account, as the case may be, for such claim unless the
Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement. If the
Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of a claim
of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
claim, _provided _ that (i) the Indemnified Party shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the
Responsible Party shall not be deemed to have waived any right to assert that
the Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant to
this Agreement. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of
the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that (w) does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting
such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all
Liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment, (x)
does not involve only the payment of money damages, (y) imposes an injunction
or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or (z) includes any
admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the

  

  



  

82

       

  

  



  

Indemnified Party. In connection with a Third Party Claim by a Governmental
Authority (including any Taxing Authority), the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to assume the conduct and control of the settlement or defense
thereof, _provided_ that (1) the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Responsible Party to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel
chosen by such Responsible Party and (2) the Responsible Party shall not have
any liability for any Losses arising out of or in connection with such Third
Party Claim if such Third Party Claim is settled, adjusted or compromised by
the Indemnified Party without the consent of the Responsible Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

### (d) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable
respects with the Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation,
trial and defense of any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include
access during normal business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its
agents and representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified
Party of, records and information which have been identified by the
Responsible Party as being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
The parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers.

  

## 9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights
of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article IX_ are subject to the following limitations:

  

##### (a) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this
_Article IX_ : (i) the amount of any Loss will be determined on an After-Tax
Basis, (ii) all Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds that
have already been paid at the time the amount of such Losses are determined
and (iii) in no event shall an Indemnifying Party have liability to the
Indemnified Party for any consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages, lost profits, diminution in value or similar items, except if and to
the extent any such damages are recovered against an Indemnified Party
pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

  

##### (b) None of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover for any particular Loss pursuant to _Sections _ _9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_
unless such Loss (or series of related Losses) equals or exceeds $50,000
(each, a " _Qualifying Loss_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation
shall not apply to Losses in respect of claims for breaches of any Fundamental
Representation.

  

##### (c) None of the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover Qualifying Losses pursuant to
_Sections 9.2(a)_ 

  

  



  

83

       

  

  



  

or _9.3(a)_ (as applicable) until the total amount of Qualifying Losses which
the Parent Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively,
would recover under _Sections 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ , but for this _Section
9.5(c)_ , exceeds $10,350,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon the Parent
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively, shall be
entitled to indemnification only for such Qualifying Losses in excess of the
Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to
Losses in respect of claims for breach of any Fundamental Representation.

  

##### (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 9.5 _ shall limit any Person's rights to
recovery in respect of fraud or willful misconduct.

  

##### (e) For all purposes of this _Article IX_ , any inaccuracy
or breach of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
(other than the Company's representations and warranties in the first sentence
of _Section 3.6(a)_ , _Section 3.7(a)_ , the first sentence of _Section 3.8_ ,
and _Sections 3.9(a)_ and _3.14_ , shall be determined without reference to
the terms "material," "materially," "Material Adverse Effect," "material
adverse effect" or other similar qualifications as to materiality contained or
incorporated directly or indirectly in any such representation or warranty.

  

##### (f) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses
subject to indemnification under _Section 9.2_ , the amount of such Losses
will be determined net of all liabilities that are (i) properly accrued, (ii)
specifically accrued for the matter subject to indemnification and (iii)
reflected in the Final Closing Working Capital.

  

##### (g) Any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Responsible
Party determined to be covered, in whole or in part, by Third Party Insurance
coverage of the Company as of the date hereof and any DandO "tail" coverage
pursuant to _Section 5.10_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Responsible Party (a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the
Responsible Party so requests within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days
after receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum amount of insurance
proceeds thereunder, in which event all such proceeds actually received, net
of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking such
collection, shall be considered "Eligible Insurance Proceeds". Any amount
payable by a Responsible Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be paid
promptly and payment shall not be delayed pending any determination of
Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers
from a third Person any Eligible Insurance Proceeds and/or any other amount in
respect of any Losses for which a Responsible Party has actually reimbursed
such Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ , such

  

  



  

84

       

  

  



  

Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Responsible Party such
Eligible Insurance Proceeds and/or the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the
Responsible Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim and (ii) any amount expended by the Responsible Party in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter.

  

##### (h) Any Indemnified Party shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses incurred by such party upon and after
becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any indemnification rights hereunder.

  

##### (i) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from a
Responsible Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_
and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses
from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying
claim asserted against the Responsible Party, the Indemnified Party shall
assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Responsible Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

  

## 9.6 _Indemnification Payments and Indemnification Escrow_.

  

### (a) Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Notice to
which a Responsible Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of such Claim Notice (other than a Third Party Claim,
which is addressed in _Section 9.4(c)_ ), claims for Losses covered by a
memorandum of agreement of the nature described in _Section 9.4(b)_ , and
claims for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of
judicial determination as described in _Section 9.4(b)_ and _Section 10.8_
hereof or shall have been settled as described in _Section 9.4(c)_ are
hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_ ". Within ten
(10) Business Days of the determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim (or
at such other time as the Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party shall
agree), the Responsible Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party (except in
the case where a payment has been already effected pursuant to the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement) an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts
designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the Responsible Party not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to such payment. Amounts to be paid to
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be paid solely from the Indemnification
Escrow Account pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the terms
hereof.

  

### (b) On the Survival Termination Date, Parent and the
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction, pursuant to the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from
the Indemnification Escrow Account to the

  

  



  

85

       

  

  



  

Representative and Surviving Corporation by wire transfer of immediately
available funds all or a portion of the cash held in the Indemnification
Escrow Account, such that, following such transfer, the amount of cash
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account equals only the amount, if
any, of claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ properly asserted prior
to such date by the Parent Indemnified Parties in writing in accordance with
this _Article IX_ , but not yet resolved as of the Survival Termination Date
(such claims, " _Unresolved Claims_ ," and such portion of cash to be
transferred, the " _Indemnification Escrow Remainder_ "). The Escrow Agent
shall release (x) to the Representative, an amount in cash equal to the Common
Stockholders' aggregate Ownership Percentage (in respect of such Common
Stockholders' Common Stock) of the Indemnification Escrow Remainder and (y) to
the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to the remainder portion of
the Indemnification Escrow Remainder. Upon receipt of the foregoing amounts
from the Escrow Agent and subject to _Section 2.10(d)(vi)_, the
Representative shall promptly pay to each Common Stockholder its applicable
Ownership Percentage (in respect of such Common Stockholder's Common Stock) of
the Indemnification Escrow Remainder, and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly pay to each Optionholder its applicable Ownership Percentage (in
respect of such Optionholder's Options) of the Indemnification Escrow
Remainder and to each RSU Holder its applicable Ownership Percentage (in
respect of such RSU Holder's RSUs) of the Indemnification Escrow Remainder.
Upon final resolution of any Unresolved Claim in respect of which an amount
had been retained (to the extent not utilized to satisfy valid claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2_ ), Parent and the Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction, pursuant to the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, to the Escrow Agent to deliver such amount promptly from the
Indemnification Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds
and such amount shall be paid to each Common Stockholder, each Optionholder
and each RSU Holding in accordance with the process set forth in the preceding
sentence and the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

  

### (c) Promptly upon any Person becoming entitled to release
of amounts from the Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to this _Article
IX_ or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, Parent and the Representative
shall provide joint written instructions, pursuant to the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to so
release such amounts; _provided_ that the Representative may issue a
unilateral instruction for release of amounts in respect of expenses incurred
by the Representative in the defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim
pursuant to _Section 9.4(c)_.

  

## 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Anything to the contrary in this
Agreement notwithstanding, the parties hereby agree that, in addition to any
remedy available pursuant to Section 8.4, following the Closing, absent fraud
or intentional misrepresentation, the sole and exclusive remedy of a party for
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement (or

  

  



  

86

       

  

  



  

any other claims relating to this Agreement and the other documents,
certificates or agreements delivered pursuant to this Agreement) shall be the
indemnification rights set forth in this _Article IX_.

  

## 9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The parties hereto
agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law.

## 10.14 _Seller Disclosure Letter_. Disclosure in any section of the
Seller Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the indicated Section of this
Agreement, except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to another Section of this
Agreement. The inclusion of information in the Seller Disclosure Letter shall
not be construed as an admission that such information is material

  

  



  

92

       

  

  



  

to any of the Company or the Subsidiaries. In addition, matters reflected in
the Seller Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required
by this Agreement to be reflected in the Seller Disclosure Letter. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the
specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Seller Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher
or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and shall not be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Seller Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such
item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary

representation, warranty or covenant), and shall not be construed as an
admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or
controversy.

  

## 10.15 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

## 10.16 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed
as mutually chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.

  

## 10.17 _Provision Respecting Representation of Company_. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of

Representative, Fully-Diluted Stockholders and their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and
the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the

  

  



  

93

       

  

  



  

negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Debevoise and Plimpton LLP
may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, notwithstanding such
representation or any continued representation of the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation.

  

## 10.18 _Representative_.

  

### (a) The parties have agreed that it is desirable to
designate a representative to act on behalf of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
for certain limited purposes, as specified herein. The parties have
designated Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, LLC as the initial Representative, and
the Stockholder Consent and the executed Letters of Transmittal will expressly
ratify and approve such designation.

  

### (b) The Company hereby agrees that Parent and the Escrow
Agent shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of
the Representative as to the settlement of any claims against the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount pursuant to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Agreement, to the settlement of any claims against the Indemnification
Escrow Amount pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or as to any
actions required or permitted to be taken by the Representative hereunder,
under the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement or under the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

  

### (c) Upon written instruction to the Escrow Agent, all out-
of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors'
fees and expenses, if applicable) reasonably incurred by the Representative in
performing any actions under this Agreement (including in connection with the
determination of the Conclusive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.11_ , the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement and any Transfer Taxes paid by the Representative pursuant to
_Section 5.11(b)_ ), will be paid out of the Representative Escrow Account
from time to time, as and when such fees and expenses are incurred and at the
Representative's sole discretion. In addition, the Representative shall have
the right to recover any of such fees and expenses from the Indemnification
Escrow Account from any amount that would otherwise be distributed to the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders and, prior to any such distribution, shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth such fees and expenses
actually incurred. The Representative shall establish with the Escrow Agent
such terms and procedures for administering, investing and disbursing any
amounts from the Representative Escrow Amount as it may determine in its

  

  



  

94

       

  

  



  

reasonable judgment to be necessary, advisable or desirable to give effect to
the provisions of this Agreement. If any balance of the Representative Escrow
Amount remains undisbursed at such time as all disputes, claims and other
matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Representative Escrow
Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to be delivered pursuant
hereto have been finally resolved, then (i) the Representative shall provide a
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the
Representative Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the Representative an amount in cash equal to the Common Stockholders'
aggregate Ownership Percentage (in respect of such Common Stockholders' Common
Stock) of the balance of the Representative Escrow Account and to the
Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to the remainder balance of the
Representative Escrow Account, and (ii) upon receipt of any such amounts from
the Escrow Agent, (A) the Representative shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid to each Common Stockholder its applicable Ownership Percentage (in
respect of such Common Stockholder's Common Stock) of the balance of the
Representative Escrow Account, and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly
pay to each Optionholder its applicable Ownership Percentage (in respect of
such Optionholder's Options) of the balance of the Representative Escrow
Account and to each RSU Holder its applicable Ownership Percentage (in respect
of such RSU Holder's RSUs) of the balance of the Representative Escrow Amount.

  

### (d) Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges
and agrees that the Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to
perform certain administrative functions in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, each of the Company,
Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Representative shall
have no liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any of the
Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with
any obligations of the Representative under this Agreement or otherwise in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to
the extent such Losses shall be proven to be the direct result of fraud or
willful misconduct by the Representative in connection with the performance of
its obligations hereunder.

  

### (e) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted
to the Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

  

### (f) The Representative hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

#### (i) The Representative has been duly formed and is
validly existing as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Representative has all requisite power and authority to execute
and deliver this

  

  



  

95

       

  

  



  

Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Agreement.

  

#### (ii) The execution and delivery by the Representative of
this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Agreement and the performance by the Representative of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder do not and will not conflict with or
violate any provision of any applicable law, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Authority applicable to, or the organizational documents of, the
Representative.

  

#### (iii) Except (A) for filings under _Section 2.3_ , (B) for
filings under the HSR Act, and (C) as set forth in _Section 3.3_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, no notice to, filing with, or authorization, registration,
consent or approval of any Governmental Authority is necessary for the
Representative's execution of this Agreement or the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or its consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

## 10.19 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Parent Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself
and its heirs, legal representatives, successors, assigns and controlled
Affiliates, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, each of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, the
Representative, and each of their respective Affiliates, and each of the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders', Representative's and such Affiliates' respective

and against any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages,
judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description
whatsoever (collectively, " _Claims_ ") which such Parent Releasor or its
heirs, legal representatives, successors, assigns or controlled Affiliates
ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever prior to the Effective Time resulting or arising from or relating
to the Seller Releasee's status as a direct or indirect stockholder of the
Company, in connection with the direct or indirect investment in the Company
or, to the extent applicable, in their capacity as a director, officer, agent
or service provider of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Parent Releasor and its respective heirs, legal representatives, successors,
assigns and controlled Affiliates retain, and do not release, their rights and
interests (x) under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
(y) with respect to any Claim or Liability solely to the extent resulting from
a Seller Releasee's fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal act or
