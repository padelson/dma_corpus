adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a Subsidiary of Parent (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section
251 of the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in
its entirety in the form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall provide that the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be AV Homes, Inc., the provisions of the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub relating to the incorporator of
Merger Sub shall be omitted and such changes shall be made to comply with
_Section 5.8_), and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law. In addition, subject to _Section 5.8_, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action such
that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

 



-2- (c) At the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, or such other individuals designated by Parent as
of the Effective Time, shall become the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective Time, in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the
Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third
(3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the
offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New
York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that are by
their nature to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur instead on
(a) the earlier to occur of (i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period,
which date must be specified by Parent to the Company in writing not later
than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to
such date, and (ii) the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the
final day of the Marketing Period (as it may be extended pursuant to the
definition of "Marketing Period"); or (b) such other date and time as agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable
on the Closing Date, or such other date and time to which Merger Sub and the
Company may agree in writing, Merger Sub or the Company shall cause
a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and
time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



-3- ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to _Section 2.1(c)_, each Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than any Company Restricted Stock Award, any Dissenting Share and any
Cancelled Share, shall be converted into the right to receive (i) in the case
of a Company Share with respect to which an election to receive Parent Shares
(a " _Stock Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to _Section 2.8_ (each, a " _Stock Electing Share_ "), 0.9793
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, the " _Stock Election Consideration_ "); (ii)
in the case of a Company Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to _Section 2.8_ (each, a " _Cash Electing Share_ "), $21.50 in
cash, without interest (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, the " _Cash
Election Consideration_ "); or (iii) in the case of a Company Share with
respect to which an election to receive a mix of Parent Shares and cash (a "
_Mixed Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked pursuant to 
_Section 2.8_, or with respect to which no election has been made (each, a "
_Mixed Consideration Share_ "), $12.64 in cash, without interest, and 0.4034
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (the " _Mixed
Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the $12.64 in cash, without
interest, the " _Mixed Election Consideration_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.7_,
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, if any, into which such Company
Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the "
_Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ (the " _Dividend Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



-4- (c) _Proration_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the Stock Election Consideration and the Cash Election
Consideration shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this _Section
2.1(c)_:

 

(i) if the Cash Election Amount exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount,
then the following consideration shall be paid in respect of each Cash
Electing Share:

(A) an amount of cash equal to the product of (1) the Cash Election
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(c)_) _multiplied by_ (2) the greater of (a) a fraction, rounded
to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the Available Cash
Election Amount and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Amount and
(b) zero (0) (the amount calculated in clause (2) of this paragraph, the "
_Cash Fraction_ "); and

 

(B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (1) the Stock Election
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(c)_) _multiplied by_ (2) the result of one (1) minus the Cash
Fraction; and

(ii) if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount,
then the following consideration shall be paid in respect of each Stock
Electing Share:

 

 __(A) an amount of cash equal to the result of (1) the amount of such excess
_divided by_ (2) the number of Stock Electing Shares; and __

(B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (1) the Stock Election
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(c)_) _multiplied by_ (2) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal
places, the numerator of which is the difference between (a) the Cash Election
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(c)_) and (b) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this
paragraph and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Consideration
(before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_).

(d) _Cancelled Shares_. Each Company Share that is owned directly by
the Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), Parent or Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as the exchange agent
(the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be
subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company) for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Fractional
Share Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Exchange
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Shares
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the

 



-5-  aggregate number of Parent Shares included in the Merger Consideration
(excluding any fractional Parent Shares), and (ii) cash in immediately
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash
included in the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration
(such evidence of Parent Shares in book-entry form and cash amounts, including
any Dividend Consideration, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the
sole benefit of the holders of Company Shares. Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make delivery of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any
time be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, Parent
shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with
the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent or Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the
Exchange Agent to the holders of the Company Shares; _provided_ that any such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States
government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper
obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub,
and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company
Shares.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Company Shares represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which
Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and
shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Exchange Agent shall
reasonably agree upon (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and
instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior
to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed in writing by
Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in
proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as
applicable, for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as 

 



-6-  provided in _Section 2.5_), and any Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional
Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and
the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right
to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

 __(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to
deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held
through The Depository Trust Company, an executed Letter of Transmittal to
the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, as applicable, shall upon the Effective Time, in
accordance with The Depository Trust Companys customary procedures (including
receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" (or such other evidence
of transfer or surrender as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)) and
such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent and
The Depository Trust Company, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its
nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held through
it, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each
such Book-Entry Share the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, for each such
Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_) and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person
that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a Letter
of Transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall reasonably agree upon and (B) instructions for returning such Letter of
Transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, the forms of
which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery
of such Letter of __

 



-7-  Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable,
for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares.
Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement,
except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be
deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to
the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of transfers of
Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Shares, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing
Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of
the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, in accordance
with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, in each case
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, in respect of such holders surrender of its Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in  _Section 2.2(b)_.
Any Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration or Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, remaining unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the

 



-8-  Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
Merger Sub, Parent or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director,
agent or affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any part of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and
the Dividend Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit, in customary form, reasonably acceptable to
Parent (which shall contain an agreement in customary form to indemnify
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective affiliates
against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective affiliates on account of the alleged loss,
theft or destruction of such Certificates) of that fact by the holder thereof,
the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law. In addition, Merger Sub may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and Dividend Consideration, as
applicable, require the owner(s) of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent Shares issuable to
such holder hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions, if any,
shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in _Section
2.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or an affidavit
of loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) or Book-
Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and with a payment date prior to such surrender with respect to
the Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such Parent Shares.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_),
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal
for such Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
Fractional Share

 



-9-  Consideration or the Dividend Consideration. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under
the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable, subject to compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_,
solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional
Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase a Company Share
granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Election
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_) over the exercise price per Company Share of such Company Stock
Option and (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each award in respect of a Company Share
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a
Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall be assumed by Parent
and substituted with an award of restricted Parent Shares issued under a
Parent Equity Plan (a " _Parent Restricted Stock Award_ ") corresponding to a
number of whole Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such
Company Restricted Stock Award are fully achieved) and (ii) the Stock Election
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to  _Section
2.1(c)_). Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 2.4(b)_, each Parent
Restricted Stock Award issued pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting and acceleration
of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting
conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are substantially similar
to, those that applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each restricted stock unit award or deferred
stock unit award in respect of Company Shares granted under a Company Equity
Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company RSU Award_ " and, together with the Company Stock Options and the
Company Restricted Stock Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") and that is
held by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be assumed
by Parent and substituted with a restricted stock unit award to be settled in
Parent Shares issued under a Parent Equity Plan (a " _Parent RSU Award_ ")
corresponding to a number of whole Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (i) the number

 



-10-  of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions
applicable to such Company RSU Award are achieved at target levels) and (ii)
the Stock Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_). Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
2.4(c)_, each Parent RSU Award issued pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting and
acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based
vesting conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are substantially
similar to, those that applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU Award held by a non-employee
director of the Company shall fully vest (to the extent unvested) and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Cash
Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_) in respect of each Company Share underlying such Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay, through the Surviving Corporations
standard payroll procedures, the cash amounts described in this _Section
2.4_, less applicable Tax withholdings, on the next regularly scheduled
payroll date following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, to the extent that payment of the amounts described in
this _Section 2.4_ with respect to Company Equity Awards that constitute
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code would
otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payment at the
earliest time permitted under the Company Equity Plan and applicable award
agreement that would not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty.

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_.

 

(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Parent Board or the
compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.4_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations
of the Company with respect to the Company Restricted Stock Awards
and Company RSU Awards that are converted into Parent Restricted Stock Awards
and Parent RSU Awards, respectively, and the award agreements evidencing the
grants thereof. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon the
vesting or settlement of the Parent Restricted Stock Awards and Parent RSU
Awards in accordance with this _Section 2.4_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to cause
a sufficient number of Parent Shares to be registered and issuable under the
Parent RSU Awards, Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form
S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to Parent RSU
Awards and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Parent RSU Awards remain outstanding.

 



-11- 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

2.6 _Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing fractional
Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all shares
represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender of any right
thereto, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the Fractional Share
Consideration.

 

2.8 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of Company Shares (other than
Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) (each, a " _Holder_ ") shall have the
right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 2, to submit an
election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.8_. 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.8_ (an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of
Company Shares owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires
to make a Mixed Election, (ii) the number of such Company Shares with respect
to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election, (iii) the number of
Company Shares owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires
to make a Stock Election and (iv) the particular shares for which such Holder
desires to make any such election, and the order in which either such
election is to apply to any such shares if the election is subject to
proration under _Section 2.1(c)_.

 



-12- (b) The Company shall prepare a form of election reasonably acceptable to
Parent (the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by the Company to
Holders so as to permit such Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election prior to the Election Deadline.

 

(c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable,
the Form of Election to Holders as of the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Election Deadline. The Company shall make available one or more
Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
Persons who become Holders during the period following the record date for
the Company Stockholders Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline.

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by (i) the Certificates, if any, to which
such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of such Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_), and (ii) in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the
procedures set forth in the Form of Election. As used herein, unless otherwise
agreed in advance by the parties, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the date that the Parties shall agree is as near as
practicable to two (2) Business Days preceding the Closing Date.

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke such Holders Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of
such Holders Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates
as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_), or any documents in respect of Book-Entry
Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election is
validly made with respect to any Company Shares, any subsequent transfer of
such Company Shares shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from the Company or Parent that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Article 7\. The Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made,
changed or revoked with respect to any Company Shares (none of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any
Company shareholder of any applicable defect). In the event the Exchange
Agent makes a determination that an Election was not properly made, such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the Company Shares covered
by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Mixed
Consideration Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made with
respect to such shares.

ARTICLE 3 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed on or after January
1, 2016 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (other than any
disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements," and any other disclosures that are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature but, for the purpose of clarification, including

 



-13-  and giving effect to any factual or historical statements included in any
such statements), but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be
applicable to _Sections 3.2(a)_ ,  _3.2(b)_ or _3.2(c)_ or (ii) the
corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that
disclosure in any Section or Subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement and all
other sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation, duly organized and validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of Delaware and has requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has requisite corporate
or organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and each of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined in
Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act) (each, a " _Significant
Company Subsidiary_ ") is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") not
filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) any amendments to the Bylaws
of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") not filed prior to the date hereof
with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Significant Company
Subsidiary. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
provisions of the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws.

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the
date hereof a true, correct and complete list of the Company Subsidiaries,
together with the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case
may be, of each Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns any Equity Interest in any
Person other than the Company Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, all
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
each Company Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

 



-14- 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000
Company Shares, of which, as of the close of business on June 5, 2018 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), there were 22,372,641 Company Shares issued and
outstanding (including 188,942 Company Shares underlying Company Restricted
Stock Awards (assuming vesting at target performance levels with respect to
Company Restricted Stock Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting)
and excluding 110,874 Company Shares held in treasury) and (ii) 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which, as of the Capitalization Date, no
shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. No Company
Subsidiary owns any Company Shares or has any option or warrant to purchase
any Company Shares or any other Equity Interest in the Company. All of the
outstanding Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

 

(b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has no
Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock subject to or reserved
for issuance, except for (i) 621,485 Company Shares subject to outstanding
Company Stock Options under the Company Equity Plans, (ii) 411,599 Company
Shares subject to outstanding Company RSU Awards (assuming vesting at target

future issuance under the Company Equity Plans for awards not yet granted.
All Company Shares subject to issuance under the Company Equity Plans, upon
issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

(c) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, except for the
Company Equity Awards and the Convertible Notes due 2020, there are no
outstanding Equity Interests or other options, warrants or other rights,
relating to or based on the value of any Equity Interests of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
issue, acquire or sell any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Since the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the
Company has not issued any Company Shares, Company Equity Awards or other
Equity Interests (including shares of Company Preferred Stock) other than
Company Shares issued upon the exercise or settlement of Company Equity Awards
outstanding as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date in
accordance with their terms or Company Shares issued upon the exercise of the
Convertible Notes due 2020.

(d) Except with respect to the Company Equity Awards pursuant to the Company
Equity Plans and the related award agreements, there are no obligations

available, to the Company or its Representatives or affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the accuracy or
completeness thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Parent, Merger

contained in this _Article 4_.

4.19  _Financing_.

(a) Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter
dated June 7, 2018 (as the same may be amended or replaced, in each case in
accordance with _Section 5.13(a)_, the " _Commitment Letter_ ") from the
lenders party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the
Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide
debt financing in the amounts set forth therein. The debt financing committed
pursuant to the Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Financing_."

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
the executed Commitment Letter and any fee letters related thereto, subject,
in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee, pricing, "price
flex" and other economic provisions that could not reasonably be expect to
affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or principal amount
of the Financing.

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the
Financing in the amount contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ and _6.2(b)_ ,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the
Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have
knowledge that any of the Lenders will not perform its obligations
thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind
relating to the Financing that could affect the
conditionality, enforceability, principal amount or availability of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.2(a)_ and _6.2(b)_ , the Financing, when funded in accordance with the terms
of the Commitment Letter, together with available cash of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and Merger Sub, will
provide Parent with net cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement and under the Commitment Letter, including the payment of the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, any payments in respect of
equity compensation obligations to be made in connection with the Merger,
and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of Parent,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in
connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the
Commitment Letter (such amounts, collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_ ").

 



-37- (e) The Commitment Letter constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of all the parties thereto and is in full force and effect (except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to general equitable
principles, including specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief). As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or failure
to satisfy a condition by Parent under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letter, and Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely
basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the date of
the Closing. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or
before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due
on or before the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, (i) the Commitment
Letter has not been modified, amended or altered, (ii) none of the respective
commitments thereunder has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and
(iii) to the Knowledge of Parent, no modification or amendment to the
Commitment Letter is currently contemplated (except any modification or
amendment solely to the extent necessary to add lenders, lead arrangers,
book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (including in
replacement of a Lender)).

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement.

 

4.20 _Solvency_. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger and any financing being entered into by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection therewith) and the payment of all related fees and expenses, and
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in _Sections 6.1_ and  _6.2_ :

(a) the Fair Value of the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, shall exceed their Liabilities;

(b) the Present Fair Saleable Value of the assets of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, shall exceed their Liabilities;

(c) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall be able
to pay their Liabilities as they mature; and

(d) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall not be
left with unreasonably small capital to carry on its businesses and all
businesses in which it is about to engage.

 



-38- For purposes of this _Section 4.20_, the following terms have the following
meanings: 

(i) " _Fair Value_ " means the amount at which the assets (both tangible and
intangible), in their entirety, of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing
seller, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having
reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any
compulsion to act.

(ii) " _Liabilities_ " means the recorded liabilities (including contingent
liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the Closing Date immediately after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any financing being entered into in connection
therewith), determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. For
purposes of this definition, the amount of any contingent liability at any
time shall be computed as the amount that would reasonably be expected to
become an actual and matured liability.

(iii) " _Present Fair Saleable Value_ " means the amount that could be
obtained by an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer if
the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are
sold with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under present
conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such
conditions can be reasonably evaluated.

Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and shall instruct and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Representatives to,
(A) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours after the execution of this

months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or

understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any contact by the
Company or any Company Representative with any Person is in furtherance of the
Companys obligations pursuant to this clause (C), such contact shall not
violate the other restrictions of this _Section 5.3_). Any material
violations of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.3_ by any Company
Subsidiary or any director or executive officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a material breach of this  _Section 5.3_ by
the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time that the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, which Acquisition Proposal
was made or renewed on or after the date of this Agreement and does not
result from a breach of the obligations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_, (i)
the Company and the Company Representatives shall be permitted to participate
in discussions regarding such Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its advisors, based on
information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and the failure to
take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the
Company may (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including nonpublic information) to the Third Party
making such Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and potential sources of
financing and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and potential
sources of financing regarding such Acquisition Proposal (subject to promptly
and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours, notifying Parent of the
status and material details thereof (including copies of any written
documentation that is material to such Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ that
the Company (A) will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and
will instruct the Company Representatives not to, disclose any material
nonpublic information to such Person without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (B) will provide to Parent any
material nonpublic information concerning the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person that was not
previously provided or made available to Parent as promptly as practicable
(and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of providing such
information to such other Person).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours after knowledge of receipt by an executive officer or director of the
Company) notify Parent in the event that the Company receives (or obtains
Knowledge that any Company Representative has received) any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after knowledge of receipt by an executive officer or
director of the Company) provide to Parent the identity of the Third Party
making such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or,
where no such copy is available, a reasonable summary of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within

 



-46-  twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) advise Parent if the
Company determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions
or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section
5.3(b)_. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a prompt (and,
in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) basis of the status and material
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including by providing copies of any written documentation material
to such Acquisition Proposal).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that (i)
has not been withdrawn, (ii) did not result from a breach of the obligations
set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ and (iii) that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its advisors, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may at any time prior to the time that the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (A) effect a Change of Board Recommendation
with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in
either case, subject to the requirements of _Section 5.3(f)_ and, in the case
of clause (B), _provided_ , that the Company (x) pays, or causes to be paid,
to Intermediate Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination and (y) immediately
following or concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive
acquisition agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time that the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, and subject to compliance with the
requirements of  _Section 5.3(f)_, effect a Change of Board Recommendation
if (i) the Company Board determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and
is continuing and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of
Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_ or  _Section 5.3(e)_ or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section 7.1(f)_
unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the
Companys intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (and shall have
provided to Parent a copy of the available proposed transaction agreement to
be entered into in respect of such Acquisition Proposal) or details of such
Intervening Event, as applicable, and (y):

 

(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent that would reasonably be expected
to (A) obviate the need to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or (B)
cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal,
as applicable; and

 



-47- (ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments or
proposed amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms
hereof) and any other agreements that may be proposed in writing by Parent
(the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City
time, on the last day of the Notice Period and shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its advisors and outside counsel, that the
failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_
or  _Section 5.3(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.3(d)_ and _Section 7.1(f)_, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any (A) material changes relating to
such Intervening Event or (B) material revisions to such Superior Proposal
offered in writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, as applicable,
shall constitute a new Intervening Event or Acquisition Proposal, as
applicable, and, in each case, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to again comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the
Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days with respect thereto, but no
such new written notice shall shorten the original Notice Period.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or violate
applicable Law. The issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop,
look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, in which the
Company indicates that it has not changed the Company Board Recommendation as
of the date of such statement, shall not constitute a Change of Board
Recommendation.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 5.3(a)_ to the contrary, the
Company shall not grant any waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any
standstill or similar agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may grant a waiver or
release under any standstill agreement, or any provision of
any confidentiality or similar agreement with similar effect, (i) if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
(ii) in response to an Acquisition Proposal made under such circumstances in
which the Company is permitted under this _Section 5.3_ to participate in
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal, but only to the extent
necessary to allow it to pursue or consummate such Acquisition Proposal,
subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 5.3_. The Company shall
provide written notice to Parent of waiver or release of any standstill by
the Company, including disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto and
a summary of the material circumstances relating thereto. Except for the
waiver or release of any standstill, or any provision of any confidentiality
or similar agreement with similar effect, as contemplated by this _Section
5.3(h)_, the Company shall not release or permit the release of any Person
from, or amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit
the amendment, waiver, termination or modification of, any provision of, any
confidentiality or similar agreement or provision to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or under which the 

 



-48-  Company or any Company Subsidiary has any rights. The Company shall not, and
shall instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any
Company Representative (on the Companys behalf) to, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information
specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section
5.3_.

5.4 _Efforts_.

 

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be

necessary, proper or advisable under Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) take all such actions (if any) as

and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (B) from any Third Party any
consents or notices that are required to be obtained or made by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,

of this clause (B), only to the extent that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
reasonably determine, after consultation and cooperation with one another,
that such consent or notice should be obtained or made, (iv) cause the
satisfaction of all conditions within its control set forth in Article 6, (v)
defend and seek to prevent the initiation of all actions, lawsuits or other
legal, regulatory or other Proceedings to which it is a party challenging or
affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable
Order, (vi) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order that may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the

this Agreement and the Merger required under any other applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall anything in this Agreement
require, or be construed to require, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates, or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or any of their respective affiliates, to (A) undertake any efforts, or to
take or consent to any action, including those described in this _Section
5.4(a)_, if such efforts, action or consent,

operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
prior to the Effective Time, (B) take any actions, including the actions
described in this _Section 5.4(a)_, with respect to Parent, its affiliates or
their respective assets, categories of assets, businesses, relationships,
contractual rights, obligations or arrangements or (C) take or agree to take
any action with respect to its business or operations in connection with
obtaining approvals from any Governmental Entity, unless the effectiveness of
such agreement or action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to
this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, except as may be consented to
in advance in writing by the Company, directly or indirectly through one
or more of its affiliates, acquire any Person or material assets thereof or
interest therein, if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to cause a
delay beyond the Outside Date or prevent the consummation of the Merger.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or

written communications received or provided by such party, or any of its
Subsidiaries, from or to any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that
Parent and the Company may, as each reasonably and in good faith deems
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties
with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the
other parties may reasonably request with respect to all notices, submissions,
or filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated by

advance and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in

addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or other Proceeding other than the matters contemplated by _Section

contemplated hereby, each party hereto will consult with the other parties in

opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and
Company shall jointly control all aspects of the parties efforts to
gain regulatory clearance either before any Governmental Entity or in any
action brought to enjoin the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any
Competition Law, and shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another in doing so

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, control over its business operations. 

5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, and as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but no later than thirty-five (35) days) following
the date hereof, file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will constitute a part of the
Form S-4. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Subject to _Sections
5.3(d)_ and 5.3(e) and the other applicable terms of this Agreement, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and
also include, in their entirety, the Fairness Opinions, together with
summaries thereof. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts, and the Company
shall cooperate with Parent, to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the
SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing in order to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall
also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of Parent
Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of Company Shares, or holders of a
beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. Each of Parent or the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other parties with copies of
any written comments, and advise each other of any oral comments, with
respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the SEC.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and provide each other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with
the SEC, and shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments thereon made by the other party or its counsel, and will provide each
other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Subject to _Section
5.3(g)_, but notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without providing
the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and
without the parties consulting and cooperating with one another, and
considering in good faith the view of one another in doing so (provided,
that, without limiting the foregoing, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be made without the approval of both the Company
and Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

 



-51-  delayed). If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company and such
information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto discovering such
information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with applicable
Law.

 

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable
following the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 by the SEC for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall be determined by the Company with
prior consultation with Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
change the date of (or the record date for), postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall (i) be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions without the prior consent of
Parent and (ii) shall postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting on
one or more occasions if so requested by Parent, in each case, if, on the date
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Shares to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present.

(c) The Company Board shall, except in the case of a Change of Board
Recommendation made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
stockholders to the effect as set forth in  _Section 3.3_, and, subject to
_Section 5.3_, shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Change in Board Recommendation
pursuant to _Section 5.3_, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Companys
stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. The Company shall,
upon the reasonable request of Parent, during the last seven (7) Business Days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, request its proxy
solicitor to advise Parent at least one (1) time each Business Day as to the
aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company
Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall
not be unconditionally withheld, delayed or conditioned), and except as
required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 



-52- 5.6 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not, and
shall cause their respective controlled affiliates not to, issue any press
release or make any public statement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject, in which case, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and practicable under the circumstances, the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall consult in
good faith with the other party before making any such public announcement,
(b) with respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company
permitted by _Section 5.3_ or (c) statements consistent in all material
respects with any release, disclosure or other public statement previously
made in accordance with this _Section 5.6_. The press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of,
and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and
Parent.

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Benefit Plans in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a
period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each Person who is employed by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who
continues in the employ of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective affiliates on or after the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ")
(i) a base salary or wage rate and short-term incentive cash compensation
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to
the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other
compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to the Company Employee immediately before the
Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and for calculating
severance and vacation entitlements under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (each, a " _New Plan_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that coverage under such New Plans is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all eligibility waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable Old Plans, and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plans ending on the date such

 



-53-  employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

(d) The Company may implement a retention program in accordance with _Section
5.7(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
Person any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates. Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.7_,
no provision of this Agreement: (i) shall limit the ability of the Company or
any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate in accordance
with its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be deemed or construed to amend,
establish, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or (iii) create any third party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any current or
former service provider or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof)) or any right to employment or
continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with
the Company or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

5.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
directors, officers and employees of the Company or each Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any Company
Subsidiary and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement with any directors, officers and employees and made available
to Parent (collectively, the " _Existing Indemnification Agreements_ "), in
each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, arising out of
acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred in the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect to the
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.8_
in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth in the Company

 



-54-  Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and any
Existing Indemnification Agreements;  _provided_ , that the applicable
Covered Person provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is
ultimately determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 5.8_ or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters subject to
indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.

 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws. Following the Effective Time, the Existing
Indemnification Agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation,
without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

 

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the directors
and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent
to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (true and complete
copies of which have been previously made available to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such
amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, which policies shall be approved by Parent and provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six
(6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.8_.

 



-55- (e) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns); it being expressly agreed that the Covered
Persons (including successors and assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 5.8_. In the event of any breach by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent of this _Section 5.8_, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 5.8_ as such fees are incurred upon the written
request of such Covered Person.

 

5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium,"
"business combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is deemed to
be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate and take all action reasonably available
to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing. Neither Parent, Merger Sub
nor the Company will take any action that would cause this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject
to the requirements imposed by any such Laws.

 

5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a "covered
person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Shares and
Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

 

5.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties shall cooperate and consult with
one another in connection with any Proceeding by the Companys stockholders
against the Company or any of its directors, officers or affiliates with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and the
Company shall give Parent notice of any such Proceeding as promptly
as practicable. The Company shall not compromise or settle any Proceeding
commenced against it or its directors, officers or affiliates relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger)
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

5.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the
Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger and such other Parent Shares to be
reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The Company
shall cooperate with Parent in connection with the foregoing, including by
providing information reasonably requested by Parent in connection therewith.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the
delisting of the Company and of the Company Shares from NASDAQ as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 



-56- 5.13 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Intermediate Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper
to obtain the proceeds of the Financing prior to the date upon which the
Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including
by using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment
Letter, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements (which, with respect to the
bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably
necessary in connection with the funding of the Financing) with respect to
the Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") not less favorable to Parent,
Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub with respect to conditionality than the
terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter) and (iii) satisfy (or, if
deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements that are
under its control and comply with its obligations thereunder. In the event
that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
have been satisfied, Parent and Intermediate Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and the Definitive
Documents in a timely and diligent manner to cause the Lenders to comply with
their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the Financing.

 

(i) Neither Parent nor Intermediate Parent shall, nor shall they permit Merger
Sub to, without the prior written consent of the Company: (A) permit any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements if such amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the
Financing, (2) reduces the amount of the Financing, (3) adversely affects the
ability of Parent or Intermediate Parent to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements relative to the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (4) would otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend
the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book-runners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement, if the addition of such parties,
individually or in the aggregate, does not add new (or adversely modify any
existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing); or (B) terminate
the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement. Parent and Intermediate
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement.

(ii) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (A) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient, when
taken together with available cash of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the available portion of the 

 



-57-  Financing, to fund the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the
other Merger Amounts (the " _Alternate Financing_ ") from the same or other
sources and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such
alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth
in the Financing and (B) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability
and the reason therefor. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
foregoing, in the event that (1) any portion of the Financing or any financing
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement structured
as high yield or debt securities financing is unavailable, regardless of the
reason therefor, (2) all conditions contained in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than (x) any such conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing, and (y) those
conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by
Parent, Intermediate Parent or Merger Sub of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement), (3) the
Marketing Period shall have ended and (4) the bridge facilities contemplated
by the Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained
in accordance with this _Section 5.13_) are available on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter (or replacements thereof), then
each of Parent, Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used
immediately in lieu of such affected portion of the high yield financing. For
the purposes of this Agreement, in the event any Alternate Financing is
obtained and an alternate commitment letter (or similar agreement) (the "
_Alternate Commitment Letter_ ") is entered into in compliance herewith, (A)
any reference in this Agreement to "Financing" shall mean the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (B)
below and any Definitive Agreements (including definitive agreements relating
to Alternate Financing), and (B) the term Commitment Letter (or defined terms
that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include any Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question and any Alternate Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect. Parent and Intermediate Parent shall
provide the Company with prompt notice of any material breach, material
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or
any Definitive Agreement and a copy of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender or other Alternate Financing source with respect
to any material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement of any provision
thereof. Upon request of the Company, Parent shall appraise the Company of
developments relating to the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding,
compliance by Parent and/or Merger Sub with this _Section 5.13_ shall not
relieve Parent, Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide and use reasonable
best efforts to cause its officers, employees, consultants, agents, advisors
and other representatives, including legal and accounting, (the " _Financing
Representatives_ ") to provide, all customary cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with Parents financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing),
including:

 

(i) assisting in preparation for and participation in marketing efforts
(including lender meetings and calls) and a reasonable number of drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions between senior
management of the Company and the Company 

 



-58-  Subsidiaries and actual or prospective lenders, investors and ratings
agencies, in each case at reasonable, mutually agreed times, and with
reasonable advance notice, and assisting Parent in obtaining ratings in
connection with Parents financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing);

 

(ii) assisting Parent and its financing sources (including the Financing
Sources) in the preparation of customary offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, lender
presentations, prospectuses and similar customary marketing documents for any
of the Financing or any other financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ ");

(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable in connection with the
anticipated timing for the marketing of the Financing or any financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (A) furnishing
Parent and Parents financing sources (including the Financing Sources) and
their respective representatives with the Required Information that is
Compliant and (B) informing Parent if the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall have Knowledge of any facts that would reasonably be expected to cause
any of the Required Information not to be Compliant;

(iv) as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) using reasonable best efforts
to cause the Companys independent auditors to furnish all required consents
and reports reasonably required for the Offering Documents (including consents
to be named therein), (B) upon the reasonable request of Parent, using
reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys independent auditors to
furnish accountants comfort letters (including customary "negative assurance"
and "tickmarks") with respect to the financial and related information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contained in the Offering Documents that are
customary in connection with high-yield financings of the type contemplated as
part of the Financing and (C) providing appropriate representations to the
Companys independent auditors in connection with auditor due diligence
sessions and the foregoing clauses (A) and (B);

(v) assisting Parent in connection with the preparation of pro forma
financial information and financial statements to the extent such pro forma
financial information or financial statements are required by SEC Regulatory
Requirements or necessary or reasonably required by Parents financing
sources (including the Financing Sources) to be included in any offering
documents; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries or Financing Representatives shall be required to prepare any
such pro forma financial information or financial statements or responsible
in any manner for information relating to the proposed debt and equity
capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial information;

 

(vi) facilitating the execution and delivery as of (but not before) the
Closing of any definitive financing documents or other
certificates, customary legal opinions from applicable outside counsel to
Parent and Merger Sub, including local counsel, or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent; and

 

(vii) providing at least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
documentation and other information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act to the extent
requested at least nine (9) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date.

 



-59- The foregoing or anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any of the Financing
Representatives shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ or _Section 5.14_ that would: (i) require
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or
consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing or any other
financing of Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other matter or execute or deliver any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing
certificate, document, instrument or agreement, in each case, prior to the
Closing (other than customary representation letters referred to in clause
(iv) above), (ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be
breached by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) require the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other
similar fee prior to the Closing or incur any other liability or other
obligation prior to Closing or have any obligation of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate, document or
instrument (other than this Agreement) be effective until the Closing, (iv)
cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (v) conflict
with the organizational documents of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any applicable Laws, (vi) provide access to or disclose
information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (vii) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this
_Section 5.13_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Financing or any other financing of Parent in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or any of the Financing Representatives in connection with such
cooperation pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ or any action taken by them
pursuant to _Section 5.14_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and the Financing Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing or any other financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any action taken by them
pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ or _Section 5.14_ and any information used
in connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ or _Section 5.14_), in each
case, except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith,
gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Financing
Representatives.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries logos and other trade marks in connection with the Financing or
any other financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that such logos shall be used solely in a customary
manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 



-60- (d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this _Section 5.13_ represent the sole
obligation of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of
any financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by Parent or Merger
Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no
other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. In no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Intermediate Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parents, Intermediate Parents or
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required
Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required
Information is (i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set
forth in the definition of "Required Information". For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the
cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section
5.13_ at any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between
the date hereof and the Closing; _provided_ , _that_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to
access the markets. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent reasonably requests the
Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that
contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines is necessary (after
consultation with the Company) to include in customary offering materials for
the Financing or any other financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case other than offering
materials to be shared only with "private side" investors that are subject to
a confidentiality agreement), then, upon the Companys review of and
reasonable satisfaction with such filing, the Company shall file such Current
Report on Form 8-K.

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its affiliates
pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the condition
set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_, as it applies to Parents, Intermediate
Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this _Section 5.13_, shall be
deemed satisfied notwithstanding any breach of such obligations by Parent,
Intermediate Parent or Merger Sub, as long as at such time, Parent and
Intermediate Parent have deposited cash in an amount equal to at least the
Merger Amounts in a segregated account to be used solely for the purpose of
funding the Merger Amounts.

 



-61- 5.14 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_.

 

(a) _Prepayment of Indebtedness_. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts, and shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts, to deliver to Parent at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date a copy of a payoff letter (subject to the delivery
of funds and cash collateralization, backstopping or replacement of letters of
credit, in each case, as arranged by Parent) with respect to the Revolving
Credit Agreement (the " _Subject Indebtedness_ ") in customary form (the "
_Payoff Letter_ "), which Payoff Letter shall (i) indicate the total
amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest,
prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other monetary
obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no
claim has been made) then due and payable under the Subject Indebtedness as
of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the "
_Payoff Amount_ ") (ii) state that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount under the
Payoff Letter, the Subject Indebtedness and all related loan documents shall
be terminated (other than the terms thereof that expressly survive such
termination in accordance with the terms of such documents) and (iii) provide
that all guarantees of any of the Company Subsidiaries of the Subject
Indebtedness and, to the extent secured, all Liens securing obligations in
respect of the Subject Indebtedness shall be released and terminated upon
payment of the Payoff Amount and the cash collateralization, backstopping or
replacement of any outstanding letters of credit (which cash
collateralization, backstopping, replacement shall be arranged by Parent) on
the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall repay the
outstanding amount of the Subject Indebtedness by wire transfer of
immediately available funds arranged by Parent as provided for in the Payoff
Letter.

(b) _Senior Notes_.

 

(i) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the
terms of that certain indenture, dated as of May 18, 2017 (the " _Indenture_
") by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and
Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), one or
more offers to purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer" (as such
term is defined in the Indenture) or any tender offer, or any exchange offer,
and to conduct a consent solicitation, if any (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), with respect to any or all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2022
issued by the Company prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Indenture (the
" _Senior Notes_ ") identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to,
on, or after the date hereof on terms that are acceptable to Parent; provided,
that any such Debt Offer shall be consummated using funds provided by Parent.
Parent shall not be permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer until
Parent shall have provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase,
offer to exchange, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal and
press release, if any, in connection therewith and each other document
relevant to such transaction that will be distributed by Parent to holders of
the Senior Notes in the applicable Debt Offer (collectively, the " _Debt Offer
Documents_ ") a period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt
Offer to allow the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the related Debt Offer Documents. Parent will reasonably
consult with the Company regarding the material terms and conditions of any
Debt Offer (other than financial terms), including the timing and
commencement of any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent deadlines.
The closing (or, if applicable, effectiveness) of the Debt Offers shall be

 



-62-  expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the Company will
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent, at Parents request, to
facilitate the initial settlement of the Debt Offers by Parent on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that the consummation of a Debt Offer with respect to the
Senior Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. The Debt Offers shall be
conducted in compliance with (and the terms of any Debt Offer shall comply
with) the Indenture and SEC Regulatory Requirements, and the Company shall not
be required to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that is not in
compliance with the Senior Notes, the Indenture and SEC
Regulatory Requirements. Subject to _Section 5.13(b)_, at Parents expense,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts
to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Debt Offer; provided that prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor counsel for the Company shall be required
to furnish any officers certificates, legal opinions or negative assurance
letters in connection with the Debt Offers (other than, in connection with the
execution of a supplemental indenture relating to any consent solicitation of
the type described in clause (ii) below, the Company delivering customary
officers certificates, and using reasonable best efforts to cause counsel for
the Company to deliver customary legal opinions, respectively, to the trustee
under the Indenture, to the extent such certificates and opinions would not
(in the opinion of the Company, its counsel and the Trustee) conflict with
applicable Laws, the terms of the Senior Notes or the Indenture and would be
accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered) or
execute any other instruments or agreements in connection therewith other than
the supplemental indenture described in clause (ii) below. To the extent that
the provisions of SEC Regulatory Requirements conflict with this  _Section
5.14(b)(i)_, Parent and the Company shall comply with SEC Regulatory
Requirements and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under
this Agreement by such compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or its legal counsel be
required to give an opinion with respect to the Financing or any other
financing of Parent or Merger Sub.

 

(ii) To the extent any Debt Offer includes a consent solicitation, then
subject to the receipt of the requisite consents, the Company and
the applicable Company Subsidiaries shall execute a supplemental indenture to
the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, amending the
terms and provisions of the Indenture as described in the relevant Debt Offer
Documents as reasonably requested by Parent, which supplemental indenture
shall become operative no earlier than the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its officers,
directors or other representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or
execute any amendments or other agreement that is not permitted under
applicable Law, the terms of the Senior Notes or the Indenture or would become
operative prior to the Effective Time.

7.3 _Termination Fee_.

(a) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent in
accordance with _Section 7.1(e)_ or by the Company in accordance with
_Section 7.1(f)_, then the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to
Intermediate Parent (or its designee) prior to or concurrently with such

Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by Parent, a
termination fee equal to eighteen million four hundred seventy-two thousand
dollars ($18,472,000) (the " _Termination_

 



-67-   _Fee_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Termination Fee
becomes payable as a result of the termination of this Agreement prior to the
Window Period End Time (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ in
response to a Change of Board Recommendation effected in compliance with
_Section 5.3(d)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal by a Qualified Bidder or
(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal by a Qualified Bidder, then, in the case of either of the immediately
preceding clauses (i) or (ii), "Termination Fee" means an amount equal to ten
million dollars ($10,000,000).

(b) The parties agree that (i) if (A) this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with  _Section 7.1(b)_ or _7.1(g)_ and, prior to the date of such
termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is (1) made public by the
Company or any other Person and (2) not withdrawn or (B) this Agreement is

Company (A) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated,
or (B) consummates any such Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay
(or cause to be paid) the Termination Fee to Intermediate Parent (or its
designee), no later than two (2) Business Days after the consummation of such
transaction, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not
be obligated to pay the Termination Fee with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is consummated. For purposes of this
_Section 7.3(b)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_, except that the references to "20%"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 

 __(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in this _Section
7.3_ is an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this _Section
7.3_, Merger Sub, Intermediate Parent and Parent would not have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount
due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, the Company shall pay to Merger Sub all
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable
attorneys fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
action initiated by Parent, Intermediate Parent or Merger Sub), together with
interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is
made. __

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 

(e) Subject to Parents and Merger Subs rights set forth in _Section 8.14_,
if and to the extent the Termination Fee is required to be, and is in fact,
paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.3,_ Intermediate Parents (or
its designees) right to receive payment thereof shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or
affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of

 



-68-  this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger (except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to
_Section 7.3(c)_ and except that the applicable Company Related Parties
shall remain obligated for, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to
remedies with respect to the provisions and agreements surviving such
termination pursuant to _Section 7.2_). For the avoidance of doubt, while
Parent and Merger Sub may pursue, in the alternative, both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with _Section 8.14_ and the payment of the
Termination Fee under _Section 7.3_, under no circumstances shall Parent and
Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and the Termination Fee.

7.4  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
boards of directors; _provided_ however, that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of the Company, any amendment of this Agreement, which by Law
otherwise requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company.
This Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed
by the parties hereto.

7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and Company
Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), the
Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements (except the
Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

8.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties.

8.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than (a) any Persons entitled to indemnification or insurance benefits under
the provisions of _Section 5.8_ following the Effective Time, with respect
to such provisions, (b) the stockholders of the Company, after the Effective
Time, as applicable, with respect to the right of such stockholders to receive
the Merger Consideration, in the case of Company Shares converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger, (c) if the Effective
Time occurs, the right of holders of the Company Equity Awards to receive
payments contemplated hereby in respect thereof after the Effective Time and
(d) as provided in _Section 8.15_. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and

 



-84-  are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently,
may not accurately characterize actual facts or circumstances.

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words
"include" and "including" and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be
terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Annexes" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits and Annexes to this Agreement. The
Company Disclosure Letter and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute
a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all purposes. The
words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular Section or Article in which such words
appear. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S.
dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Disclosure of any item on the Company
Disclosure Letter by reference to any particular Section or Subsection of
this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute disclosure with respect to any
other Section or Subsection of this Agreement if the relevance of such
disclosure to such other Section or Subsection is reasonably apparent from
such disclosure or the context in which such disclosure is made. Except as
otherwise indicated, "made available" or terms of similar import mean made
available to Parent and its advisors in the electronic data room maintained by
the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at least one (1) day prior to the date hereof.

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

(a) Other than as set forth in _Section 8.15_, this Agreement and all claims
and causes of action arising in connection herewith shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 



-85- (b) Other than as set forth in _Section 8.15_, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising in connection herewith or any claim or cause of
action arising in connection with this Agreement or the negotiation hereof,
and any Proceeding for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by
any other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to or arising from this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation hereof in any court other
than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 8.12_, (ii) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the Proceeding in such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_ and agrees that service made in
such manner shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING
WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12(c)_.

 



-86- 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any the
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Delaware
Court of Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties will waive, in any action
for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. Either
partys pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an
election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or
remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue
remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party in the
case of a breach of this Agreement involving willful breach or fraud.

8.15 _Proceedings Involving Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company on behalf of itself, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of its controlled affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any
Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources, arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, the Financing or any of the agreements (including the
Commitment Letter) entered into in connection with the Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so
long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof
and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect
to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees
that any such Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would
result in the application of the laws of another state), except as otherwise
provided in the Commitment Letter or other applicable definitive document
relating to the Financing, (c) agrees not to bring or support or permit any
of its affiliates to bring or support any Proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in

 



-87-  the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of
process upon the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or its controlled
affiliates in any such Proceeding or proceeding shall be effective if notice
is given in accordance with _Section 8.3_, (e) irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly,
intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law trial by jury in any Proceeding brought against the Financing
Sources in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
Financing, the Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (g) agrees
that none of the Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or
Financing Representatives (in each case, other than Intermediate Parent under
the Commitment Letter) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing, the Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and (h) agrees
that the Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, clause (d) of the first sentence of _Section 8.10_ and this _Section
8.15_, and that such provisions and the definition of "Financing Sources" (and
any defined term used in any such provisions to the extent that any such
amendment of such definition would modify or amend the substance of any such
provision in a way adverse to the Financing Sources) shall not be amended in
any way adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of
the Financing Entities.

8.16 _Non-Recourse_. Each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and
its controlled affiliates, that all proceedings, claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or any other
agreement referenced herein or the transactions contemplated hereunder
(including any financing obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (B) the negotiation, execution
or performance this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, this Agreement or such other agreement), (C) any breach or
violation of this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein and (D)
any failure of the transactions contemplated hereunder or any other agreement
referenced herein (including any agreement in respect of financing obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to be
consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of)
the persons that are expressly identified herein as parties to this Agreement
and, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other agreement
referenced herein or otherwise to the contrary, each party hereto covenants,
agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its respective controlled
affiliates, that no recourse under this Agreement or any other agreement
referenced herein or in connection with any transactions contemplated hereby
(including any financing obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) shall be sought or had against any other
person and no other person shall have any liabilities or obligations (whether
in Contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by
statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted

 



-88-  piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) for
any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out
of, in connection with or related to the items in the immediately preceding
clauses (A) through (D), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no
personal liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise be incurred by any of the aforementioned, as such, arising under,
out of, in connection with or related to the items in the immediately
preceding clauses (A) through (D), in each case, except for claims that
any party hereto may assert against another party hereto solely in accordance
with, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to bring claims and
causes of action against (i) the Lenders related to or arising from the
Commitment Letter and the Financing or (ii) the Key Stockholder related to or
arising from the Voting Agreement, and, in each case, Parent does not waive
any liabilities, claims, causes of action or obligations with respect
thereto.
