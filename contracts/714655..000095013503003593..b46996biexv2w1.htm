 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  

  THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this  _"Agreement"_ ) is made and entered into as of June 20, 2003, by and among IDEC PHARMACEUTICALS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation _("IDEC"),_  BRIDGES MERGER CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC _("Merger Sub"),_ and BIOGEN, INC., a Massachusetts corporation  _("Biogen")._    

 WITNESSETH:   

  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of IDEC, Merger Sub and Biogen have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders that IDEC and Biogen engage in a business combination in a merger of equals in order to advance their respective long-term strategic business interests; and   

  WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the Boards of Directors of each of IDEC, Merger Sub and Biogen have approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into Biogen with Biogen continuing as the surviving corporation (the  _"Merger"_ ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Law (the _"MBCL"_ ); and   

  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Biogen has determined to recommend to its stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger; and   

  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of IDEC has determined to recommend to its stockholders approval of the IDEC Charter Amendment (as defined in _Section 1.8_) and the issuance of shares of IDEC Common Stock (as defined in  _Section 2.1(a)_) in connection with the Merger (the  _"Share Issuance"_ ); and   

  WHEREAS, IDEC, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the Merger; and   

  WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  _"Code"_ ), and this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.   

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   

 ARTICLE I  

 THE MERGER  

  SECTION 1.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCL, at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Biogen, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Biogen shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the _"Surviving Corporation"_ ) and shall succeed to and assume all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub in accordance with the MBCL.   

  SECTION 1.2 _Closing._  The closing of the Merger (the _"Closing"_ ) shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such    ##### 

  

 items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, One Beacon Street,
Boston, Massachusetts, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the _"Closing Date."_   

  

  SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCL (the _"Articles of Merger"_ ) with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the  _"Secretary of State"_ ) and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the MBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Secretary of State, or at such subsequent date or time as IDEC and Biogen shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the _"Effective Time."_    

  SECTION 1.4 _Effects of The Merger._ At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the MBCL.   

  SECTION 1.5 _Purposes of the Surviving Corporation._ The purposes of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in Article 2 of the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation.   

  SECTION 1.6 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation._ At the Effective Time, the Biogen Charter (as defined in  _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_) shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the articles of organization of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the MBCL and as provided in such articles of organization; _provided, however,_ that at the Effective Time, Article I of the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Biogen, Inc." After the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share. At the Effective Time, the Biogen By-Laws (as defined in  _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_) shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the MBCL and as provided in such by-laws.   

  SECTION 1.7 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the IDEC Designated Directors (as defined in _Section 5.14_) and the Biogen Designated Directors (as defined in  _Section 5.14_), until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Biogen immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly appointed.   

  SECTION 1.8 _IDEC Charter Amendment._ Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and receipt of IDEC Stockholder Approval (as defined in  _Section 3.2(c)(iii)_), pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law, IDEC shall cause the IDEC Charter (as defined in _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_) to be amended (the _"IDEC Charter Amendment"_ ) to (i) change the name of IDEC to "BIOGEN IDEC, INC." and (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of IDEC Common Stock to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares, by filing a Certificate of Amendment substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the _"IDEC Certificate of Amendment"_ ) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.   

  SECTION 1.9 _Alternative Structure._ Biogen and IDEC may mutually agree to revise the structure of the Merger provided for herein at any time prior to receipt of either Biogen Stockholder Approval (as defined in  _Section 3.1(c)(iii)_) or IDEC Stockholder Approval, or at any time thereafter if, with appropriate disclosure, any required further approval of the revised structure is obtained from the stockholders of Biogen and IDEC, as applicable;  _provided, however,_ that under any such revised structure the Merger would qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Biogen and IDEC agree to consider in good faith the request of the other party to revise the structure of the Merger from that set forth herein.    ##### 

  

 ARTICLE II  

 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of IDEC, Merger Sub, Biogen or the holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Biogen (together with any associated Biogen Rights (as defined in _Section 3.1(b)(i)_),  _"Biogen Common Stock"_ ):  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Conversion of Biogen Common  Stock._ Each share of
Biogen Common Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than  any shares of Biogen Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to  _Section 2.1(c)_ or, subject to  _Section 2.1(g)_, held by a
Dissenting Holder (as  defined in _Section 2.1(g)(i)_), shall be 
automatically converted into the right to receive 1.150 (the  _"Exchange
Ratio"_ ) fully paid and nonassessable  shares of common stock, par value
$0.0005 per share  _("IDEC Common Stock"),_ of IDEC (together with  any
associated IDEC Rights (as defined in  _Section 3.2(b)(i)_), the _"Merger 
Consideration"_ )) upon surrender of the Certificate (as  defined in _Section
2.2(b)_) which immediately prior  to the Effective Time represented such
share of Biogen Common  Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2(b)_
(or,  in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,  _Section
2.2(i)_). As a result of the Merger, at the  Effective Time, each holder of a
Certificate shall cease to have  any rights with respect thereto, except (i)
the right to  receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the 
shares of Biogen Common Stock represented by such Certificate  immediately
prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of  fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_  and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_, all to be issued or paid, without 
interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such  Certificate
in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ or  (ii) in the case of a Dissenting
Holder, the rights set  forth in _Section 2.1(g)._    
      
      |   (b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each  issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
shall be converted into one  fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.    
      
      |   (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares._   Each share of
Biogen Common Stock held in the treasury of  Biogen, if any, shall
automatically be extinguished without any  conversion, and no consideration
shall be delivered in respect  thereof.    
      
      |   (d) _Biogen Options and Employee Stock  Purchase
Plans._ At the Effective Time, (i) all options  to purchase Biogen Common
Stock (each, a _"Biogen  Option"_ ) issued and outstanding under each Biogen
Stock  Plan (as defined in _Section 3.1(b)(i)_) shall be  assumed by IDEC
in accordance with _Section 5.12(a)_  and (ii) all rights outstanding under
Biogens 1983  Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated, and
the  1994 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and 
restated (collectively, the _"Biogen Purchase  Plans"_ ), shall be treated as
set forth in  _Section 5.12(b)._    
      
      |   (e) _Fractional Shares._ No fraction of  a share of
IDEC Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the  Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of shares of Biogen  Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a  share of IDEC Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional  shares of IDEC Common Stock that otherwise would be received
by  such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders  Certificate(s),
receive from IDEC an amount of cash (rounded to  the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product  of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by
(ii) the average  closing price of one share of IDEC Common Stock for the
ten  (10) most recent trading days that IDEC Common Stock has  traded ending
on the trading day one day prior to the Effective  Time, as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market.    
      
      |   (f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio._   The Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the  appropriate effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split,  stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of  securities convertible into IDEC Common Stock or Biogen
Common  Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or  other
like change with respect to IDEC Common    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Stock or Biogen Common Stock having a record date  on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.    
      
      |   (g) _Dissenter s Rights._    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) No conversion under  _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof shall
occur with respect to  the shares of Biogen Common Stock held by a Dissenting
Holder;  _provided, however,_ that each share of Biogen Common Stock 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by  a Dissenting
Holder who shall, after the Effective Time,  withdraw his demand for
appraisal or lose his right of  appraisal, in either case pursuant to the
applicable provisions  of the MBCL, shall be deemed to be converted, as of
the  Effective Time, into the Merger Consideration as set forth in  _Section
2.1(a)_ hereof. The term _"Dissenting  Holder"_ shall mean a holder of Biogen
Common Stock who  has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with the
applicable  provisions of the MBCL concerning the right of such holder to 
dissent from the Merger and demand appraisal of such  holders shares of
Biogen Common Stock.    
      
      |   (ii) Any Dissenting Holder (A) who  (1) files with
Biogen a written objection to the Merger  before the Biogen Stockholders
Meeting (as defined in  _Section 5.1(b)_) and (2) states in such  objection
that he intends to demand payment for his shares if  the Merger is
consummated and (B) whose shares are not  voted in favor of the Merger shall
be entitled to demand payment  from Biogen for his shares of Biogen Common
Stock and an  appraisal of the value thereof, in accordance with the 
provisions of Sections 86 through 98 of the MBCL.    
    

  SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Exchange Agent._ At or prior to  the Effective
Time, IDEC shall engage an institution reasonably  satisfactory to Biogen to
act as exchange agent in connection  with the Merger (the _"Exchange Agent"_
),  pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to Biogen. At  the
Effective Time, IDEC shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,  in trust for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Biogen  Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time,  certificates representing the shares of IDEC Common
Stock  issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In addition,  IDEC shall make
available by depositing with the Exchange Agent,  as necessary from time to
time after the Effective Time as  needed, cash in an amount sufficient to
make the payments in  lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.1(e)_  and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of 
Biogen Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_. All cash
and IDEC Common Stock  deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred  to as the _"Exchange Fund."_     
      
      |   (b) _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly  after the
Effective Time, IDEC shall cause the Exchange Agent to  mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates  which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented  outstanding shares of Biogen Common Stock (the 
_"Certificates"_ ), which at the Effective Time  were converted into the
right to receive the Merger  Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_
hereof,  (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that  delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass
only upon delivery of the Certificates  to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such  other provisions as IDEC may reasonably specify)
and  (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the 
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing whole  shares of IDEC
Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional  shares pursuant to _Section
2.1(e)_ and any dividends  or other distributions payable pursuant to 
_Section 2.2(c)_. Upon surrender of Certificates for  cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or  agents as may be appointed by IDEC,
together with such letter of  transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance  with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may  reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such  Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a 
certificate representing that number of whole shares of IDEC  Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates  surrendered by such holder) to
which such holder is entitled  pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (which shall be 
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is  requested),
payment in lieu of fractional shares which such  holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or distributions 
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, and    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith  be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Biogen  Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of  Biogen, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares  of IDEC Common Stock may be issued to a Person (as
defined in  _Section 8.3(o)_) other than the Person in whose name  the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such  Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper  form for transfer and the Person
requesting such issuance shall  pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the  issuance of shares of IDEC Common Stock to a Person other
than  the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the 
satisfaction of IDEC that such tax has been paid or is not  applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at  any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to  receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid 
pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ or  _Section 2.2(c)_) upon such surrender. No
interest  shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(e)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_.    
      
      |   (c) _Distributions with Respect to  Unexchanged
Shares._ No dividends or other distributions with  respect to IDEC Common
Stock with a record date after the  Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered  Certificate with respect to the shares of IDEC
Common Stock  represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional  shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to  _Section
2.1(e)_ hereof, until such Certificate has  been surrendered in accordance
with this _Article II_.  Subject to Applicable Law (as defined in  _Section
3.1(g)(i)_), following surrender of any such  Certificate, there shall be
paid to the recordholder thereof,  without interest, (i) promptly after such
surrender, the  number of whole shares of IDEC Common Stock issuable in
exchange  therefor pursuant to this _Article II,_ together with  any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of IDEC Common  Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_ and the amount of dividends
or other  distributions with a record date after the Effective Time 
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of IDEC  Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the  amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date  after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such  surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
IDEC  Common Stock.    
      
      |   (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Biogen  Common
Stock._ All shares of IDEC Common Stock issued upon  the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with  the terms of this _Article II_
and any cash paid  pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ or  _Section 2.2(c)_ shall
be deemed to have been issued  (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the  shares of Biogen Common Stock previously represented by
such  Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of 
Biogen shall be closed and there shall be no further  registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the  Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Biogen Common Stock which  were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If,  after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the  Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they 
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article II_.    
      
      |   (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any  portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the  holders of Certificates one
year after the Effective Time shall  be delivered to IDEC, upon demand, and
any holders of  Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this 
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to IDEC for  payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration, any cash in  lieu of fractional shares of IDEC
Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or
distributions  pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.    
      
      |   (f) _No Liability._ None of IDEC,  Merger Sub, Biogen
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any  Person in respect of any shares
of IDEC Common Stock (or  dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from  the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any 
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any  Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years  after the Effective
Time, or immediately prior to such earlier  date on which any shares of IDEC
Common Stock, any cash in lieu  of fractional shares of IDEC Common Stock or
any dividends or  distributions with respect to IDEC Common Stock issuable
in  respect of    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or  become the
property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in  _Section 3.1(c)(v)_),
any such shares, cash, dividends  or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the  extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of the  Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest  of any Person previously entitled thereto.    
      
      |   (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The  Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange  Fund as directed by IDEC on a
daily basis _provided_ that  no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts  payable to former stockholders of Biogen after the Effective 
Time pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and  other income resulting
from such investment shall become a part  of the Exchange Fund, and any
amounts in excess of the amounts  payable pursuant to this _Article II_
shall promptly  be paid to IDEC.    
      
      |   (h) _Withholding Rights._ IDEC or the  Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any  consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person  who was a holder of Biogen Common
Stock immediately prior to the  Effective Time such amounts as IDEC or the
Exchange Agent may be  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of  such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, 
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so  withheld by IDEC
or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having  been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would  otherwise have been paid.    
      
      |   (i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed  Certificates._ In the
event any Certificates shall have been  lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in  exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon  the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof,  such shares of IDEC Common Stock as may be required pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(a)_, cash for fractional shares pursuant  to _Section 2.1(e)_
and any dividends or distributions  payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_;
_provided,  however,_ that IDEC may, in its discretion and as a condition 
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such  lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement  of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to IDEC, or a  bond in such sum as IDEC may
reasonably direct as indemnity,  against any claim that may be made against
IDEC or the Exchange  Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have
been lost,  stolen or destroyed.

Charter Documents; Subsidiaries._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) _Organization, Standing and Corporate  Power._
Biogen and each of its Subsidiaries (as defined in  _Section 8.3(p)_) is a
corporation or other legal  entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing  (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) 
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated  or otherwise
organized, and has the requisite corporate (or  similar) power and authority
to carry on its business as  currently conducted, except for those
jurisdictions in which the  failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing would  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely
to  have a Material Adverse Effect (as    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   defined in _Section 8.3(l)_) on Biogen.  Each of Biogen and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or  licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to  jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in
each jurisdiction  in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or  operation of its properties makes such qualification or 
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the  failure to be
so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing  would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Biogen.    
      
      |   (ii) _Charter Documents._ Biogen has  delivered or made
available to IDEC prior to the execution of  this Agreement complete and

Biogen Significant  Subsidiaries (as defined in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_), as 
amended and currently in effect (collectively, the  _"Biogen Subsidiary
Organizational Documents"_ ),  and each such instrument is in full force and
effect. Biogen is  not in violation of the Biogen Organizational Documents
and no  Biogen Significant Subsidiary is in violation of its Biogen 
Subsidiary Organizational Documents, except, in the case of such  Biogen
Significant Subsidiary, as would not reasonably be likely  to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Biogen.    
      
      |   (iii) _ Subsidiaries._  _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ of the
Biogen Disclosure  Schedule lists all the Subsidiaries of Biogen which as of
the  date of this Agreement are significant subsidiaries (as defined  in

outstanding shares of capital  stock of, or other equity interests in, each
Biogen Significant  Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid

interests).

---|--- 
      |   (i) _Benefit Plans._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) With respect to each bonus, pension,  profit
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,  stock ownership,
stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock,  stock-related or performance
award, retirement, vacation,  severance, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical,  loan, fringe benefit, disability, sabbatical and
other similar  plan, arrangement or understanding, including, without 
limitation, each "employee benefit plan" within the  meaning of Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974, as amended
_("ERISA")_ and  any employment agreement, consulting agreement or
severance  agreement (such plans, agreements, arrangements or 
understandings, collectively, _"Benefit Plans"_ )  with or for the benefit of
any current or former employee,  officer or director of Biogen or any of its
Subsidiaries or  ERISA Affiliates (as defined in _Section 3.1(i)(vi)_) 
(the _"Biogen Benefit Plans"_ ), no event has  occurred and there exists no
condition or set of circumstances,  which could reasonably be likely to have
a Material Adverse  Effect on Biogen under ERISA, the Code or any other
Applicable  Law.    
      
      |   (ii) Each Biogen Benefit Plan has been, in  all material
respects, administered and operated in accordance  with its terms, with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the  Code and other Applicable Law and the
terms of all applicable  collective bargaining agreements. Each Biogen
Benefit Plan,  including any material amendments thereto, that is capable
of  approval by, or registration or qualification for special tax  status
with, the appropriate taxation, social security or  supervisory authorities
in the relevant country, state,  territory or the like (each, an _"Approval"_
) has  received such Approval (or there remains a period of time in  which
to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any  material amendment
that has not previously received such    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Approval) and no event has occurred which would  be
reasonably likely to result in the revocation of such  Approval or the
imposition of material sanctions by such  authorities.    
      
      |   (iii) To the Knowledge of Biogen, no oral or  written
representation or commitment with respect to any  material aspect of any
Biogen Benefit Plan has been made to an  employee or former employee of
Biogen or any of its Subsidiaries  by an authorized Biogen employee that is
not materially in  accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms
and  provisions of such Biogen Benefit Plans. To the Knowledge of  Biogen,
neither Biogen nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered  into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding, whether  written or oral, with any trade union,
works council or other  employee representative body or any material number
or category  of its employees which would prevent, restrict or materially 
impede the implementation of any lay-off, redundancy, severance  or similar
program within its or their respective workforces (or  any part of them). 
  
      
      |   (iv) There are no material unresolved claims  or
disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any  Biogen Benefit Plan
(other than routine undisputed claims for  benefits), and no action, legal or
otherwise, has been commenced  or threatened with respect to any material
claim or otherwise in  connection with a Biogen Benefit Plan.    
      
      |   (v) With respect to each Funded Retirement  Plan (as
defined below) of Biogen or its Subsidiaries, the  aggregate value of the
assets of such Funded Retirement Plan is  equal to or greater than the
aggregate value of its liabilities  assessed on an ongoing and terminated
basis and calculated in  accordance with the actuarial methods and
assumptions used in  such valuation pursuant to such Funded Retirement Plan
and  Applicable Law and GAAP. For purposes of this Agreement,  _"Funded
Retirement Plan"_ means, with respect to  a party, a Benefit Plan that is a
"pension plan"  within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not 
such Benefit Plan is subject to ERISA) and under which the  assets to satisfy
the benefit obligations are legally segregated  from the general assets of
such party or its Subsidiaries and  are not subject to the creditors of such
party or its  Subsidiaries. None of Biogen or any other person or entity
under  common control within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c),  (m) or (o)
of the Code (an _"ERISA  Affiliate"_ ) with Biogen has incurred any liability
to a  Funded Retirement Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than for 
contributions not yet due) or to the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation
(other than for payment of premiums not yet due)  that, when aggregated with
other such liabilities, would result  in a material liability of Biogen and
its Subsidiaries taken as  a whole, which liability has not been fully
paid.    
      
      |   (vi) At no time has Biogen or any ERISA  Affiliate of
Biogen participated in and/or been obligated to  contribute to any Benefit
Plan that is a "multiemployer  plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA.    
      
      |   (vii) No Biogen Benefit Plan provides health  benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to employees or  former employees of
Biogen or any Subsidiary of Biogen after  retirement or other termination of
service (other than coverage  mandated by Applicable Law or benefits, the
full cost of which  is borne by the employee or former employee).    
      
      |   (viii) Neither the negotiation and execution  of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of  any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under  any Biogen Benefit Plan that will or may result in
any payment  (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of 
payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,  increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect  to any employee or
former employee of Biogen or any Subsidiary  of Biogen. There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement  with an employee or former employee of Biogen
to which Biogen or  any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of
this  Agreement, that, individually or collectively and as a result of  the
transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the  occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) or otherwise,  would reasonably be likely ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   give rise to the payment of any amount that would  not be
deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of  the Code.

predecessors thereof, has (A) duly and timely  filed (or there have been

be filed by it (taking  into account all applicable extensions) with the
appropriate Tax  Authority (as defined below) and all such Tax Returns are
true,  correct and complete in all material respects, (B) duly  paid in full
or made provision in accordance with GAAP (or there  has been paid or
provision has been made on its behalf) for the  payment of all material Taxes
for all periods ending through the  date hereof, and (C) complied in all
material respects with  all Applicable Laws relating to the payment and
withholding of  Taxes.    
      
      |   (ii) There are no material Liens for Taxes  upon any

contained in  the Biogen SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this 
Agreement.    
      
      |   (iii) The unpaid Taxes of Biogen and its  Subsidiaries
(A) did not, as of the most recent financial  statements contained in the
Biogen SEC Documents filed prior to  the date of this Agreement, exceed the

established to  reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set 
forth on the face of such financial statements (rather than in  any notes
thereto), and (B) do not exceed that reserve as  adjusted for the passage of
time since the date of such  financial statements in accordance with the past
custom and  practice of Biogen and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax 
Returns.    
      
      |   (iv) There is no audit, examination,  deficiency, refund
litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in  controversy with respect to any
Taxes or Tax Return of Biogen or  its Subsidiaries which if determined
adversely would be expected  to result in a material Tax deficiency. Neither
Biogen nor any  of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any claim made by
a  governmental authority in a jurisdiction where Biogen or any of  its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not file a Tax Return,  that Biogen or such
Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation  by that jurisdiction.    
      
      |   (v) The material income Tax Returns of  Biogen and each
of its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors  thereof, have been examined
by the applicable Tax Authority (or  the applicable statutes of limitations
for the assessment of  income Taxes for such periods have expired) for all
periods  through and including December 31, 1997, and no material 
deficiencies were asserted as a result of such examinations  which have not
been resolved and fully paid or accrued as a  liability on the most recent
financial statements contained in  the Biogen SEC Documents.    
      
      |   (vi) There are no outstanding requests,  agreements,
consents or waivers to extend the statutory period  of limitations applicable
to the assessment of any Taxes or  deficiencies against Biogen or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no  power of attorney granted by either Biogen or any of
its  Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes is currently in force.    
      
      |   (vii) Neither Biogen nor any of its  Subsidiaries is a
party to any agreement providing for the  allocation or sharing of Taxes
imposed on or with respect to any  individual or other Person, and neither
Biogen nor any of its  Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated
group  (or similar state, local or foreign filing group) filing a 
consolidated income Tax Return (other than the group the common  parent of
which is Biogen) or (B) has any liability for the  Taxes of any Person (other
than Biogen or any of its  Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6
(or  any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a  transferee
or successor, by contract, or otherwise.    
      
      |   (viii) Biogen and each of its Subsidiaries  has
delivered or made available to IDEC complete copies of all  material income
Tax Returns of Biogen and each of its  Subsidiaries, including any    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   predecessors thereof, for taxable years ending  between
January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2002,  excepting such Tax Returns as have
not been filed for the  taxable year ending December 31, 2002 pursuant to 
appropriate extensions with respect thereto.    
      
      |   (ix) Neither Biogen nor any of its  Subsidiaries has:
(A) filed a consent under Section 341(f)  of the Code concerning collapsible
corporations; (B) agreed  to make nor is it required to make any material
adjustment under  Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in 
accounting method or otherwise; (C) constituted either a  "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled  corporation" (within the meaning of  Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of  stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under Section 355  of the Code (I) in the two years prior to the
date of this  Agreement or (II) in a distribution which could otherwise 
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related  transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of  the Code) in connection with the Merger; or (D)
taken any  action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other 
circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger  from qualifying
as a "reorganization" within the  meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.    
      
      |   (x) Neither Biogen nor any of its  Subsidiaries is, or
has been, a United States real property  holding corporation (as defined in
Section 897(c)(2) of the  Code) during the applicable period specified in 
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.    
      
      |   (xi) For purposes of this Agreement,  _"Audit"_ means
any examination, audit,  assessment, action, proceeding, investigation,
dispute or claim  with respect to Taxes by any Tax Authority or any
administrative  or judicial proceedings or appeals of such proceedings
relating  to Taxes; _"Taxes"_ means any and all federal,  state, local,

jurisdictions  which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which
the  nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of  its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,  except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so  qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing would not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a  Material Adverse Effect on IDEC.

instrument is in full force and effect. IDEC is not in violation  of the IDEC
Organizational Documents and no IDEC Significant  Subsidiary is in violation
of its IDEC    ##### 

        |

in, each IDEC Significant Subsidiary have been validly  issued and are fully

respective  properties or assets, other than, in the case of  clauses (B)
and (C), any such conflicts, violations,  defaults, rights, losses,
restrictions or Liens, or failure to  obtain consents, waivers or approvals,

complied in all material respects with the  requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the  case may be, and the rules and regulations
of the SEC  promulgated thereunder applicable to such IDEC SEC Documents, 
and none of the IDEC SEC Documents, when filed, contained any  untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a  material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in  order to make the statements therein, in
light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except  to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed IDEC SEC  Document
filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof.    
      
      |   (ii) The financial statements of IDEC  included in the
IDEC SEC Documents, including each IDEC SEC  Document filed after the date
hereof until the Effective Time,  comply, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in  all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements  and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect  thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in 
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q  or 8-K of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the  periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes  thereto) and fairly present the consolidated
financial position  of IDEC and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the

consolidated Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, other than  (A)
liabilities and obligations incurred since  March 31, 2003 in the ordinary
course of business  consistent with past practice which would not reasonably
be  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on IDEC and  (B) liabilities

transactions contemplated hereby.

      |   relationship between or among IDEC and any of its 
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,  including
without limitation any structured finance, special  purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand),  where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such contract or  arrangement is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction  involving, or material liabilities of, IDEC or any
of its  Subsidiaries in IDECs or its Subsidiaries published  financial
statements.    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (e) _Information Supplied._ None of the  information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of IDEC  or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in  (i) the Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4  becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact 
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein
not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy  Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to IDECs  stockholders or at the time of the IDEC
Stockholders  Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit  to state any material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of  the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The  Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4 will comply as to  form in all material respects with the requirements of
the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations
thereunder, except that no representation or  warranty is made by IDEC with
respect to information or  statements with respect to Biogen or its
Subsidiaries made or  incorporated by reference therein supplied by or on
behalf of  Biogen for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint 
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4.

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) Since December 31, 2002 through the  date hereof,
except as and to the extent disclosed in the IDEC  SEC Documents filed prior
to the date of this Agreement:    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (A) IDEC and its Subsidiaries have conducted  their
business only in the ordinary course consistent with past  practice;    
      
      |   (B) there has not been any split,  combination or
reclassification of any of IDECs capital  stock or any declaration, setting

shares of IDECs capital stock;    
      
      |   (C) except as required by a change in GAAP,  there has

      |   (D) there has not been any action taken by  IDEC or any
of its Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period  from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time,  would constitute a breach of _Section
4.1(b)_, other  than actions in connection with entering into this
Agreement.    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (ii) Since December 31, 2002 through  the date hereof,

thereunder)  which are required for the operation of the businesses of IDEC 
and its Subsidiaries in the manner described in the IDEC SEC  Documents filed
prior to the date hereof or as they are being  conducted as of the date
hereof (the _"IDEC  Permits"_ ), and all IDEC Permits are in full force and 
effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or  cancellation
of, or the failure to be valid or in full force and  effect of, any such IDEC
Permits individually or in the  aggregate would not reasonably be likely to
have a Material  Adverse Effect on IDEC. As of the    #####

with the terms of the IDEC Permits and all Applicable  Laws relating to IDEC
and its Subsidiaries or their respective  business or properties, except
where the failure to be in  compliance with the terms of the IDEC Permits or

Material Adverse Effect on IDEC  or Merger Sub.

its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order,  injunction or decree
which, individually or in the aggregate,  has had or would reasonably be

        |

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) As of the date hereof, except as would  not,

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (ii) As of the date hereof,    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (A) neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries  is a party
to, or otherwise bound by, any collective bargaining  agreement or any other
agreement with a labor union or labor  organization, nor is any such
agreement presently being  negotiated;    
      
      |   (B) no labor organization or group of  employees of IDEC
or any of its Subsidiaries has made a pending  demand for recognition or
certification, and there are no  representation or certification proceedings
or petitions seeking  a representation proceeding presently pending or, to
the  Knowledge of IDEC, threatened to be brought or filed with the  National
Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations  tribunal or authority;
and    
      
      |   (C) to the Knowledge of IDEC, no labor union  is seeking
to organize any employees of IDEC or any of its  Subsidiaries.    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) _Benefit Plans._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) With respect to each Benefit Plan with  or for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer or  director of IDEC or
any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates  (the _"IDEC Benefit Plans"_ ),
no event has  occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances,  which could reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse 
Effect on IDEC under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law.    
      
      |   (ii) Each IDEC Benefit Plan has been, in all  material
respects, administered and operated in accordance with  its terms, with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and  other Applicable Law and the
terms of all applicable collective  bargaining agreements. Each IDEC Benefit
Plan, including any  material amendments thereto, that is capable of Approval
has  received such Approval (or there remains a period of time in  which to
obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any  material amendment that
has not previously received such  Approval) and no event has occurred which
would be reasonably  likely to result in the revocation of such Approval or
the  imposition of material sanctions by such authorities.    
      
      |   (iii) To the Knowledge of IDEC, no oral or  written
representation or commitment with respect to any  material aspect of any IDEC
Benefit Plan has been made to an  employee or former employee of IDEC or any
of its Subsidiaries  by an authorized IDEC employee that is not materially
in  accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and 
provisions of such IDEC Benefit Plans. To the Knowledge of IDEC,  neither
IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any  agreement, arrangement
or understanding, whether written or  oral, with any trade union, works
council or other employee  representative body or any material number or
category of its  employees which would prevent, restrict or materially impede
the  implementation of any lay-off, redundancy, severance or similar 
program within its or their respective workforces (or any part  of them). 
  
      
      |   (iv) There are no material unresolved claims  or
disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any IDEC  Benefit Plan
(other than routine undisputed claims for  benefits), and no action, legal or
otherwise, has been commenced  or threatened with respect to any material
claim or otherwise in  connection with an IDEC Benefit Plan.    
      
      |   (v) With respect to each Funded Retirement  Plan of IDEC
or its Subsidiaries, the aggregate value of the  assets of such Funded
Retirement Plan is equal to or greater  than the aggregate value of its
liabilities assessed on an  ongoing and terminated basis and calculated in
accordance with  the actuarial methods and assumptions used in such
valuation  pursuant to such Funded Retirement Plan and Applicable Law and 
GAAP. None of IDEC or any ERISA Affiliate of IDEC has incurred  any liability
to a Funded Retirement Plan under Title IV of  ERISA (other than for
contributions not yet due) or to the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(other than for payment of  premiums not yet due) that, when aggregated with
other    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   such liabilities, would result in a material  liability of
IDEC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which  liability has not been
fully paid.    
      
      |   (vi) At no time has IDEC or any ERISA  Affiliate of IDEC
participated in and/or been obligated to  contribute to any Benefit Plan that
is a "multiemployer  plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.    
      
      |   (vii) No IDEC Benefit Plan provides health  benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to employees or  former employees of
IDEC or any Subsidiary of IDEC after  retirement or other termination of
service (other than coverage  mandated by Applicable Law or benefits, the
full cost of which  is borne by the employee or former employee).    
      
      |   (viii) Neither the negotiation and execution  of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of  any additional or subsequent events)
constitute an event under  any IDEC Benefit Plan that will or may result in
any payment  (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of 
payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,  increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect  to any employee or
former employee of IDEC or any Subsidiary of  IDEC. There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement with  an employee or former employee of IDEC
to which IDEC or any of  its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this
Agreement,  that, individually or collectively and as a result of the 
transaction contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the  occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) or otherwise,  would reasonably be likely to
give rise to the payment of any  amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to  Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (j) _Taxes._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) Each of IDEC and its Subsidiaries,  including any
predecessors thereof, has (A) duly and timely  filed (or there have been
filed on its behalf) all material Tax  Returns required to be filed by it
(taking into account all  applicable extensions) with the appropriate Tax
Authority and  all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all 
material respects, (B) duly paid in full or made provision  in accordance
with GAAP (or there has been paid or provision has  been made on its behalf)
for the payment of all material Taxes  for all periods ending through the
date hereof, and  (C) complied in all material respects with all Applicable 
Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes.    
      
      |   (ii) There are no material Liens for Taxes  upon any
property or assets of IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries,  except for liens for
Taxes not yet due and payable and for which  adequate reserves have been
provided in accordance with GAAP in  the most recent financial statements
contained in the IDEC SEC  Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement.    
      
      |   (iii) The unpaid Taxes of IDEC and its  Subsidiaries (A)
did not, as of the most recent financial  statements contained in the IDEC
SEC Documents filed prior to  the date of this Agreement, exceed the reserve
for Tax liability  (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to  reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set  forth on
the face of such financial statements (rather than in  any notes thereto),
and (B) do not exceed that reserve as  adjusted for the passage of time since
the date of such  financial statements in accordance with the past custom
and  practice of IDEC and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax  Returns. 
  
      
      |   (iv) There is no audit, examination,  deficiency, refund
litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in  controversy with respect to any
Taxes or Tax Return of IDEC or  its Subsidiaries which if determined
adversely would be expected  to result in a material Tax deficiency. Neither
IDEC nor any of  its Subsidiaries has received notice of any claim made by
a  governmental authority in a jurisdiction where IDEC or any of  its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not file a Tax Return,  that IDEC or such
Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by  that jurisdiction.    ##### 

 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (v) The material income Tax Returns of IDEC  and each of
its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors  thereof, have been examined by
the applicable Tax Authority (or  the applicable statutes of limitations for
the assessment of  income Taxes for such periods have expired) for all
periods  through and including December 31, 1997, and no material 
deficiencies were asserted as a result of such examinations  which have not
been resolved and fully paid or accrued as a  liability on the most recent
financial statements contained in  the IDEC SEC Documents.    
      
      |   (vi) There are no outstanding requests,  agreements,
consents or waivers to extend the statutory period  of limitations applicable
to the assessment of any Taxes or  deficiencies against IDEC or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no  power of attorney granted by either IDEC or any of
its  Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes is currently in force.    
      
      |   (vii) Neither IDEC nor any of its  Subsidiaries is a
party to any agreement providing for the  allocation or sharing of Taxes
imposed on or with respect to any  individual or other Person, and neither
IDEC nor any of its  Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated
group  (or similar state, local or foreign filing group) filing a 
consolidated income Tax Return (other than the group the common  parent of
which is IDEC) or (B) has any liability for the  Taxes of any Person (other
than IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries)  under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6
(or any similar  provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee
or  successor, by contract, or otherwise.    
      
      |   (viii) IDEC and each of its Subsidiaries has  delivered
or made available to Biogen complete copies of all  material income Tax
Returns of IDEC and each of its  Subsidiaries, including any predecessors
thereof, for taxable  years ending between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 
2002, excepting such Tax Returns as have not been filed for the  taxable year
ending December 31, 2002 pursuant to  appropriate extensions with respect
thereto.    
      
      |   (ix) Neither IDEC nor any of its  Subsidiaries has: (A)
filed a consent under  Section 341(f) of the Code concerning collapsible 
corporations; (B) agreed to make nor is it required to make  any material
adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by  reason of a change in
accounting method or otherwise;  (C) constituted either a "distributing 
corporation" or a "controlled corporation"  (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in  a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under  Section 355 of the Code (I) in the two years prior to  the
date of this Agreement or (II) in a distribution which  could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or  "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning  of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the  Merger; or
(D) taken any action or knows of any fact,  agreement, plan or other
circumstance that is reasonably likely  to prevent the Merger from qualifying
as a  "reorganization" within the meaning of  Section 368(a) of the Code. 
  
      
      |   (x) Neither IDEC nor any of its Subsidiaries  is, or has
been, a United States real property holding  corporation (as defined in
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code)  during the applicable period specified in 
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

      |   (k) _Regulatory Compliance; Supply._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) All biological and drug products  currently being
manufactured, distributed or developed by IDEC  or its Subsidiaries, or by
any other Person pursuant to a  development, commercialization,
manufacturing, supply or other  collaboration arrangement (other than an
arrangement that is  solely a license to market, distribute or sell products
in a  specified territory) with IDEC or any of its Subsidiaries (any  such
other Person acting under or in respect of such an  arrangement, an _"IDEC
Collaboration Partner"_   and any such an arrangement with IDEC or any of

in this Agreement to the contrary,  _provided_ that Biogen is in material
compliance with  _Section 4.1(c)(viii)_ hereof, no Transaction Event  shall

  SECTION 4.2 _No Solicitation._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Neither Biogen nor IDEC shall, nor  permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, nor authorize or permit any  of its officers, directors
or employees or any investment  banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other  representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries
to,  directly, or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage  (including
by way of furnishing any information), or take any  other action to, or which
would be reasonably likely to,  facilitate, induce or encourage, any
inquiries with respect to,  or the making, submission or announcement of, any
Alternative  Transaction Proposal (as defined in _Section 8.3(c)_),  (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations  regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect  to, any, or any possible, Alternative

this  _Section 4.2_), (iii) approve, endorse or  recommend any Alternative
Transaction (except to the extent  specifically permitted pursuant to
_Section 4.2(d)_),  or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar
document  or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or 
otherwise relating to any possible or proposed Alternative  Transaction
Proposal. Each of Biogen and IDEC and each of their  respective Subsidiaries
will immediately cease, and will cause  its officers, directors and employees
and any investment banker,  financial adviser, attorney, accountant or other
representative  retained by it to cease, any and all existing activities, 
discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted  heretofore with
respect to any possible or proposed Alternative  Transaction, and will use
its best efforts to enforce (and not  waive any provisions of) any
confidentiality and standstill  agreement (or any similar agreement) relating
to any such  possible or proposed Alternative Transaction.    
      
      |   (b) _Notification of Alternative  Transactions._ As
promptly as practicable (and in any event  within twenty-four (24) hours)
after receipt of any  Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for
nonpublic  information or any inquiry relating in any way to any, or any 
possible, Alternative Transaction Proposal, Biogen or IDEC, as  the case may
be, shall provide the other party with oral and  written notice of the
material terms and conditions of such  Alternative Transaction Proposal,
request or inquiry, and the  identity of the Person or group making any such
Alternative  Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all 
written materials provided to it in connection with such  Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In  addition, Biogen or IDEC, as
the case may be, shall provide the  other party as promptly as practicable
with oral and written  notice setting forth all such information as is
reasonably  necessary to keep the other party informed in all material 
respects of all oral or written communications regarding, and  the status and
details (including material amendments or  proposed material amendments) of,
any such Alternative  Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and,
without  limitation of the other provisions of this  _Section 4.2_, shall
promptly provide to the other  party a copy of all written materials
(including written  materials provided by email or otherwise in electronic
format)  subsequently provided by or to it in connection with such 
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. Biogen or  IDEC, as the
case may be, shall provide the other party with  forty-eight (48) hours prior
notice (or such lesser prior  notice as is provided to the members of its
Board of Directors)  of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its
Board of  Directors is reasonably likely to consider any Alternative 
Transaction Proposal or Alternative Transaction.    
      
      |   (c) _Superior Proposals._   Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in  _Section 4.2(a)_, in the event that Biogen or
IDEC, as  the case may be, receives an unsolicited, bona fide written 
Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined (in  accordance with
_Section 8.3(q)_) to be a    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Superior Proposal (as defined in  _Section 8.3(q)_), it may
then take the following  actions (but only (1) if and to the extent that 
(x) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after  receipt of advice
of its outside legal counsel, that the failure  to do so is reasonably likely
to result in a breach of its  fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under
Applicable Law,  _and_ (y) Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, has  given
the other party at least one business day prior written  notice of its
intention to take any of the following actions and  of the identity of the
Person or group making such Superior  Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Superior  Proposal and (2) if it shall not have breached
in any  material respect any of the provisions of this  _Section 4.2_): 
  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) Furnish nonpublic information to the  Person or
group making such Superior Proposal, _provided_   that (A) prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic  information, it receives from such Person or
group an executed  confidentiality and standstill agreement containing terms
at  least as restrictive as the terms contained in the  Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of February 11, 2003,  between IDEC and Biogen (the
_"CDA"_ ) and (B)  contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information  to such Person or group, it furnishes such nonpublic
information  to the other party hereto (to the extent such nonpublic 
information has not been previously so furnished to such party);  and    
      
      |   (ii) Engage in negotiations with such Person  or group
with respect to such Superior Proposal.    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (d) _Changes of Recommendation._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) In response to the receipt of an  unsolicited, bona
fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal  which is determined (in
accordance with  _Section 8.3(q)_) to be a Superior Proposal, the Board  of
Directors of Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, may  withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify its recommendation in favor  of, in the case of Biogen,
approval and adoption of this  Agreement and the Merger and, in the case of
IDEC, the IDEC  Charter Amendment and the Share Issuance, and, in the case of
a  Superior Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made  directly to
its stockholders, may recommend that its  stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer (any of the  foregoing actions, whether by a Board of
Directors or a  committee thereof, a _"Change of  Recommendation"_ ), if all
of the following conditions in  clauses (1) through (5) are met:    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (1) The Superior Proposal has been made and  has not
been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal;    
      
      |   (2) The Biogen Stockholders Meeting or  IDEC
Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, has not  occurred;    
      
      |   (3) Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be, has  (A)
provided to the other party hereto five  (5) business days prior written
notice which shall  state expressly (x) that it has received a Superior 
Proposal, (y) the material terms and conditions of the  Superior Proposal and
the identity of the Person or group making  the Superior Proposal, and (z)
that it intends to effect a  Change of Recommendation and the manner in which
it intends to  do so, (B) provided to the other party hereto a copy of all 
written materials delivered to the Person or group making the  Superior
Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal,  (C) made available to
the other party hereto all materials  and information made available to the
Person or group making the  Superior Proposal in connection with such
Superior Proposal, and  (D) during such five business day period, if
requested by  the other party hereto, engaged in good faith negotiations to 
amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative  Transaction
Proposal which was determined to be a Superior  Proposal no longer is a
Superior Proposal;    
      
      |   (4) The Board of Directors of Biogen or  IDEC, as the
case may be, has concluded in good faith, after  receipt of advice of its
outside legal counsel, that, in light  of such Superior Proposal, the failure
of the Board of Directors  to effect a Change of Recommendation is    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   reasonably likely to result in a breach of its  fiduciary
obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law;  and    
      
      |   (5) Biogen or IDEC, as the case may be,  shall have
complied with _Section 4.2(c)_ and shall  not have breached in any material
respect any of the other  provisions set forth in this _Section 4.2_ or in 
_Sections 5.1(b)_ through _5.1(d)._     
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (ii) Without limiting the foregoing,  (1) provided no
possible or proposed Alternative  Transaction Proposal involving Biogen has
been made public or is  known to the Board of Directors or senior executives
of Biogen,  the Board of Directors of Biogen may effect a Change of 
Recommendation (but only insofar as the same involves  withholding,
withdrawing, amending or modifying its  recommendation in favor of the Merger
and no action with respect  to or in connection with any Alternative
Transaction Proposal),  so long as (x) a Material Adverse Change (as defined
in  _Section 8.3(l)_) of IDEC shall have occurred since  the date of this
Agreement and be continuing and (y) Biogen  shall not have breached in any
material respect any of the  provisions set forth in this _Section 4.2_ or 
_Section 5.1_; and (2) provided no possible or  proposed Alternative
Transaction Proposal involving IDEC has  been made public or is known to the
Board of Directors or senior  executives of IDEC, the Board of Directors of
IDEC may implement  a Change of Recommendation (but only insofar as the
same  involves withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its 
recommendation in favor of the Merger and no action with respect  to or in
connection with any Alternative Transaction Proposal),  so long as (x) a
Material Adverse Change of Biogen shall  have occurred since the date of this
Agreement and be continuing  and (y) IDEC shall not have breached in any
material  respect any of the provisions set forth in this  _Section 4.2_ or
_Section 5.1._    
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (e) In the event a Superior Proposal that is  a tender
offer or exchange offer is made to the stockholders of  IDEC or Biogen and
the Board of Directors thereof has made a  Change of Recommendation, the
other party hereto shall be  released from the obligations set forth in
Section 2.9 or  3.9, respectively, of the CDA.    
      
      |   (f) _Continuing Obligation to Hold  Stockholders 
Meeting; No Other Vote._ Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the  obligation of Biogen or IDEC to call, give notice of,
convene  and hold the Biogen Stockholders Meeting or the IDEC 
Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, shall not be  limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure,  announcement or submission to it
of any Alternative Transaction  Proposal with respect to it, or by any Change
of Recommendation.  Neither Biogen nor IDEC shall submit to the vote of its 
respective stockholders any Alternative Transaction, whether or  not a
Superior Proposal, or propose to do so.    
      
      |   (g) _Compliance with Tender Offer  Rules._ Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit  Biogen or IDEC or their
respective Boards of Directors from  taking and disclosing to their
stockholders a position  contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under  the Exchange Act; _provided_ that neither Biogen nor IDEC  shall
effect, or disclose pursuant to such Rules or otherwise a  position which
constitutes, a Change of Recommendation unless  specifically permitted
pursuant to the terms of  _Section 4.2(d)._    
    

 ARTICLE V  

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  

  SECTION 5.1 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings._  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) As soon as practicable following the  date of this
Agreement, IDEC and Biogen shall prepare and file  with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement, and IDEC shall prepare  and file with the SEC the Form S-4,
in which the Joint  Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
IDEC  and    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Biogen shall use commercially reasonable efforts  to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the  Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing.  IDEC will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the  Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to IDECs
stockholders,  and Biogen will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause  the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Biogens  stockholders, in
each case as promptly as practicable after the  Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act.  IDEC shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do  business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified  or to file a general consent to service of process) required to 
be taken under any applicable state securities laws in  connection with the
issuance of shares of IDEC Common Stock in  the Merger and the conversion of
Biogen Options into options to  acquire IDEC Common Stock, and Biogen shall
furnish all  information concerning Biogen and the holders of Biogen Common 
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such  action. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the  Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement will be made by IDEC  without Biogens prior consent (which shall
not be  unreasonably withheld) and without providing Biogen the  opportunity
to review and comment thereon. IDEC will advise  Biogen promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time  when the Form S-4 has become effective
or any supplement or  amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the  suspension of the qualification of the IDEC Common Stock 
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in  any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the  Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon  and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional  information. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any  information (including any Change of Recommendation)
relating to  IDEC or Biogen, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers  or directors, should be discovered by IDEC or Biogen which  should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the  Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such  documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact  or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such  information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and  an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such  information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the  extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of
IDEC  and Biogen.    
      
      |   (b) Each of Biogen and IDEC shall, as  promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared  effective under the Securities
Act, take all action necessary in  accordance with Applicable Law and the
Biogen Organizational  Documents, in the case of Biogen, and the IDEC
Organizational  Documents, in the case of IDEC, to duly give notice of,
convene  and hold a meeting of its stockholders to be held as promptly as 
practicable to consider, in the case of IDEC, the Share  Issuance, the IDEC
Charter Amendment and approval of the New  IDEC Stock Plan (as defined in
_Section 8.3(n)_) and  the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan (as defined in 
_Section 8.3(m)_) (the _"IDEC  Stockholders  Meeting"_) and, in the case
of  Biogen, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the  Merger (the
_"Biogen Stockholders   Meeting"_). Subject to _Section 4.2(d)_, each  of
Biogen and IDEC will use all commercially reasonable efforts  to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of, in the  case of IDEC, the Share
Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and  approval of the New IDEC Stock Plan
and the New IDEC Annual  Bonus Plan, and, in the case of Biogen, the adoption
and  approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and will take all  other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or  consent of its
stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq  National Market or
Applicable Law to obtain such approvals.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this  Agreement, Biogen or IDEC may adjourn or postpone
the Biogen  Stockholders Meeting or IDEC Stockholders Meeting,  as the
case may be, to the extent necessary to ensure that any  necessary supplement
or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement  is provided to its respective
stockholders in advance of a vote  on, in the case of IDEC, the Share
Issuance, the IDEC Charter  Amendment and approval of the New IDEC Stock Plan
and the New  IDEC Annual Bonus Plan, and, in the case of Biogen, the
approval  and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, or, if, as of the 
time for which the Biogen Stockholders Meeting or IDEC  Stockholders
Meeting, as the case may be, is originally  scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Biogen Common Stock  or IDEC Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in  person or by proxy) to constitute a    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   quorum necessary to conduct the business of such  meeting.
Each of Biogen and IDEC shall ensure that the Biogen  Stockholders Meeting
and the IDEC Stockholders  Meeting, respectively, is called, noticed,
convened, held and  conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection
with the  Biogen Stockholders Meeting or IDEC Stockholders  Meeting, as
the case may be, are solicited in compliance with  Applicable Law, the rules
of the Nasdaq National Market and, in  the case of Biogen, the Biogen
Organizational Documents, and, in  the case of IDEC, the IDEC Organizational
Documents. Without the  prior written consent of Biogen, the IDEC Charter
Amendment, the  Share Issuance and approval and adoption of the New IDEC
Stock  Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan are the only matters  which
IDEC shall propose to be acted on by IDECs  stockholders at the IDEC
Stockholders Meeting. Without the  prior written consent of IDEC, approval
and adoption of this  Agreement and the Merger is the only matter which
Biogen shall  propose to be acted on by Biogens stockholders at the  Biogen
Stockholders Meeting.    
      
      |   (c) Each of Biogen and IDEC will use  commercially
reasonable efforts to hold the Biogen  Stockholders Meeting and IDEC
Stockholders Meeting,  respectively, on the same date as the other party and
as soon as  reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.    
      
      |   (d) Except to the extent expressly permitted  by
_Section 4.2(d)_: (i) the Board of Directors  of each of Biogen and IDEC
shall recommend that its stockholders  vote in favor of, in the case of
Biogen, the approval and  adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the
Biogen  Stockholders Meeting, and, in the case of IDEC, the Share 
Issuance, the IDEC Charter Amendment and approval and adoption  of the New
IDEC Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual Bonus Plan at  the IDEC Stockholders
Meetings, (ii) the Joint Proxy  Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Board  of Directors of (A) IDEC has recommended that IDECs 
stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance, the IDEC  Charter Amendment
and approval and adoption of the New IDEC  Stock Plan and the New IDEC Annual
Bonus Plan at the IDEC  Stockholders Meeting and (B) Biogen has

  SECTION 5.4 _Reasonable Efforts._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the  conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties  agrees to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or  cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done,  and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all  things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make  effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the  Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary  actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from  Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary 
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be  necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an  action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, including all  filings required by the HSR Act (the
initial filing required by  the HSR Act to be filed promptly within the
meaning of the HSR  Act) and any applicable antitrust, competition or similar
laws  of any foreign jurisdiction, (ii) the obtaining of all  necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,  (iii) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal  proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging  this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

temporary restraining order entered by any court or  other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the  execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary  to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully  carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Subject to
Applicable  Laws relating to the exchange of information and in addition to 
_Section 5.4(b)_, Biogen and IDEC shall have the right  to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will  consult the other on, all
the information relating to Biogen and  its Subsidiaries or IDEC and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may  be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials  submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in  connection with the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement.    
      
      |   (b) Each of IDEC and Biogen shall keep the  other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to  the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby and work  cooperatively in connection
with obtaining all required  approvals or consents of any Governmental Entity
(whether  domestic, foreign or supranational). In that regard, each party 
shall without limitation: (i) promptly notify the other of,  and if in
writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the  case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally  of) any communications from or with
any Governmental Entity  (whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with
respect to the  Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in  advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other in  connection with, any
proposed written (or any material proposed  oral) communication with any such
Governmental Entity,  (iii) not participate in any meeting with any such 
Governmental Entity unless it consults with the other in advance  and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity gives  the other the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat,  (iv) furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence,  filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the  substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity  with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and  (v) furnish the other with
such necessary information and  reasonable assistance as IDEC or Biogen may
reasonably request  in connection with its preparation of necessary filings
or  submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity. Each  of
IDEC and Biogen may, as each deems advisable and necessary,  reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material  provided to the other under
this _Section 5.4_ as  "outside counsel only." Such material and the 
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside  legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such  outside counsel

that no state takeover statute or similar  statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement  or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) if  any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation  becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions 
contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that  such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable  on the terms
required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and  otherwise to minimize
the effect of such statute or regulation  on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.    
    

  SECTION 5.5 _Indemnification and Insurance._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) From and after the Effective Time, IDEC  will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and  honor in all respects
the obligations of Biogen pursuant to any  indemnification agreements between

The articles of organization and by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation  and indemnification that are
at least as favorable to the  Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Biogen Charter and  the Biogen By-laws as in effect on the date hereof,
which  provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified  for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner  that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals  who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, were directors,  officers, employees or agents of
Biogen, unless such  modification is required by law.    
      
      |   (b) For a period of six years after the  Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be  maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and  officers and fiduciary liability insurance

containing terms and conditions which are no less  advantageous to former
officers and directors of Biogen) only  with respect to claims arising from
facts or events which  occurred at or before the Effective Time.

any such press release or make any such public  statement prior to such
consultation, except as either party may  determine is required by Applicable

the parties.    
      
      |   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained
in this Agreement or the CDA, the parties (and each  employee, representative
or other agent of the parties) may  disclose to any and all    ##### 

        |

discussions relating to  the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the date
of  public announcement by the parties of the transactions  contemplated
hereby or (iii) the date of the execution of  this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that neither party  (nor any employee, representative or agent
thereof) may disclose  any information that is not necessary to understand
the tax  treatment and tax structure of such transactions (including the 
identity of the parties and any information that could lead  another to
determine the identity of the parties), or any other  information to the
extent that such disclosure could result in a  violation of any Applicable
Law.    
    

  SECTION 5.8 _Listing._  IDEC shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the IDEC Common Stock issuable under _Article II,_ and those shares of IDEC Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger, to be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, upon official notice of issuance.   

  SECTION 5.9 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment._ IDEC and Biogen intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each shall, and shall cause its respective subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither IDEC nor Biogen shall knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, that would be reasonably likely to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   

  SECTION 5.10 _Post-Agreement Operations._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Promptly following execution of this  Agreement, the
parties shall establish a transition planning  team (the _"Transition Team"_
) consisting of an  equal number of representatives of Biogen and IDEC. The 
Transition Team shall be responsible for facilitating a  transition and
integration planning process to ensure the  successful combination of the
operations of Biogen with those of  IDEC. The Transition Team shall be
responsible for developing,  and monitoring the development of, and
deliverables due under,  an action plan for the combination of the
businesses.    
      
      |   (b) The Board of Directors of IDEC shall  take all
actions necessary to cause the appointment, as of the  Effective Time, of the
individuals named on  _Schedule 5.10_ hereto to the respective offices set 
forth therein.    
      
      |   (c) As of the Effective Time, IDEC shall  take all steps
necessary to cause the headquarters and the  principal executive offices of
IDEC to be located in Cambridge,  Massachusetts.    
    

  SECTION 5.11 _Conveyance Taxes._ Biogen and IDEC shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.   

  SECTION 5.12 _Equity Awards and Employee Benefits._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) At the Effective Time, each then  outstanding Biogen
Option, whether or not exercisable at the  Effective Time, will be assumed by
IDEC. Each Biogen Option so  assumed by IDEC under this Agreement will
continue to have, and  be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the  applicable Biogen Option (including any applicable stock option 
agreement or other document evidencing such Biogen Option)  immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any  repurchase rights or vesting
provisions), except that  (i) each Biogen Option will be exercisable (or will
become  exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of  whole
shares of IDEC Common Stock equal to the product of the  number of shares of
Biogen Common Stock that were issuable upon  exercise of such Biogen Option
immediately prior to the  Effective Time (disregarding any vesting schedule
applicable to  such option) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down
to  the nearest whole number of shares of IDEC Common Stock and  (ii) the
per share exercise price for the shares    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   of IDEC Common Stock issuable upon exercise of  such assumed
Biogen Option will be equal to the quotient  determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Biogen  Common Stock of such Biogen Option by the
Exchange Ratio,  rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each assumed Biogen
Option  shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to  the
same percentage of the total number of shares subject  thereto as it was
vested as to immediately prior to the  Effective Time, except to the extent
such Biogen Option (either  by its terms or by the terms of another
agreement) provides for  acceleration of vesting. As soon as reasonably
practicable, IDEC  will issue to each holder of an assumed Biogen Option a
document  evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Biogen Option by 
IDEC. Immediately following the Effective Time, IDEC shall file  a
registration statement under the Securities Act on  Form S-8 or another
appropriate form (and use its  commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness  thereof and maintain the current status of the
prospectuses  contained therein) with respect to the Biogen Options assumed
by  IDEC pursuant hereto and shall cause such registration statement  to
remain in effect for so long as such assumed Biogen Option  remain
outstanding. Prior to the Effective Time, IDEC shall take  all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a  sufficient number of shares of
IDEC Common Stock for delivery in  connection with the exercise of the
converted Biogen Options.  The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to  ensure that the conversion of any Biogen Options which
are  intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined  in Section 422 of
the Code) provided for in this  _Section 5.12(a)_ shall be effected in a
manner  consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.    
      
      |   (b) Biogen shall terminate the Biogen  Purchase Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the  extent any offering period
under the Biogen Purchase Plans is in  progress prior to such termination,
Biogen shall ensure that  such offering period ends immediately prior to such
termination,  and that each participants accumulated contributions for 
such offering period are applied towards the purchase of Biogen  Common Stock
immediately prior to such termination unless the  participant has previously
withdrawn from such offering period  in accordance with the terms of such
plan. Effective as soon as  practicable after the Effective Time, all
Continuing Employees  (as defined in _Section 5.12(c)_) shall be permitted 
to participate in the IDEC Purchase Plan in accordance with the  terms of
such plan.    
      
      |   (c) For one year following the Effective  Time, IDEC
shall provide or cause to be provided to those of its  employees and
employees of the Surviving Corporation or any  other Affiliate of IDEC who
were employees of Biogen immediately  prior to the Effective Time
_("Continuing  Employees"),_ employee welfare benefits that, in the 
aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee welfare  benefits package
provided to those Continuing Employees by  Biogen or a Subsidiary of Biogen
immediately prior to the  execution of this Agreement.    
      
      |   (d) Following the Effective Time, IDEC shall  recognize
(or cause to be recognized) the service of each  Continuing Employee with
Biogen or its Subsidiaries for purposes  of (i) eligibility and vesting under
any IDEC Benefit Plan,  (ii) determination of benefits levels under any
vacation or  severance IDEC Benefit Plan and (iii) determination of 
"retiree" status under any IDEC Benefit Plan, for  which the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible and in which  the Continuing Employee is
offered participation, in each case  except where such crediting would result
in a duplication of  benefits. To the extent IDEC establishes or designates
an IDEC  Benefit Plan to provide group health benefits to Continuing 
Employees, (i) each such IDEC Benefit Plan shall waive  pre-existing
condition limitations with respect to Continuing  Employees to the same
extent waived or no longer applicable  under the applicable group health plan
of Biogen and  (ii) each Continuing Employee shall be given credit under 
the applicable IDEC Benefit Plan for amounts paid under the  corresponding
group health plan of Biogen or an Affiliate during  the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs for purposes of  applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket maximums for  such plan year.    
      
      |   (e) As of the Effective Time, IDEC shall  assume and
agree to perform in accordance with their terms all  employment, severance
and other compensation agreements and  arrangements existing as of the date
hereof, and provided to  IDEC by Biogen prior to the date hereof, between
Biogen or any  Biogen Subsidiary and any director, officer or employee
thereof  and any such agreements or    ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   arrangements entered into after the date hereof  and prior to
the Effective Time by Biogen or any Biogen  Subsidiary in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement.    
      
      |   (f) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the
contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall  be deemed to (i) guarantee
employment for any period of  time for, or preclude the ability of either
party to terminate,  any Continuing Employee for any reason or (ii) require 
either party to continue any IDEC Benefit Plan or Biogen Benefit  Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination  thereof after the
Effective Time.    
    

  SECTION 5.13 _Consents of Accountants._ IDEC and Biogen will each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to each other consents from their respective independent auditors, dated the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective or a date not more than two (2) days prior to such date, in form reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance for consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

Executive  Chairman of the Board of Directors of IDEC or significantly

instructions shall be removed, one year after the Effective Time, upon the
request of any holder of shares of IDEC Common Stock issued in the Merger if
such holder is not then a Rule 145 Affiliate).  

  

  SECTION 5.16 _Notification of Certain Matters._ IDEC shall give prompt notice to Biogen, and Biogen shall give prompt notice to IDEC, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a)(i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of IDEC and the Merger Sub or Biogen, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. In addition, IDEC shall give prompt notice to Biogen and Biogen shall give prompt notice to IDEC of any change or event having, or which would reasonably be likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such party or which would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied.

Biogen  Rights or the IDEC Rights inapplicable to the Merger or any  action
permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the Biogen  Rights Agreement or
the IDEC Rights Agreements unless  (i) required to do so by order of a court
of competent  jurisdiction or (ii) IDECs or Biogens Board of  Directors,
as the case may be, has concluded in good faith,  after receipt of advice of
its outside legal counsel, that, in  light of a Superior Proposal with
respect to it, the failure to  effect such amendment, modification or
termination is reasonably  likely to result in a breach of its Board of
Directors  fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law. 
  
      
      |   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, neither  Biogen nor
IDEC shall take any action to render inapplicable, or  to exempt any third

competent  jurisdiction or (ii) IDECs or Biogens Board of  Directors, as
the case may be, has concluded in good faith,  after receipt of advice of its
outside legal counsel, that, in  light of a Superior Proposal with respect to
it, the failure to  take such action is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of  its Board of Directors fiduciary obligations to its 
stockholders under Applicable Law.    
    

  SECTION 5.19 _Reservation of IDEC Common Stock._ Effective at or prior to the Effective Time, IDEC shall reserve (free from preemptive rights) out of its reserved but unissued shares of IDEC Common Stock, for the purposes of effecting the conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Biogen Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, sufficient shares of IDEC Common Stock to provide for such conversion as well as the issuance of IDEC Common Stock upon the exercise of Biogen Options assumed by IDEC under  _Section 5.12._    #####

Board  of Directors of IDEC shall also, at the time at which it  approves
and adopts the New IDEC Stock Plan, adopt an amendment  to the IDEC 1988
Stock Option Plan, which amendment shall be  conditioned upon both the
occurrence of the Effective Time and  the approval by IDEC stockholders of
the New IDEC Stock Plan,  and which amendment shall provide that after the

  SECTION 8.5 _Interpretation._  When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.   

  SECTION 8.6 _Counterparts._  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.   

  SECTION 8.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement (including the CDA and the documents and instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b) except for the provisions of  _Section 5.5_ (which are    ##### 

  

 intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties, including Indemnified Parties
who or which are not parties hereto), is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.  

  

  SECTION 8.8 _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof, _provided, however,_ that the Merger shall be governed by the MBCL.   

  SECTION 8.9 _Assignment._  Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.   

  SECTION 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court.   

  SECTION 8.11 _Headings, etc._ The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   

  SECTION 8.12 _Severability._  If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.   

  SECTION 8.13 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative._ No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.   

  SECTION 8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF IDEC, MERGER SUB AND BIOGEN HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HERBY OR THE ACTIONS OF IDEC, MERGER SUB OR BIOGEN IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.    ##### 

  

  SECTION 8.15 _Specific Performance._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
