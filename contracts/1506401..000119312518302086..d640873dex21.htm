partnership unit of the Partnership (such units, collectively, the "
_Partnership Units_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (excluding any Partnership Units held by the
Surviving Company or Parent Affiliate) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $21.00

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ and the second and third sentences of
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_. The aggregate amount of cash payable as the Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration is hereinafter referred to as the "

_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(iii)_, as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, all
Partnership Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the
right to receive the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration to be issued or
paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

 

(ii) All limited partnership units of Merger Partnership issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into a number of Partnership Units equal to the

recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any cash dividends permitted by _clause (a)_ of the first
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.12_) or other similar transaction, as
applicable, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Per Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to supersede or in any way

that, as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each LTIP
Unit shall be converted into one Partnership Unit. For the avoidance of doubt,
such Partnership Units issued in respect of such LTIP Units shall be treated
as Partnership Units for purposes of this Agreement and the holders of such
Partnership Units shall be treated as holders of Partnership Units as
described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_.

(b) _ESPP_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement and in any event prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the

equityholders of the Company and the Partnership in connection with the
Mergers (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration to which holders of Company Shares or Partnership Units shall
become entitled pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_. At or prior to the
Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this _Article_
__ _ II_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ").
The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Company Merger Consideration and

expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection
with the exchange of Company Shares and Partnership Units for the applicable
Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Promptly after the Closing, the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
(i) immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares (each, a " _Share Certificate_ ") that were
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ and (ii) immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time represented outstanding
Partnership Units (together with the Share Certificates, the " _Certificates_
") that were converted into the right to receive the Per Partnership Unit

__ _ 2.3(i)_) to the Paying Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(i)_) in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(i)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(i)_)
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration for each Company Share or Partnership Unit, as applicable,

required withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. Promptly after the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall issue and
deliver to each holder of uncertificated Company Shares or Partnership Units
represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Interests_ ") a check or wire
transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(i)_ in
respect of such

 



9

    

 Book-Entry Interests, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such
Book-Entry Interests shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Interests on
the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or
Book-Entry Interests.

 

(c) If payment of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Interest is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that
such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Interest shall be
properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate or Book-Entry Interest surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company or the Partnership,
as applicable, that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(d) Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
2.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Interest (other than any Certificate or
Book-Entry Interest evidencing Company Shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_) shall be deemed at any time after the
Company Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Company Shares or Partnership Units

as applicable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)(i)_.

nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the number of Company Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by the Per
Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ ") and (ii) if
the Closing occurs after 10:30 a.m. (Dallas time) on the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day
after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal
to the DTC Payment.

 

(f) At the Company Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, as applicable, holders of Company Shares or Partnership Units (that are
converted into the right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration or Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable) shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company or limited partners of
the Partnership, other than the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration or Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, as
provided under _Section_ __ _ 2.1_. All cash paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Interests in accordance with the terms
of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares or Partnership
Units, as applicable, formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Interests. On the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Company and
the unit transfer books of the Partnership shall be closed and there shall be
no further registration of transfers of the Company Shares or Partnership
Units (except for the transfer of Partnership Units owned by the Company to
the Surviving Company in the Company Merger and

 



10

    

 the transfer of Partnership Units to Parent Affiliate in the Affiliate
Contribution). If, after the Closing, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent for transfer
or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Interests, such Certificates or Book-
Entry Interests shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article_
__ _ II_.

 

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by the Surviving Company, on a daily basis;  _provided_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. If for any reason (including investment
losses) the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of
the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_), the Surviving Company shall promptly deposit
cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable
to the Surviving Company.

(h) At any time following the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date,
the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which
have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Interests, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Company or the
Surviving Partnership (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws), as applicable, only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificate or Book-Entry Interests.

 

(i) If any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and the holders compliance with the replacement
requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against such Certificates, the Surviving Company or the
Surviving Partnership with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

(j) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Partnership,
Merger Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, the Company or the Paying
Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or Affiliate
thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration from
the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Interests immediately prior to the time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of,
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, and any former holder of
Company Shares or Partnership Units who has not theretofore complied with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for
payment of their claim for applicable Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon.

such amounts as such payor is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to

respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,
each of the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, each as in effect on
the date so filed. As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of such amendment
or superseding filing), none of the Company SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules
and forms. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as

, or  _5.1(b)(xxiii)_ (with respect to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)(xxiii)_, solely

and other authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws.

(iii) " _Materials of Environmental Concern_ " means (A) any hazardous,
acutely hazardous, or toxic (or words of similar import) substance, material

Section 3.14 _Taxes_.

 

(a) All Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed by or on behalf of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have been timely filed in
accordance with all applicable Laws (after giving effect to any extensions of
time in which to make such filings), and all such Tax Returns are true and

Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether or not shown on a Tax Return) have

or for which adequate reserves or accruals have been provided in accordance
with GAAP.

 

(c) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with its taxable year
ended December 31, 2015 (the year with respect to which the Company first
made the election to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) through and including its taxable year ended December 31, 2017, has
been operated in conformity for qualification and taxation as a real
estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 of
the Code, (ii) has operated, and will continue to operate, in such a manner so
as to enable it to qualify for taxation as a REIT from January 1,
2018 through the Company Merger Effective Time and (iii) has not taken or
omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the
Companys failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and no challenge to the

than corporations that have jointly elected with the Company to be a Taxable
REIT Subsidiary, no entity in which the Company owns an interest is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Other than the securities of

defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1,
_et seq._ ).

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
there is no Action by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the

Partnership that seeks to enjoin, or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.6 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub and_ _Merger Partnership_.
Merger Sub and Merger Partnership have been formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, respectively,
neither Merger Sub nor Merger Partnership will have engaged in any other
business activities and will not have incurred any liabilities or obligations
other than as contemplated herein. Immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, Parent will be the sole member of Merger Sub. Immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent will be the sole
general partner of Merger Partnership, and the Surviving Company will be the
sole limited partner of Merger Partnership.

pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_, and to pay all related fees and expenses.

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company a true and complete copy of the executed equity commitment
letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ "), from Sempra and the TTI Members pursuant to which Sempra and the
TTI Members have, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, committed to provide equity financing to Parent in the amounts set
forth therein, which shall, combined, and, together with its available
committed lines of credit, be at least the amount necessary for
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership to satisfy their obligations under
this Agreement, in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Equity Commitment
Letter expressly provides, and will continue to expressly provide until the
earlier of the Closing and the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, that each of the Company and the
Partnership is a third-party beneficiary thereof that is entitled to cause
Parent to obtain the equity financing provided for under the Equity Commitment
Letter subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and in this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and, to the knowledge of Parent, is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Sempra and the TTI Members, enforceable against Sempra
and the TTI Members in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
Exceptions. There is no default under the Equity Commitment Letter by Sempra
and the TTI Members, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder by Sempra or the
TTI Members.

necessary to approve this Agreement or the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the general partner

47

    

  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, if such Acquisition Proposal has not been
withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal, (A) make an Adverse

foreseeable), other than the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition
Proposal, or an inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or the
consequences thereof (an " _Intervening Event_ "), make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, in each case referred to in the foregoing _clauses_ __
_ (i)_ and _(ii)_ , only if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law;
_ _ _provided_ , ___however_ , that the Company Board shall not be entitled
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change under this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_
or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") to Parent at least five Business Days in advance of taking such
actions (the " _Notice Period_ ") to the effect that the Company Board intends
to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances
giving rise to such proposed action, including, in the case such action is

(ii) the Company shall have, and shall have caused its financial and legal
advisors to have, during the Notice Period, negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal (or, in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
an Intervening Event, such that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with the directors duties
under applicable Law); _provided_ , ___however_ , that in the event of any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material terms of such Superior
Proposal or any material change in the facts or circumstances relating to an
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Determination Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)(ii)_ with respect to such new Determination Notice and

48

    

(iii) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board, after
taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in
writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)(ii)_, shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that in
the case of a Superior Proposal, the Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the case of an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event, that the failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the directors
duties under applicable Law), taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Determination
Notice or otherwise.

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _
5.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Company Board or any
committee of the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) making a "stop-look-and listen" communication to the Company stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the Company stockholders) and (iii) making any other
disclosure to the stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_.

 

(i) _No-Shop Period_. From and after the Go-Shop Period End Time, except as
otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers and directors will, and the
Company will cause its, its Affiliates and the Company Subsidiaries
employees and other Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company also agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours
of the Go-Shop Period End Time or, with respect to each Excluded Party, once
such Person ceases to be an Excluded Party) request the prompt return or
destruction of all non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries theretofore furnished by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
their respective Representatives to any such Person with whom a
confidentiality agreement related to a strategic transaction was entered into
at any time in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and
shall cease providing any further information to any such Person or its
Representatives and it will immediately terminate all access granted to any
such Person and its Representatives to any physical or electronic data room.
The Company agrees that it will promptly inform its Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(i)_.

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the submission of the
PUCT Filing (but in any event, no more than 10 days after the date on which
the PUCT Filing is submitted), the Company shall, with the assistance of
Parent, prepare and file the Proxy Statement in preliminary form relating to
the Company Stockholders Meeting and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_,
shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 



49

    

(b) Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Partnership, the Company and the Partnership
shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Partnership will furnish to the Company the information relating to
it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Partnership, the Company and the Partnership shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company
shall, upon written request, provide legal counsel to Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, all responses to
requests for additional information by, and replies to comments of, the SEC,
prior to filing such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and
mailing such documents to the Companys stockholders. The Company
shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or
its legal counsel and agrees that all information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in the form and content
reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, and the
Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon.

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable (but no more than 40 days after the
date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders),
the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (i) take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") and (ii) except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_, include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of the Company vote
in favor of the approval of this Agreement and use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval (including by soliciting
proxies from the Companys stockholders). Unless the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by and determined
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_, the parties shall cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any Person,
which could reasonably be expected to prevent the Company Stockholder
Approval from being obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that any indication by
one or more stockholders of the Company of its or their intent to vote against
the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Company Merger will
not, in and of itself, give rise to any such obligation of the Company. The
Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Company may adjourn, recess, or
postpone, and at the request of Parent it shall adjourn, recess or postpone,
the Company Stockholders Meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional
proxies, if the Company or Parent, respectively, reasonably believes there
will be insufficient Company Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval (
_provided_ _that_ , unless agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, all
such adjournments, recesses or postponements shall be for no more than 10
Business Days each) and (y) the Company may

 



50

    

 adjourn, recess, or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent
(and only to the extent) that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and Parent, that
such adjournment, recess or postponement is necessary under applicable Law for
the filing and distribution of any amended or supplemental disclosure. Upon
written request, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding
the status of the proxy solicitation, including, if requested, by promptly
providing daily voting reports. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with
applicable Law, the rules of the NYSE and the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been
validly terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VII_, the obligation of
the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders shall not
be affected by an Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company, the Company Board
or any committee thereof of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that
no matters shall be brought before the Company Stockholders Meeting other than
the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Company Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any related "golden
parachute" vote under Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and any related and
customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn the meeting to
allow additional solicitation of votes).

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Partnership Merger Effective Time or the
earlier termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice,
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)(viii)_, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Partnership) and/or Hunt Manager to, afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent with applicable
Law, to all their respective properties, facilities, personnel, contracts and
books and records, including to conduct non-invasive environmental site
assessments, and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating and other
data and information as Parent shall reasonably request in writing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall
be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. None of the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or Hunt Manager shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would (i) breach any agreement with any third party, (ii) constitute a waiver
of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company
or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in such a loss, breach or violation of such
privilege).

(b) Except as otherwise expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement,
each party shall continue to abide by the terms of the Amended and Restated
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 18, 2018, by and between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality_ _Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



51

    

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Partnership shall comply with its obligations under all applicable data
protection Laws relating to personally identifiable information provided to
such parties by the Company or the Partnership in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _PII_ "), shall hold all PII
in confidence, and comply with the Company and the Partnerships reasonable
written instructions regarding the handling of PII consistent with applicable
PURA provisions, ERCOT Protocols and practices and other applicable Law.

the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including in connection with obtaining the Regulatory
Approvals, each party shall have exclusive final approval, acting reasonably,
over any testimony that will be made to any Governmental Entity by any of its
Representatives, any written responses to discovery requests directed to that
specific party and any oral presentations of evidence made on behalf of that
specific party. For the avoidance of doubt, this exclusive right of final
approval shall not apply to joint pleadings filed in connection with the PUCT
Filing.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and the Partnership, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger Partnership, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other and
use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as promptly as reasonably practicable, including negotiating, preparing and
filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all

Agreement.

 

(ii) Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Partnership, the Company and the Partnership
shall submit to the PUCT a single, integrated filing (jointly on behalf of

the Mergers, the transactions contemplated by the Asset Exchange Agreement
and the SU Investment (as defined in the Asset Exchange Agreement) (the "
_PUCT Filing_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable

(v) Subject to Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent, Merger
Sub and Merger Partnership, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Partnership, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to provide the other parties a reasonable opportunity to review in advance
and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, all
material information that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, or oral presentations or testimony made to any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining the Regulatory Approvals. In
particular, unless prohibited by Law or a Governmental Entity, no party shall

presentations to a Governmental Entity in connection with the Regulatory
Approvals without first providing the other parties with a copy of such
notification in draft form and giving such other parties a
reasonable opportunity to comment on its content before it is filed with the
relevant Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider all
reasonable comments timely made by the other parties in this respect. In

this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall prevent, limit or restrict any party or its
Affiliates from (A) interacting, communicating or making filings or
applications with, or resolving any investigation or other inquiry of, any
PUCT staff in connection with proceedings before the PUCT, other than
proceedings with respect to the PUCT Filing and (B) responding to unsolicited
inquiries related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any
Governmental Entity ( _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of _clause_ __
_ (B)_, such party will notify the other parties to this Agreement of any
such unsolicited inquiries and such partys response to the inquiries as
promptly as reasonably practicable).

(vii) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership, on the one hand, or the
Company and the Partnership, on the other hand shall be permitted to schedule,
participate in or initiate any meetings or communications with any Other

_however_ , that promptly following any Interested Party Communication,
each party participating in such Interested Party Communication shall provide
a reasonable summary of such communication to each party that did not

has been redacted available to the other party and (B) no party will be
required to provide the other party any personal identifying information that
is submitted to CFIUS pursuant to the DPA.

 

(c) The Company and the Partnership, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Partnership, on the other hand, shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers and equityholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Partnership, the Company, the Partnership or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to or with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Regulatory Approvals.

 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 5.7_, each of the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, the following actions:

 

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the FCC,
the FERC and the PUCT) with jurisdiction over any Regulatory Approvals of
information and documents reasonably requested by any such court or
Governmental Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



54

    

(ii) obtaining the Regulatory Approvals as expeditiously as possible, 
_provided_ that obtaining any such approval does not constitute a Burdensome
Condition; and

(iii) the avoidance of the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary
or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination,
judgment or Law that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or materially impair,
restrain or restrict, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
_provided_ that such avoidance does not constitute a Burdensome Condition.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
"reasonable best efforts" standard set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_
shall not in any event be construed to require Parent, Merger Sub, Merger
Partnership or any of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect
equityholders, or permit or require (except as contemplated by this Agreement
(excluding this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_) or the Asset Exchange Agreement
(excluding Section 5.05 thereof)) the Company, the Partnership or any of their
respective Affiliates without the prior written consent of Parent to (i) sell
or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose or
agree to dispose of any asset, (ii) conduct or agree to conduct its business
in any particular manner (except as contemplated by this Agreement or the
Asset Exchange Agreement), (iii) agree to any order, action or regulatory
condition of any regulatory body, whether in an approval proceeding or another
regulatory proceeding, that would constitute a Burdensome Condition or (iv)
in connection with the CFIUS Approval, offer or agree to mitigation
provisions that limit the right of any member of Parent to retain or exercise
its governance rights, including any amendments, modifications, waivers or
other changes to the governing agreements of Parent.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub, Merger
Partnership, the Company or the Partnership to make any filing in state or
federal court to vacate, modify, reverse, remove, file exceptions to, file a
motion for rehearing of, or appeal any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law entered,
issued or enacted by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unlawful, that would prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or in any manner impair, restrain or restrict,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that in any manner
prohibits, modifies or alters this Agreement (or seeks to do the same), even
if such decision order, judgment, determination, decree or Law imposes or
seeks to impose obligations that do not constitute a Burdensome Condition;
provided that no party shall be required to make any filing whatsoever to
challenge any decision, order, judgment, determination or decree of the PUCT
or the FERC; _provided_ further, however, that if any of Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Partnership, the Company or the Partnership files exceptions to or a
motion for rehearing or appeal of any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction, decision, order, judgment, or determination, decree or
Law entered, issued or enacted by any Governmental Entity, then no other
Party shall oppose or contest such filing.

Section 5.8  _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Partnership, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the Company Board
shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



55

    

Section 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other of (i) any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any Company
Subsidiary which relate to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") or (iii) the discovery of
any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set forth in _Article_ __ _
VI_ not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially
delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.9(a)_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice; _provided_ _further_ , that failure to give prompt
notice pursuant to  _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ shall not constitute a failure of a
condition to the Mergers set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ except to the extent
that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing
alone constitute such a failure.

(b) The Company and Parent shall keep the other parties reasonably informed
with respect to the status of any Transaction Litigation if any such other
party is not a party thereto. The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent
and its Representatives with respect to the defense, negotiations or
settlement of, any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall consider in
good faith Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its
or their Representatives to, compromise, settle or come to a
settlement arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent
thereto unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Company Merger Effective Time) and former officer or
director, including but not limited to the members of the Conflicts Committee,
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Action, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or (ii) acts or omissions taken by an Indemnified Party in their
capacity as such or taken at the request of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company 

 



56

    

 Merger Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Company would have been
permitted under applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as
in effect at the date hereof. In the event of any such Action, (A) each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement from the Surviving Company,
within 10 Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Company from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor, of expenses incurred in the defense
of any Action to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as in effect at the date hereof; _provided_
, that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving Company
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim
(and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C) the Surviving Company shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) The certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable in the
aggregate with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are presently set
forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Company Merger Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect in any
material respect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, the Surviving Company
shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in effect on the date
hereof (accurate and complete copies of which have been previously
made available to Parent) with respect to matters arising on or before the
Company Merger Effective Time or cause to be provided substitute policies or
purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the
Company Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ _further_ , that if the
Surviving Company purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder costs
more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Company shall
purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 300% of such
last annual premium. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on
terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or
before the Company Merger Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_, and such "tail policy" shall satisfy the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_.

 



57

    

 If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for a period of six years from the Closing Date,
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time) is instituted
against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such Action.

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_
shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal Representatives.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.10_.

 

Section 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12 _Dividends_. From and after the date hereof and prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, (a) the Company may make distributions to
its stockholders, the Partnership may make distributions to the Company, and
any direct or indirect Company Subsidiary may make distributions to the
Partnership, to allow for regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per share
to be paid on the Company Shares and Partnership Units (including, in the
event the Closing does not coincide with the end of a quarter, a prorated
portion of the $0.25 per share quarterly cash dividend on the Company Shares
and Partnership Units for the quarter in which the Closing occurs) and (b)
upon consultation with Parent, the Company shall make distributions to its
stockholders (and as necessary the Partnership shall make distributions to the
Company, and any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Partnership may make
distributions to the Partnership, as needed in order to facilitate such
distributions by the Company) so as to (i) maintain the Companys
qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code and (ii) avoid the
payment of income or excise tax under Sections 857 or 4981 of the Code (or any
other entity-level Tax), in each case taking into account the taxable gain
recognized in the deemed sale and subsequent deemed liquidating distribution
occurring at the Company Merger Effective Time (as described in _Section_ __ _
1.9_). If the Company is required to pay a distribution described in _clause_
__ _ (b)_ of the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, or if the
Company declares any other distribution on the Company

 



58

    

 Shares on or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (other than as
described in _clause_ __ _ (a)_ of the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _
5.12_), the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the amount
of the per Company Share amount of any such distribution(s). For the avoidance
of doubt and consistent with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(i)_, any reduction in the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.12_ will give rise to an identical reduction in the Per Partnership
Unit Merger Consideration.

 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to (a) an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (b) a press release or other public statement that is
consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by a party hereto in accordance with
this Agreement, including in investor conference calls, SEC filings, QandAs or
other publicly disclosed documents, in each case under this _clause_ __ _
(b)_, to the extent such disclosure is still accurate in all material respects
(and not misleading), (c) as may be required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system or (d) in
connection with a dispute between the parties hereto regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Partnership, on the one hand, and the Company and the Partnership, on the
other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each
other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement
without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

Section 5.14 _Obligations of_ _Parent and the_ _Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership) to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such
Company Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Company Merger Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Company to cause such Company Subsidiary
to take such action.

Section 5.15 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Sections 5.1(b)(iv)_ , 5.1(b)(v),  _5.1(b)(xiii)_ , _5.1(b)(xiv)_
and _5.12_ , the Company shall take all actions, and refrain from taking all
actions, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company Board, upon advice of
counsel to the Company, and upon consultation with Parent, as necessary to
ensure that the Company (i) will qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S.
federal income tax purposes for its current taxable year and any other taxable
year that includes the Closing Date, (ii) will not become liable for U.S.
federal income Tax under Sections 856(g)(5)(C), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or
Section 337(d) (and/or Section 1374) of the Code (and the applicable Treasury
Regulations thereunder) and similar provisions of state or local Tax law and
(iii) preserves the U.S. federal income Tax status of any Company Subsidiary
as a disregarded entity, partnership, Qualified REIT Subsidiary or Taxable
REIT Subsidiary, as the case may be. After the date of this Agreement and

 



59

    

 prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate in
good faith to address all reasonable requests of Parent with respect to
maintenance of the Companys qualification for taxation as a REIT for the
Companys 2015 through 2017 taxable years (including with respect to the
filing of the 2017 IRS Form 1120-REIT) and the continuation of such
qualification for taxation as a REIT for the taxable year ending with the
Company Merger Effective Time.

(b) Parent and the Company shall, upon written request, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

(c) On and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions, and refrain from
taking all actions, as customary to enable the Company to qualify for taxation
as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its current taxable year
and any other taxable year that includes the Closing Date;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_ shall obligate
Parent or the Surviving Company to take or pursue any Action in a court.

 

(d) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed (taking into account any applicable extensions of time)
all Tax Returns for the Company and each Company Subsidiary required to be
filed (taking into account any applicable extensions of time) prior to the
Closing Date for all taxable periods ending prior to the Closing
Date, including timely filing of Tax Returns for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017 (taking into account any applicable extensions of time) to
the extent such Tax Returns are required to be filed prior to the Closing
Date. Any such Tax Returns prepared by the Company shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the historic Tax accounting practices of the Company
(except as may be required under applicable Tax Law, this Agreement or with
the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall pay all Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns. In the case of Tax Returns that both relate to income
Taxes or the Texas franchise Tax for taxable periods ending prior to the
Closing Date and are to be filed by the Company after the date of this
Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to
Parent copies of such Tax Returns at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to
the due date of such Tax Returns (including applicable extensions). Parent
shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each
Company Subsidiary that are required to be filed on or after the Closing Date.

 

(e) On the Closing Date, prior to the Company Merger, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated as
of the Closing Date, substantially in the form of the sample certification set
forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) and including any
additional information as may be required by Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 1446(f)(2). On the Closing Date, prior to the Partnership
Merger, the Partnership shall deliver to Parent a duly executed
certificate of non-foreign status from each Person that constitutes and is
treated as a partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or, in the case of
any such Person that is a disregarded entity, such Persons sole owner for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) and that has provided such a certificate to
the Partnership. The receipt of such certificates by Parent shall not be a
condition to the Partnership Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, but if Parent has not received such

 



60

    

 certificate from or with respect to a partner (or such partners sole owner,
as applicable), Parent shall be entitled to withhold any applicable U.S. tax
on cash distributed to or on behalf of such Person (as determined by Parent
in its sole discretion), in accordance with Sections 1445 and 1446(f) of the
Code.

 

Section 5.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Company shall cooperate with
Parent and take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by
the Surviving Company of the Company Shares from the NYSE and
the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time, and, in any event, no
more than 10 days after the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.17 _Financing_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and
the Termination Date, each of the Company and the Partnership agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to provide, and to use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership) and each of their
respective Representatives to provide, such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
receipt of proceeds (x) from an issuance of equity by Parent or any of its
direct or indirect equityholders (the " _Equity Financing_ ") or (y) from an
issuance of debt by Parent or any of its direct or indirect equityholders
(the " _Debt Financing_ ," with the Equity Financing and Debt Financing each
referred to hereafter as a " _Financing_ "), including reasonable best efforts
to (i) provide assistance with any discussions of and/or furnish, as
applicable, such business, financial statements, pro forma financials,
projections, management discussion and analysis and other customary financial
data and information reasonably required in connection with any Financing,
all for use in connection therewith, (ii) direct their respective independent
accountants to provide customary and reasonable assistance in connection with
any Financing, including in connection with providing customary comfort
letters and consents, (iii) obtain customary payoff letters, releases of liens
and other instruments of termination or discharge reasonably requested by
Parent or any of its direct or indirect equityholders in connection with the
repayment of indebtedness of the Company, the Partnership and their respective
Subsidiaries as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.19(a)_, authorize and
facilitate discussions, meetings and other engagement by Parent, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, Hunt Manager, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or
SU, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, with the current lenders, noteholders or
other providers of Existing Indebtedness to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries for the purpose of obtaining Debt Financing, including by
necessary or appropriate waivers of the Confidentiality Agreement to
permit such activities. Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided for in this _Section_ __
_ 5.17(a)_ to the extent the information requested was not otherwise prepared
or available in the ordinary course of business. Any lender, underwriter,
arranger, manager, placement agent or similar entity in connection with any
Financing by Sempra or its Affiliates shall be deemed to be a "Representative"
of Sempra for the purposes of the Amended and Restated Confidentiality
Agreement, dated June 18, 2018, by and between Sempra Energy and the Company.
Any lender, underwriter, arranger, manager, placement agent or similar entity
in connection with any Financing by Parent or its Affiliates shall be deemed
to be a "Representative" of Parent for purposes of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



61

    

(b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Termination Date
and the Closing Date, it is understood that Parent or any of its direct or
indirect equityholders may seek to market and consummate all or a portion of
any Financing. In this regard, and for the avoidance of doubt, each of the
Company and the Partnership acknowledges that its cooperation obligations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.17(a)_ include the obligation upon the reasonable
request of Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with any
such efforts; _provided_ , that such cooperation obligations are limited to
those set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.17(a)_.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action that
would subject such Person to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost
or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with any Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ or any information
utilized in connection therewith. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all costs suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of any Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than arising from information provided by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use in the Financing
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.17(a)_). Each of the Company and the Partnership
hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company, the Partnership and
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with any Financing; _provided_ ,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company, the Partnership or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company,
the Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership acknowledge and agree that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
conditioned upon the consummation of, or the receipt by Parent or any of its
direct or indirect equityholders or any of their Affiliates of the proceeds
of, the Financing.

 

(e) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including
any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace the Equity Commitment Letters if
such amendment, modification, waiver or voluntary replacement (i) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the
equity financing as compared to those in the Equity Commitment Letters, each
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in a manner that would make any
portion of the equity financing less likely to be timely obtained, (ii)
adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Equity Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements relating
to the equity financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, in any material respect, relative to the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against such other parties to the Equity Commitment
Letters, each as in effect on the date hereof or in the applicable definitive
agreements relating to the equity financing, (iii) reduces the aggregate
amount of the equity financing (other than reductions of any amounts thereof
constituting increases thereto after the date hereof), or (iv) would otherwise
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt no consent from the Company shall be required for any amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification of the Equity Commitment Letters that
is limited to adding any direct or indirect equityholders of Parent that have
not executed the Equity Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement.

 



62

    

Section 5.18 _APM Private Letter Ruling_.

 

(a) Parent and the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
jointly prepare and file with the IRS written requests (collectively, the "
_Ruling Request_ ," and together with all related materials and supplements
thereto filed or to be filed with the IRS, the " _IRS Submissions_ ") that
the IRS issue a private letter ruling or rulings (the " _APM Private Letter
Ruling_ ") to the effect that a normalization violation will not occur if the
Partnership does not adjust existing accumulated deferred federal income tax
balances to account for the consequences of the basis adjustment under Section
743(b) of the Code resulting from the Mergers.

 

(b) Each party shall provide the other party and its tax counsel with copies
of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, drafts of all
proposed IRS Submissions prepared by the first party and will incorporate any
comments or suggested revisions as are reasonably requested by the other party
or its tax counsel with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the rights to review and comment granted hereunder shall not result in
unreasonable delays in submitting the IRS Submissions to the IRS. To the
extent that a party, in its good faith judgment, considers any information
included in such IRS Submissions (or drafts thereof) to be confidential, such
party may require that any such documents provided to the other party be
redacted to exclude such information. Subject to the foregoing, a party filing
an IRS Submission shall provide the other party with copies of such IRS
Submission promptly following the filing thereof.

the Company shall have the exclusive right to seek, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, the consent of the relevant number of
holders under each of the Subject Notes (the " _Noteholders_ ") to an
amendment to the terms of the Subject Notes substantially on the terms
set forth on _Schedule A-1_ and _Schedule A-2_ hereto, together with any
modified terms (x) as may be acceptable to Parent or (y) that are
reasonably necessary to meet the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.3(h)(i)_ (the " _Noteholder Consents_ "). During the Consent Period, except
upon the prior written request of the Company, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, schedule, participate
in or initiate any meetings or communications with any of the Noteholders or,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, make any public statements with respect to
the subject matter of this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_. Prior to commencing the
solicitation of the Noteholder Consents pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.19(a)_, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the material documents by which the Noteholder Consents will be
solicited or effected and will consider comments from Parent in good faith. As
reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall provide information
regarding the status of the Noteholder Consent process.

(b) In furtherance of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate with the other party and use their reasonable
best efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(h)_.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_, "reasonable best efforts" shall
include the parties hereto taking actions consistent with the Companys
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.17_, subject to the terms set forth on
_Schedule  A-3_ hereto.

(c) Following the good faith determination by the Company that it has
satisfied the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(h)_ (other than to
the extent that any effective Noteholder Consent is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Closing), the Company shall be entitled to notify Parent
in writing of such determination (a " _Consent Determination_ "). Following
Parents receipt of such Consent Determination, the Company shall be deemed to
have satisfied the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(h)_ in full
(subject only to the effectiveness of the amendments to the Subject Notes
prior to or substantially concurrently with the Closing), unless Parent
delivers a written notice to the Company that details the basis of Parents
objections to the Consent Determination (an " _Objection Notice_ ") no later
than the end of the period of 10 Business Days commencing on the date upon
which the Consent Determination was delivered to Parent (the " _Objection
Period_ "). If Parent does not deliver an Objection Notice to the Company
prior to the expiration of the Objection Period, then the Company shall be
deemed to have satisfied the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(h)_
(subject only to the effectiveness of the amendments to the Subject Notes
prior to or substantially concurrently with the Closing) unless and except to
the extent that after the expiration of the Objection Period but prior to the
effectiveness of the Closing an intervening event occurs with respect to SDTS
that will cause the conditions set forth in _clause_ _(i)_ of _Section_ __ _
6.3(h)_ not to be met prior to or substantially concurrently with the
effectiveness of the Closing and the same is not cured or otherwise waived
and/or consented to by the Noteholders prior to or substantially concurrently
with the Closing.

respective properties, facilities, personnel, contracts, books and records

(x)_ and _(y)_ , in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_, not withdrawn prior to such
termination, and in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(iv)_ not publicly withdrawn at least two Business Days prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (B) within 12 months after such termination,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for purposes this _Section_
__ _ 7.3(b)(ii)_, the references to "20% or more" in the definition of

that is later consummated, then promptly (but in no event later than three
Business Days) after the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee; 

 



70

    

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _

Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made by
wire transfer of same-day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Partnership would not enter into this Agreement. The Company acknowledges
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in
reasonable amounts that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which
such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.3_, the Company shall pay to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Partnership its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made plus two percent per annum.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of actual and intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement by the Company, if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances
in which the Company is required to pay the Termination Fee and the
Termination Fee is actually paid to Parent in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 7.3_, the payment of the Termination Fee (and any amounts payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_) shall be Parents, Merger Subs and
Merger Partnerships sole and exclusive remedy against the Company and its
Affiliates, and their respective shareholders and Representatives, relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or thereby

 



71

    

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors (or equivalent governing body) at any time
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, whether before or after the
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be
made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by
the stockholders of the Company without such further approval or adoption.
This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner,
whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of
the parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_ _; Any Determinations, Decisions,
Etc_. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the parties may,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties set
forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c)
subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other parties contained herein; provided, however, that
after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be
made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by
the stockholders of the Company without such further approval or adoption. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. Whenever a determination, decision,
approval, notice or consent of the Company is permitted or required pursuant
to or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including, without
limitation _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and  _Section_ __ _
7.5_, such determination, decision, approval, notice or consent must be
authorized or made by the Conflicts Committee.

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making the initial PUCT Filing, Parent
may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct
or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent company in the Mergers in lieu of
Merger Sub or Merger Partnership, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub or Merger Partnership, as applicable, shall be deemed references to
such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made
herein with respect to Merger Sub or Merger Partnership, as applicable, as of
the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made
with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such designation shall not relieve Parent
from any of its obligations hereunder or otherwise materially impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing

Affiliate of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will

Section 8.9  _Enforcement_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the rights of each party to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and the parties agree that if for any reason any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable damage would occur.
Accordingly, each of the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger Partnership shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located in Dallas County in the State
of Texas, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing to
the contrary, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with specifically enforcing the Equity Commitment Letter, or Parents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter, shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all
conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but which conditions are, at the time the Company or the
Partnership seeks specific performance pursuant to this Section 8.9 capable of
being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time), and (ii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if the
Equity Financing is funded, then it would take such actions required of it by
this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect

Section 8.16 _Liability of Financing Source Parties_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein and except as set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Company and the Partnership agree that neither of them
nor any other Company Subsidiary shall have any rights or claims against any
Person providing the Financing or any of their respective current, former and
future direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees
or Representatives (collectively, the " _Financing Source Parties_ ") in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source Parties shall have any rights or
claims against the Company, the Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise; _provided_ that, following consummation of the Mergers, the
foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties. In addition, in no event
will any Financing Source Parties be liable for consequential, special,

damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in
the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity to specific relief hereunder, including an
