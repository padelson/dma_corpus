\- iii - _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
September 9, 2013, is by and among Molex Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Koch Industries, Inc., a Kansas corporation (" _Parent_
"), and Koch Connectors, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

RECITALS

 

A. The respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved, and declared it advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the
Company as the surviving corporation in the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and have approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

B. The board of directors of the Company has recommended that the Companys
stockholders adopt this Agreement.

 

C. As a condition to and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness
to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, certain stockholders (collectively, the " _Principal Stockholders_
") are entering into voting and support agreements (collectively, the "
_Voting Agreements_ ").

 

D. After this Agreement has been adopted by the Requisite Company Vote and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Merger will occur at the Effective Time, whereby, except
as expressly provided in _Section 4.1_, each issued and outstanding Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

E. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

In consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I __

 

 _THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall continue unaffected by
the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities,

 



\- 1 -  powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

1.2.  _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between Parent
and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 233 Wacker Drive, Suite
5800, Chicago, Illinois, at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on the third business
day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Closing would otherwise occur within the 10 business day period prior to
the date on which the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q would be required to be filed with the SEC, the Closing shall
occur on the third business day after the filing by the Company of such
report (subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions as of the date determined by this proviso). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59
p.m. (Central Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks
are required or authorized to close in the City of Chicago.

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent and
the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Delaware Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL and will
cause to be made all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be mutually agreed between
Parent and the Company in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). If the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware requires any changes in the Delaware Certificate of Merger as a
condition to filing or issuing a certificate that the Merger is effective, the
parties shall execute any necessary revisions incorporating such changes;
_provided_ , such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in
any material change(s) in the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II __

 

 _CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS_

 

 _OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

 

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall become the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until
thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all
actions necessary such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of Company
shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit 2.2_ and,
as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law.

 



\- 2 - ARTICLE III __

 

 _DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

 

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary
(including procuring resignation letters) so that the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

ARTICLE IV __

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_

 

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.05 per
share (the " _Common Stock_ "), each share of Class A common stock, par value
$0.05 per share (the " _Class A Common Stock_ "), and each share of Class B
common stock, par value $0.05 per share (the " _Class B Common Stock_ "), of
the Company (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) Shares owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties; (y) Shares owned by the Company as treasury stock; and (z) Shares
that are owned by stockholders who are entitled to demand, do properly demand,
and have not withdrawn such demand for appraisal rights pursuant to, and
otherwise complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") (clauses (x), (y) and (z),
collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right
to receive an amount equal to $38.50 plus the Dividend Adjustment Amount, in
cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), subject to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.3_, upon surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 4.2_. At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and
any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held in book-entry form (collectively,
" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section 4.3_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Dividend Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount equal to (i) $0.24 multiplied
by (ii) the quotient of (A) the total number of days elapsed between the first
day of the fiscal quarter in which the Closing Date occurs and the Closing
Date; and (B)

 



\- 3 -  the total number of days in such fiscal quarter; _provided_ , that such
amount shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Dividend Adjustment Amount will
not be paid with respect to any fiscal quarter as to which the Company has
already declared or paid its regular quarterly cash dividend in accordance
with _Section 6.1(b)(vii)_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights under
_Section 4.2(f)_ if the holder thereof is a Dissenting Stockholder. 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.05 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the Common Stock, the Class A Common Stock or the Class B Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange, merger, consolidation or readjustment of shares,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, conversion or other similar
change in capitalization, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such
change; _provided_ , that nothing in this  _Section 4.1(d)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Parent shall pay all costs,
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the retention and engagement of
the Paying Agent. In connection with the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall enter into a customary paying agent and nominee agreement with the
Paying Agent, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, setting forth
the procedures to be used in accomplishing the deliveries and other actions
contemplated by this _Section 4.2_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent to be held in trust for
the holders of Shares an amount in cash sufficient for the Paying Agent to
distribute the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article IV. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America or rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect amounts payable under this Article IV, and
Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional cash funds
to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares in the amount of
any such losses to the extent the Exchange Fund does not have sufficient cash
funds to pay the amounts payable under this Article IV. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent, and no part of such earning shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of the Shares.

 



\- 4 - (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than five days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) represented by Certificates: (i) an appropriate and
customary letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be
in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in _Section 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.3_), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement,
except for Certificates representing Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders,
which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair
value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section
262 of the DGCL.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to
deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held
through The Depositary Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depositary
Trust Company whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the

 



\- 5 -  Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
4.3_), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than
five days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The
Depositary Trust Company: (i) an appropriate and customary letter of
transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall
reasonably agree; and (ii) instructions for returning such letter of
transmittal in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon delivery
of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.3_), and
such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of
the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry
Shares representing Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders, which shall be
deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Shares in accordance with and to the extend provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.

 

(c) _Transfers_ _; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration delivered in accordance with the terms of this Article
IV upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, automatically, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Shares (other than the right to receive
the payments and deliveries contemplated by this Article IV). At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the holder of
the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_ _; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including cash and the proceeds of any
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders
of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall, at the option of
the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) that has not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in

 



\- 6 -   _Section 4.3_), without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
_Section 4.2(e)_). If, prior to six years after the Effective Time (or
otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect
hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) has not complied with the
procedures in _Section 4.1(a)_ to receive payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment
in respect of such Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
or group (as such term is used in Section 13 of the Exchange Act) of any kind
or nature.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
reasonable and customary amount and upon such terms as may reasonably be
required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will distribute the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to each
Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. Shares held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall
have withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. In
lieu of receiving the Per Share Merger Consideration, each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect
or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such Persons right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such Person is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such Person to be paid the fair value of the Shares
owned by such Person shall cease and such Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely
for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.3_). The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and the right to control all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any
demand for appraisal under the DGCL. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Proceedings_ " means all actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations,
litigations, investigations, demand letters, notices of violation, mediations,
grievances, audits, examinations, assessments or other proceedings. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any

 



\- 7 -  payment with respect to any demands for appraisal by Dissenting
Stockholders, offer to settle or compromise or settle or compromise any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

4.3. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company
Restricted Shares or Company Options such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Parent in
coordinating the deduction and withholding of any Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld by the Company or any Subsidiary under applicable Tax
Law, including payroll Taxes relating to payments made in respect of Company
Options or Company Restricted Shares. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity; and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

4.4. _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each unvested option granted under the Stock Plans to purchase Shares that is
outstanding and unexercised shall vest in full. The Company shall, within 10
business days after the date of this Agreement, provide each holder of any
such option that was granted under the 2008 Plan (each, a " _2008 Plan
Option_ ") with written notice of such anticipated vesting immediately prior
to the Effective Time and such holders ability to exercise such holders 2008
Plan Option immediately following such vesting, subject to the terms of such
2008 Plan Option and the consummation of the Merger. Each such holder shall be
entitled to, on or prior to October 31, 2013, notify the Company of such
holders intent to exercise such holders 2008 Plan Option following such
vesting, subject to the terms of such 2008 Plan Option and the consummation of
the Merger. To the extent that any such holder notifies the Company of such
holders intent to exercise such holders 2008 Plan Option following vesting
(as described above) and such holders 2008 Plan Option is so exercised in
accordance with the terms thereof, any shares of Class A Common Stock received
upon such exercise shall be considered outstanding Shares for all purposes of
this Agreement, including the right of the holder thereof to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Article IV, less any required
withholding and payroll Taxes. Each option granted under the Stock Plans to
purchase Shares that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time
(each, a " _Company Option_ ") shall be canceled, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive immediately prior to the Effective Time from the
Company, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to
the product of(i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any required
withholding and payroll Taxes (collectively, the "Option Payments"). No holder
of a Company Option that, as of immediately prior to such cancellation, has
an exercise price per Share that is equal to or

 



\- 8 -  greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any
payment with respect to such cancelled Company Option. From and after the
Effective Time, each Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof, and shall only entitle such holder to the Option
Payment, if any. As soon as practicable following the Closing (but no later
than 15 days following the Closing), the Surviving Corporation shall make the
Option Payment, if any, due to each holder of a Company Option by a special
payroll payment through the Companys or Parents payroll.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable Stock Plan, each
share of restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans (each, a " _Company
Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding and unvested shall vest in full so as
to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be considered an outstanding Share for all
purposes of this Agreement, including the right of the holder thereof to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Article IV,
less any required withholding and payroll Taxes.

(c) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all necessary
or appropriate action under (and in accordance with) the Company ESPP to
provide that, on a date prior to the Closing Date (the " _ESPP Termination
Date_ "), (i) all accumulated payroll deductions allocated to
each participants account under the Company ESPP shall thereupon be used to
purchase from the Company shares of Class A Common Stock at the Purchase Price
(as defined in the Company ESPP) using the ESPP Termination Date as the final
Exercise Date (as defined in the Company ESPP) and, thereafter, all
participants rights under the Company ESPP shall terminate; and (ii) the
Company ESPP will terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Class A
Common Stock so purchased that remain outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be considered outstanding Shares for all purposes of this Agreement,
including the right of the holder thereof to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with Article IV, less any required withholding
and payroll Taxes.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the
board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions which are necessary or appropriate (i) to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 4.4_, including obtaining written consent of
optionees holding Company Options granted under the Companys 1998 Stock
Option and Restricted Stock Plan, as amended, for the treatment described in 
_Section 4.4(a)_ as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement; and (ii) to terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Stock Plans, to the extent not already terminated
or expired.

of Common Stock, of which 95,560,076 shares were outstanding and 16,643,540

Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ ")
__. There are no shares of the Company s capital stock available for future

(ii) _Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a true
and complete list of (A) each holder of Company Options; (B) the number of

 



\- 12 -  Company Options held by each such holder as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date; (C) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject
to each such Company Option (i.e., the original amount less exercises and any
forfeitures); (D) the exercise price, expiration date and vesting schedule of
each such Company Option; (E) whether each such Company Option is intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code; and (F) the Stock Plan under which such Company Option was granted.
_Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ also sets forth a true
and complete list of (1) each holder of an award of Company Restricted

Shares subject to each such award of Company Restricted Shares; (4) the
vesting schedule of each such award of Company Restricted Shares, including
any performance-based vesting conditions; and (5) the Stock Plan under which
each such award of Company Restricted Shares was granted. All Company Options
and Company Restricted Shares are evidenced by stock option or restricted
share agreements, in each case, in the forms set forth in _Section
5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, and no stock option agreement or
restricted share agreement contains any terms that are inconsistent with or in
addition to such forms. No outstanding shares of Common Stock, Class A Common
Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock are subject to vesting
restrictions or other risk of forfeiture to the Company under the Stock Plans
or otherwise. Each Company Option and each Company Restricted Share may, by
its terms, be treated as set forth in _Section 4.4_. No Company Options or
Company Restricted Shares have been granted or agreed to be granted after the
Capitalization Date.

 

(iii) Each option to purchase Shares granted under the Stock Plans, whether or
not currently outstanding (each, a " _Granted Option_ "), was duly authorized
no later than the date on which the grant of such Granted Option was by its
terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate
action, including, as applicable, approval by the board of directors of the
Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any
required shareholder approval by the necessary number of votes, and the award
agreement governing such grant was duly executed and delivered by each party
thereto. Each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws and
regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of the NASDAQ Global
Select Market. The per-share exercise price of each Granted Option was equal
to the fair market value of a share of Class A Common Stock on the applicable
Grant Date (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Stock Plan and, to the extent applicable, Sections 409A and 422 of the Code)
and each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the
financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company and
disclosed in the Company Reports in accordance with the Exchange Act and all
other applicable Laws. The Company has not knowingly granted, and

 



\- 13 -  there is not, and has not been, any Company policy or practice to grant
Granted Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Granted Options
with, the release or other public announcement of material information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their financial
results or prospects. Each Granted Option intended to qualify as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies.

of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to or based on the
value of any Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(y) obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
Since the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has not
issued any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests (other than
shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company Options in
existence on the Capitalization Date). Upon any issuance of any Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of
any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations that give the holders thereof the right to vote (or are

Company Reports; and

(F) other Liens levied, assessed or imposed against, or in any

Subsidiaries or otherwise interfere in any material respect with the conduct
of their respective businesses as currently conducted.

year ended June 30, 2013, includes all the Companys Subsidiaries that, as of

the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement,

documents, except, solely with respect to Subsidiaries, as would not result in
material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise interfere
in any material respect with the conduct of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries businesses as presently conducted. Other than the Companys
Subsidiaries, as set forth in _Section 5.1(b)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_, and any acquisitions permitted under _Section 6.1(b)_, the Company
and its Subsidiaries do not directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record,
own any Equity Interests in any other Person, or have any obligations or have

contained in  _Section 5.2_ constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives in connection with the Transactions and the
Company understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations

5.2.  _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and
Merger Sub, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to the Company
as follows:

 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
or otherwise hold, use and operate its properties, rights and other
assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets, properties or the conduct of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, other than where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

As used herein, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event,
change, effect, occurrence, state of facts or development that, individually
or in the aggregate with all other events, changes, effects, occurrences,
states of facts or developments, prevents or delays beyond the Outside Date,
or would be reasonably expected to prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date,

(b) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and

owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.
Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions,
has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no,
and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
capitalization pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other
Transactions.

(c)  _Corporate Authority; Approval_.

(i) No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve
this Agreement and the Merger or the other Transactions. The vote or consent
of Parent or its wholly-owned Subsidiary as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub
(which shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to

 



\- 42 -  approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions subject, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger only, to the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of

Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent
and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(ii) The board of directors of Parent has, at a meeting duly called and held,
and the board of directors of Merger Sub has, by written consent in lieu
thereof, duly adopted resolutions that (A) determined that the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in the best
interests of, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective stockholders, approved

board of directors of Merger Sub has directed that this Agreement be submitted
to the sole stockholder of Merger Sub for its adoption; and (C) authorized
and approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Merger and the other Transactions by Parent and Merger Sub. Parent, in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement
promptly following the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the actions described in
the immediately preceding sentence has been amended, rescinded or modified in
any respect.

connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain,

and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other Transactions will not (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both), constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a
default under, or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Parent or Merger Sub; (B) with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, a
breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination), modification,

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary, in
response to an unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that was

to which the Company has complied with its obligations under this _Section
6.2_ (a " _Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal_ ") made on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
the Company, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person that has
made such Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the
Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality and
standstill agreement on terms that are no less restrictive than those

sentence of _Section 6.2(h)_) and promptly discloses to Parent (and, if
applicable, contemporaneously provides copies of) any non-public 

 



\- 51 -  information so provided to such Person to the extent not previously provided
to Parent; and (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any Person (and its Representatives) that has made such Bona Fide
Acquisition Proposal with respect to such Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that, prior to taking any action described in clause
(ii)(A) or (ii)(B) above, (1) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a
written notice at least one business day prior to taking any such action
described in clause (ii)(A) or (ii)(B) above (x) stating that the board of
directors of the Company intends to take such actions described in clause
(ii)(A) or (ii)(B) above; (y) stating that the board of directors of the

Proposal (including any materials relating to such Persons proposed equity
and debt financing, if any); (2) the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
and legal advisors, that such Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal; and (3) the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer made by a Person (other
than Parent or Merger Sub) relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition
or purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of
(A) 15% or more of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (B) 15% or more of any class of
outstanding Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class
of outstanding Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries; (iii) any merger, consolidation, exclusive license, business
combination, joint venture, partnership, share exchange or other transaction
involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to
which any Person or its holders of Equity Interests would beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, 15% or more of any class of outstanding Equity
Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the surviving entity
or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or the surviving entity resulting, directly or indirectly, from
any such transaction; or (iv) concerning any recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or any other similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Transactions.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal that the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Bona Fide Acquisition
Proposal, including the financing terms thereof, the nature of the
consideration offered, the provisions permitting the payment of dividends by
the Company, the expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation
(including as a consequence of the impacts of any Antitrust Law on such Bona
Fide Acquisition Proposal), is reasonably likely to be

 



\- 52 -  consummated in accordance with its terms, and, if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the holders of each of the Common Stock,
the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock from a financial point
of view than the Transactions (including any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions proposed by Parent, whether pursuant to _Section 6.2(e)_ or
otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "15% or more" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "more than 85%."

 

(c) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as set forth in _Sections 6.2(d)_ ,
_6.2(e)_ and _6.2(f)_ , the board of directors of the Company and each
committee of the board of directors shall not:

(i) withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or announce any
intention to withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation;

 

(ii) fail to announce publicly, within 10 business days after a tender offer
or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company shall have been
commenced, that the board of directors of the Company recommends rejection of
such tender or exchange offer;

 

(iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
distributed to the Companys stockholders in connection with the
Stockholders Meeting;

(iv) make any other public statement of the board of directors of the Company
or a committee thereof that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation;
or

(v) approve, adopt, recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses
6.2(c)(i) through 6.2(c)(v) being referred to as a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that the making of any determination of the
board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof to provide, or the
provision of, a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event Notice in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a Change of Recommendation.

(d) _Certain Permitted Changes of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote, the board of directors of the
Company may effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may be, a
Change of Recommendation if (i) the board of directors of the Company
determines that (A) after complying with _Section 6.2(e)(i)_, a Bona Fide
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (B) after complying
with  _Section 6.2(e)(ii)_, an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing; and (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
this Agreement and the Merger is no longer in the best interests of the
Companys

 



\- 53 -  stockholders and that such Change of Recommendation is required in order to
satisfy its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means any
material event, development or change in circumstances that first occurs,
arises or becomes known to the Company or its directors after the date of this
Agreement, to the extent that such event, development or change in
circumstances was not reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the following
events, developments or changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening
Event: (1) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (2) any event, development or
change in circumstances relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates; (3) any change in Laws applicable to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; (4) any increase in the price, or change in
trading volume, of Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the London
Stock Exchange ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the exception to this clause
(4) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to
such increase or change or prevent any of such underlying causes from being
taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred
except to the extent such underlying causes are otherwise excluded pursuant to
any of the foregoing clauses (1) through (3)); and (5) meeting or exceeding
internal or analysts expectations, projections or results of operations (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the exception to this clause (5) shall not apply
to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such circumstances
or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred except to the extent
such underlying causes are otherwise excluded pursuant to any of the foregoing
clauses (1) through (4)).

 

(e) _Procedure Prior to Change of Recommendation_.

 

(i) _Superior Proposal_. The board of directors of the Company or any
committee of the board of directors shall be entitled to make any Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent such
Change of Recommendation is permitted under _Section 6.2(d)_), only if (A)
the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") (1) stating that the board of directors of the Company
intends to take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.2(d)_; (2) stating that
the board of directors of the Company has made the determinations set forth
in _Sections 6.2(d)(i)_ and _6.2(d)(ii)_ ; and (3) including an unredacted
copy of such Superior Proposal and proposed and unredacted form of any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement related to such Superior Proposal
(including any materials relating to such Persons proposed equity and debt
financing, if any); and (B) the Negotiation Period, as may be extended, has
expired. During the four business day period commencing on the date
of Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (the " _Negotiation
Period_ "), the Company shall engage, and shall cause its Representatives to
be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith negotiations
with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding an
amendment of this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Each
time the financial or other material terms or conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (or terms or conditions related thereto, such as the proposed equity
and debt financing) are amended or modified, the Company shall be required to
deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice (including, as attachments
thereto, amended forms of the written Alternative Acquisition Agreements
relating to such Acquisition Proposal) and the Negotiation Period shall be
extended by an additional two business days from the date of Parents receipt
of such new Superior Proposal Notice.

 



\- 54 - (ii) _Intervening Event_. The board of directors of the Company or any
committee of the board of directors shall be entitled to make any Change of
Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event (to the extent such
Change of Recommendation is permitted under _Section 6.2(d)_), only if (A)
the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ ") (1) stating that the board of directors of the
Company intends to take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.2(d)_; (2)
stating that the board of directors of the Company has made the
determinations set forth in _Sections 6.2(d)(i)_ and _6.2(d)(ii)_ ; and (3)
including a summary, in all material respects, of the Intervening Event; and
(B) the Intervening Event Negotiation Period, as may be extended, has
expired. During the five business day period commencing on the date of
Parents receipt of such Intervening Event Notice (the " _Intervening Event
Negotiation Period_ "), the Company shall engage, and shall cause its
Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
an amendment of this Agreement such that the board of directors of the
Company, or such committee of the board of directors, would no longer be
required or permitted to take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.2(d)_. Each
time there is a material change to the facts or circumstances relating to the
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver to Parent a new
Intervening Event Notice (including, as attachments thereto, a summary of the
changes to the facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event) and
the Intervening Event Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional
three business days from the date of Parents receipt of such new Intervening
Event Notice.

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its required
disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal or an Intervening Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
Company, the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall
make any Change of Recommendation, except in accordance with _Section
6.2(d)_; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
"Stop-Look-and-Listen" communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation or to violate this
_Section 6.2_. Disclosure of the type described in this _Section 6.2(f)_
(other than the type described in the second proviso of the foregoing
sentence) that is not an express rejection of any Acquisition Proposal or an
express confirmation that the Company Recommendation remains in effect shall
be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.

 

(g) _Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and other
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with, or any solicitation or intentional
assistance or encouragement of, any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal) which are on-going as of the date of this Agreement and request that
any such Person promptly return and destroy (and confirm destruction of) all
confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company shall take the necessary steps to promptly inform, on the date of this
Agreement, the individuals or entities referred to in the preceding sentence
of the obligations in this _Section 6.2_.

 

(h) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this _Section 6.2_, the Company
shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and
in writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than requests for information in
the 

 



\- 55 -  ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to
an Acquisition Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of such discussions, proposals,
offers or requests, and including in the written version of such notice, an
unredacted copy of any written (including via electronic transmission)
proposals, offers or requests, in each case, including any amendments or
modifications thereto. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within
24 hours after any amendment or modification of, or development with respect
to, any such proposal, offer, request or Acquisition Proposal, or at the
reasonable request of Parent) notify Parent orally and in writing of the
status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests, including any
material developments, notifications, amendments or modifications thereto and
furnish to Parent copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation and written summaries of any material oral inquiries in
connection with such discussions, proposals, offers or requests. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives not to, enter into any Contract that would prohibit them from
providing the information required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(h)_.

 

(i) _Company Subsidiaries and Representatives_. Any failure of the Companys
Subsidiaries or the Companys or its Subsidiaries Representatives to fully
comply with this _Section 6.2_ (as if such Subsidiaries and Representatives
were directly subject to this _Section 6.2_), or any failure of any Principal
Stockholder to fully comply with Section 3(b) of the applicable Voting
Agreement, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the
Company.

 

(j) _Stockholder Vote Option_. If the board of directors of the Company
effects, or causes the Company to effect, as the case may be, a Change of
Recommendation, Parent shall have the option (the " _Stockholder Vote Option_
"), exercisable within five business days after such Change of Recommendation,
to cause the board of directors of the Company to submit this Agreement to
the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives not to submit to a vote of the stockholders of the Company
any Acquisition Proposal other than the Transactions, including the Merger.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of the exercise of the Stockholder
Vote Option the Company may not, prior to termination of this Agreement, enter
into a definitive agreement giving effect to any Acquisition Proposal.

6.3. _Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance
with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all
action reasonably necessary (i) to establish a record date for, duly call and
give notice of a meeting of holders of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the "Stockholders Meeting" and the
record date for the Stockholders Meeting, the "Record Date") to consider and
vote upon (a) the adoption of this Agreement; and (b) a non-binding advisory
vote on "golden parachute" executive compensation arrangements if required by
Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act; and (ii) mail the Proxy Statement to
the stockholders of record of the Company and to other stockholders as
required by Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act, as of the Record Date, in each
case, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any
event within five business days following the date on which the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement) (the date the

 



\- 56 -  Company is required to take such actions, the "Proxy Date"). The Company
shall convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable
after the Proxy Date; provided, however, that (1) in no event shall the
Stockholders Meeting be held later than 35 calendar days following the date
the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders; and (2) the
Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, other than to the extent required to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the SEC or its staff has instructed the Company is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section _6.2(d)_ and Section _6.2(e)_
hereof, the board of directors of the Company shall recommend such adoption of
this Agreement and include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Stockholders Meeting has been
convened, the Company shall, upon the request of Parent, and the Company may,
if Parent does not make such request, adjourn the Stockholders Meeting on one
or more occasions to the extent necessary (x) to solicit additional proxies
in favor of adoption of this Agreement, for such time period as determined by
Parent (or, if Parent does not make such request, as determined by the
Company); or (y) allow two business days to pass after the expiration of the
most recent Negotiation Period before the meeting is reconvened; provided,
however that in the case of clause (x) (I) such adjournment shall not exceed
15 calendar days for each such adjournment; (II) the Stockholders Meeting
shall not be adjourned by more than 45 calendar days in the aggregate from the
originally scheduled date of the Stockholders Meeting; and (III) no such
adjournment shall be permitted if the Company shall have received by the
Stockholders Meeting an aggregate number of proxies voting for the adoption
of this Agreement, which have not been withdrawn, such that the condition in
Section _7.1(a)_ would be satisfied if a vote were taken at
the Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established the Record Date,
the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a different record
date without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by
Law (determined after consultation with outside counsel), including as a
result of any adjournment or postponement of the Stockholders Meeting
pursuant to the prior sentence. If the Record Date is changed, the Company
shall, as to that Record Date, comply with each of its obligations under this
Section _6.3_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of, or if there has been a Change of Recommendation pursuant
to Section 6.2, with respect to, the adoption of this Agreement and shall
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Stockholders Meeting
are solicited in compliance with all applicable Law. Unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall submit
this Agreement to its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting even if the
board of directors of the Company shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation or proposed or announced any intention to do so. The Company
shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a
daily basis on each of the last seven business days prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the adoption of this Agreement.

6.4. _Transaction Filings_. As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement and in any event within 10 business days of the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the
SEC. The Company shall include the Company Recommendation and the Company
Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in accordance with Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, in the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall cause the Transaction Filings filed or furnished by the Company
or

 



\- 57 -  its Subsidiaries to comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and to satisfy all rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and
the London Stock Exchange. The Company will cause the Transaction Filings, at
the time each is filed with the SEC or the FCA, as applicable, and at the time
of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements
thereto, to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no agreement,
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Transaction Filings. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Transaction
Filings. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Merger Sub will furnish the Company the information relating to it required
by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be
set forth in the Transaction Filings. The Company shall not file any
Transaction Filing, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
(which comments shall be reasonably considered in good faith by the Company).
The Company shall, in accordance with the Listing Rules of the FCA, file the
Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto and any other
required document or notice) with the FCA, and announce the same by regulatory
announcement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve,
and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in
resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the
SEC. The Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC
comments with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law and the
Company shall promptly prepare, file with the SEC and, if any such correction
is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mail to its stockholders
an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction, as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within 24 hours) (i) notify Parent of the
receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and; (ii) provide Parent with copies
of all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on

Consents, including determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise
respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or Proceedings
challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions;

obtain any Antitrust Consent or Other Governmental Consent; or (B) pay any
fee, penalty or other consideration to any Governmental Entity or other Person
in order to obtain any Antitrust Consent or Other Governmental

Parent and Merger Sub shall have the absolute right to contest, at their cost
and expense ( _provided_ , that such costs and expenses shall be included for
purposes of calculating the amount of the Expense Reimbursement (if any) paid
pursuant to _Section 8.5(d)_), any challenge to this Agreement by any
Governmental Entity, including contesting through a litigation proceeding
initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to
enjoin the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and to control all
aspects of said litigation for the parties, _provided_ , that (y) such actions
do not prevent the Closing from occurring by no later than the Outside Date;
and (z) Parent and Merger Sub afford the Company and its Representatives,
with reasonable advance written notice of any such contest or litigation, an
opportunity to participate in the development and formulation of the legal
strategy of such contest or litigation, an opportunity to participate in all
associated Proceedings, and Parent and Merger Sub shall consider in good faith
the Companys views and opinions in all material respects related to such
matters ( _provided_ , that, notwithstanding clause (z) above, Parent and
Merger Sub shall retain full discretion and authority with respect to the
aspects of any such litigation described in clause (z) above).

 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, Parent and the Company each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with any
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity or
other Person in connection with the parties respective obligations under
_Section 6.5(a)_.

responsible for all statutory filing fees incurred by Parent and the Company

the Company. Other than (i) Parents obligation to pay filing fees as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence; (ii) Parents obligation to pay
counsel responsible for obtaining the Antitrust Consents on behalf of Parent
and the Company in Japan, Mexico and South Korea; or (iii) as Parent and the
Company may otherwise agree in writing, each of Parent and the Company shall
be responsible for its own costs and expenses, including those of any
necessary experts or consultants, incurred by Parent or the Company,
as applicable, in connection with any review of, inquiry into, investigation
of, or challenge to the Transactions.

(d) _Notification Requirements_. Each party shall promptly notify the other
party of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement. The parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. The parties will
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. The parties shall take
reasonable best efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any
applicable privilege.

 

6.6. _Access and Reports; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable Law and
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (a) afford Parents
officers and Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to its officers, employees, agents, properties, assets,
books, offices, facilities, Contracts, Tax Returns, and records and other
information as shall be reasonably requested by Parent; (b) use reasonable
best efforts to furnish promptly during normal business hours such
information concerning the business, properties, offices, facilities,
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent or its Representatives shall reasonably request; (c) reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives to organize and facilitate
meetings among Parent and its Representatives and the Company and its
Representatives to be located at the offices and facilities of the Company and
its Subsidiaries at such times as Parent may reasonably request; (d) use
reasonable best efforts to furnish or produce information related to the
financial or tax records of the Company if reasonably requested by Parent

Companys regular external advisors to produce such information); and (e)
reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Representatives with respect
to communications to, and to organize and facilitate meetings with,
customers, suppliers and other key business relations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request (any such communications and
meetings shall be made jointly by Parent and the Company and in consultation
with the Company); _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify or limit any representation
or warranty made by the Company herein or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties hereto under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) would (A) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or

 



\- 60 -  violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure; or (B) result in a violation of
any Antitrust Laws; (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such disclosure would result in the
loss of such privilege (in each case, it being agreed that the Company shall
give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such access or
information and thereafter the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such access or information, as applicable, to be provided, or made
available, in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a
disclosure, violation or waiver); or (iii) take any action that unreasonably
interferes with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or the discharge by employees of their employment responsibilities. All
requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be
directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein.

6.7. _Termination of Trading and Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
actions and other items described on _Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ and all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market, the FCA or the London Stock Exchange to enable the delisting by
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ Global Select Market
and official list maintained by the FCA in respect of the London Stock
Exchange and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than 10 days after the Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to no longer be quoted on the

respect of the London Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

6.8. _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other prior
to issuing, and shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except (a) as required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any applicable national securities exchange
or interdealer quotation service (in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the
other reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final
discretion of the disclosing party); (b) with respect to any press release or
other public statement by the Company expressly permitted by _Section 6.2_;
or (c) with respect to any press releases or other public statements by Parent
in response to any public announcement permitted by clause (b) hereof.

shall issue a joint press release in a form mutually agreed to by the Company
and Parent announcing the execution of this Agreement and the transactions

as exhibits; and (B) file such press release and a copy of this Agreement
with the FCA identifying, in accordance with the Listing Rules of the FCA, the
intentions expressed in the press release to have the listing of the Shares
cancelled by the FCA as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in
both cases, after considering any comments from Parent in good faith.

6.9. _Employee Benefits and Related Matters_.

(a) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
entitled to participate in after the Effective Time (each such plan, a " _New
Plan_ ") to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit
accrual and eligibility to receive benefits thereunder, compensation and
service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such
compensation and service were with Parent to the same extent such compensation
and service were credited under a comparable plan of the Company, except (i)
to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits; or (ii) with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements, waiting periods and any other eligibility requirements
of such New Plan for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent they were inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, the Benefit Plans;
and (B) cause any expenses incurred by any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and his or her covered dependents pursuant to any Benefit Plan
during the portion of the plan year of such Benefit Plan ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins, to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
under the New Plan as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
New Plan, to the extent such amounts had been taken into account under the
applicable Benefit Plan.

(b) Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.9_ shall (i) be treated as an
amendment to any particular Benefit Plan or New Plan; or (ii) obligate Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to maintain any
particular plan or retain the employment of any particular employee or limit
the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any particular Benefit Plan or New Plan. This
_Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_, express
or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other right in any
other Person, including any current or former director, officer, employee or
other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any other
individual associated therewith or any union, works council or collective
bargaining representative thereof) or any participant in a Benefit Plan, New
Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof).

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in all
cases prior to the Closing Date), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
complete the works council and trade union notifications and consultations
they are required by applicable Laws to have completed prior to the Closing
Date in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions and their respective

 



\- 62 -  effects and shall have complied with all other notification, consultation
and similar obligations (whether statutory or contractual) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries required to be complied with by them prior to the
Closing Date in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions and their
respective effects. Prior to distribution of any correspondence or other
documentation with respect to this Agreement, the Transactions or any of
their respective effects to any of their employees or any works council, trade
union or similar employee representative body, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered in
good faith by the Company and its Subsidiaries).

(d) The Company shall (i) take all necessary or appropriate action under (and
in accordance with) the Deferred Compensation Plans to provide that, on and
after a date prior to the Closing Date, all payments under the Deferred
Compensation Plans shall be made in cash with each stock unit held by a
participant thereunder being converted, on the earlier of the applicable
payment date following an event triggering distribution under the applicable
plan or the Effective Time, into the right to a cash amount which, as of the
Effective Time, shall be equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject
to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plans; and (ii) take all necessary
or appropriate actions under (and in accordance with) the Deferred
Compensation Plans and the 2005 Molex Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan,
as amended (the " _SERP_ "), to terminate the Deferred Compensation Plans and
the SERP in accordance with Section 409A of the Code on a date within the 30
day period prior to the Closing Date and to provide that all payments and
obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plans and the SERP shall be
settled prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code.

 

6.10. _Expenses_. Parent or its designee shall pay all charges and expenses of
the Paying Agent in connection with the provisions set forth in Article IV.
Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.5(c)_, _Section 8.5(a)_ or
_Section 8.5(d)_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) For a period of ten years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present
(as of the Effective Time) and former director and officer of the Company
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), to the extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement, against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities incurred by such individual in connection with any Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to any act or omission of the Indemnified Parties occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as officer or director of the
Company whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to also advance all expenses
incurred to each Indemnified Party with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.11(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on

 



\- 63 -  the date of this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
shall, prior to such advances, provide an undertaking to repay such advanced
expenses, if it is ultimately determined that such individual is not entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.11(a)_.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to retain and maintain in
effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the current directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company covering the persons serving as officers and directors of the Company
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered
Persons_ "), at no expense to the beneficiaries, with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions) and with coverage
terms, benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured retentions
and deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not
less advantageous to the Covered Persons as those in effect on the date of
this Agreement (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"); _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) Parent may substitute for the insurance coverage called for by this
_Section 6.11(b)_, a policy or policies from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier
covering the Covered Persons for a period of at least six years from and after
the Effective Time, at no expense to the beneficiaries, with respect to acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions) and having
coverage terms, benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured
retentions and deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the
aggregate not less advantageous to the Covered Persons as those in effect
under the DandO Insurance on the date of this Agreement; (ii) in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for the insurance
coverage called for by this _Section 6.11(b)_ an annual premium amount in
excess of 400% of the amount expended (or to be expended) by the Company
to maintain the DandO Insurance for the annual term in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, which premium the Company represents and warrants to be
approximately $700,000 (the " _Insurance Amount_ "); and (iii) if the annual
premium for the insurance called for by this _Section 6.11(b)_ exceeds the
Insurance Amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations under this _Section 6.11(b)_
shall be satisfied if prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain as of the Effective Time a "tail" policy under
the DandO Insurance covering the Covered Persons for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time, at no expense to the beneficiaries,
with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
Transactions) and having coverage terms, benefits, levels of coverage
(including limits, self-insured retentions and deductibles) and other terms
and conditions which are in the aggregate not less advantageous to the
Covered Persons as those in effect under the DandO Insurance on the date of this
Agreement.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Charter and Bylaws to contain
as of the Effective Time provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
(until the Effective Time) directors, officers and employees than are
presently set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
as to any act or omission occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified (by merger or
otherwise) for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 



\- 64 - (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.11_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each of
the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.11_ shall be
in addition to, and shall not in any way limit, any rights such Indemnified
Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 

6.12. _Takeover Laws_. If Section 203 of the DGCL or any other state takeover
law or state Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or
the ability to acquire or vote Shares, including any "business combination,"
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other similar anti-
takeover Law (each, a " _Takeover Law_ ") is or may become applicable to the
Merger or the other Transactions, the Company and its board of directors
and/or Parent and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors, as
applicable, shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and the parties shall otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
Transactions.

6.13. _Stockholder Proceedings_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall control, and the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense of any Proceedings brought by the
Companys stockholders or other Persons against the Company or any of its
directors or officers or Representatives arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions and shall keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any such Proceedings. Each of Parent and the
Company shall give the other reasonable opportunity to consult with it
regarding the defense or settlement of any such Proceedings brought by its
stockholders and shall give due consideration to the other partys advice with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting
from the Transactions, or consent to the same, without the prior
written consent of Parent.

6.14. _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date (to be
effective as of the Effective Time) the resignation of each director of the
Company (in their capacities as directors and not as employees) as Parent
shall request in writing not less than five days prior to the Closing Date.

 



\- 65 - 6.15. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
reasonably necessary, the Company shall take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions
of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.16. _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Until the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

6.17. _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a statement, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent that satisfies the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h)(2).

 

6.18. _Certain Notices_. Until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall
promptly notify in writing the other parties of (i) any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to the Transactions; (ii) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the obligations of such party to effect the Transactions,
including the Merger, not to be satisfied; or (iii) the failure of such party
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any other party to
effect the Transactions, including the Merger, not to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section _6.18_
shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

_Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 8.2(a)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure

of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or any of such representations and warranties shall
have become inaccurate as of any date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy (i) has resulted
in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ (assuming, in the case of any inaccuracy, that such subsequent date
was the Closing Date) which remains in effect as of the time of such
termination; and (ii) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by Parent within 45
days after reasonably detailed written notice thereof is given by the Company
to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the right

is then in material breach of any of its material covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement; or

(b) at any time prior to (but not after) the time the Requisite Company Vote
is obtained, if (i) the board of directors of the Company makes a Change of
Recommendation in compliance with _Section 6.2(d)_ and (ii) Parent determines

if:

 

(a) whether before or after the time the Requisite Company Vote has been
obtained, the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any of such representations and warranties shall have become
inaccurate as of any date subsequent to the date of this Agreement, which
breach, or failure to perform or inaccuracy (i) has resulted in the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ (assuming in the
case of any inaccuracy, that such subsequent date was the Closing Date) which
remains in effect as of the time of such termination; and (ii) is not capable
of being cured prior to the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured by the Company within 45 days after reasonably detailed
written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.4(a)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material
breach of any of its respective material covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement; or

(b) at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, (i) the
board of directors of the Company makes a Change of Recommendation (whether
or not in compliance with _Section 6.2(d)_); or (ii) the Company shall have
breached in any material respect its obligations under _Section 6.2_.

 

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 8.5_ and _Sections 9.1_ and _9.9_ ,
in the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VIII by any party or parties to this
Agreement, written notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to this
Agreement specifying the provisions of this Article VIII pursuant to
which such termination is made and the basis therefore described in
reasonable detail, and upon such termination, this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party
hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ ,
_however_ , and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, that (i) no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to
the other parties hereto resulting from any fraud or intentional material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth
in this Agreement; and (ii) the provisions set forth in this _Section 8.5_
and Article IX shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



\- 71 - (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section 8.4(b)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$232,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") promptly (but in no event later than
two business days) after such termination. In the event that this Agreement
is to be terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, then the
Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee immediately prior to such
termination.

 

(c) In the event that (i) a Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the stockholders of
the Company or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether
or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.2(b)_, by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ due to the Companys failure
to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or by Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ at a time when this Agreement
was terminable by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ due to the Companys
failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement; and
(iii) within nine months after any such termination (A) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to, or shall have approved or recommended to the Companys
stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal; or (B) there
shall have been consummated an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall
pay the Termination Fee to Parent upon the earlier of (1) the consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal, or (2) entry into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds; _provided_ , that
the Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 8.5(c)_ shall be
reduced by the Expense Reimbursement, if any, actually paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.5(d)_. For purposes of this _Section 8.5(c)_,
the references to "15% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ after a Bona Fide Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
stockholders of the Company or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal;
or (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ due to the Companys failure
to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, then the
Company shall pay to Parent its and its Affiliates reasonable costs,
fees, and expenses incurred in connection with their investigation,
consideration, documentation, diligence and negotiation of this Agreement and
the Transactions, including all fees and expenses of Parents and its
Affiliates Representatives and Financing Sources (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ , that the Expense Reimbursement shall not
exceed $15,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the Expense Reimbursement
shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against
the Company.

(e) All payments under this _Section 8.5_ shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

(f) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the Merger and the other
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company would enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to promptly pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this _Section
8.5_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Proceeding that
results in an Order against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent
the costs and expenses

 



\- 72 -  (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding
and shall pay interest on the amount payable pursuant to such Order,
compounded quarterly, at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from
the date such amounts were required to be paid (but for such Proceeding) until
the date of actual payment.

 

(g) Subject to _Section 8.5(a)_ and _8.5(f)_ , in the event that the
Termination Fee is paid by the Company to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 8.5_, the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against the Company for any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation in this Agreement by the Company, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective former, current or
future Representatives, agents, partners, managers, members, stockholders,
assignees or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligations
relating to or arising out of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not impair the rights of Parent, if any, to obtain
injunctive relief pursuant to _Section 9.6_ prior to any termination of this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IX __

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL_

 

9.1. _Survival_. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement
or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time. This Section _9.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement
of the parties, which by its terms contemplates performance after the
Effective Time. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub contained in Section _6.10_ (Expenses) and Section _8.5_
(Effect of Termination and Abandonment) and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

9.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify or
amend this Agreement (by action approved by or on behalf of their respective
boards of directors) by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, after adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, no
amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders
without any such required approval.

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other; (b) waive
any inaccuracy or breach in the representations and warranties of the other
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive
compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this
Agreement which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders without any such
required approval.

 



\- 73 -  Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission, each
such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement. Until and
unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF, THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit for themselves and their property,
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, or if such Court shall not have jurisdiction, the Federal courts
of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any appeal thereof, solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Merger and the
other Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document or Transaction, that it is not subject thereto or that such
Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such Proceeding or transactions
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or such Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the Person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
Proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.7_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or support any action, suit or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Sources, if any, in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any
financing to be undertaken by Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates for the
purpose of funding the Transactions and the related fees or expenses (the "
_Financing_ "), or the performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of
New York, whether a state or federal court, and the provisions of _Section
9.5(b)_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action,
suit or proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Financing shall not be a
condition to the consummation of the Transactions. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Financing Source_ " means any future source of debt
financing, if any, that may provide financing to Parent or Merger Sub for the
Transactions. 

 



\- 74 - (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDINGS
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF PROCEEDINGS, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 

9.6. _Remedies_. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage
would occur to each of the parties to this Agreement in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of a party hereunder to consummate the Merger) were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and
that in the event of such breach no adequate remedy at law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine. Accordingly, in addition to any other
remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, each party shall
be entitled, without proof of damages, to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the terms and provisions hereof
requiring a party hereunder to consummate the Merger) in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware, and to temporary, preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief (without the requirement of posting bond) to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
any of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting bond
or other security or undertaking (any requirements therefor being expressly
waived). Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance relief on the basis that a party has an adequate remedy at law or
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity.

 

9.7. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by
facsimile or overnight courier:

hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter and the confidentiality agreement dated
July 25, 2013, between Koch Equity Investments, LLC and the Company (as
amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement") (which was effective July 15, 2013,
and superseded the confidentiality agreement dated July 15, 2013, between the
same parties) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other
prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written
and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



\- 76 - 9.9. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 6.11_ (Indemnification; Directors and
Officers Insurance) which shall inure to the benefit of the persons
benefiting therefrom, who are expressly intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof, this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 9.3_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Financing Sources, if any, are hereby third-party beneficiaries of _Section
9.5_ and this _Section 9.9_.

(b) Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement may only be brought against persons that are expressly named as
parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
members, managers, agents, trustees, Affiliates, general or limited partners,
Financing Sources or assignees of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or of any
former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling
person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent,
trustee, Affiliate, general or limited partner, Financing Source or assignee
of any of the foregoing (collectively, but for the avoidance of doubt
excluding the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the " _Excluded Parties_ ")
shall have any liability or obligation for any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, under this Agreement or of or for any
Proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions
(including the breach, termination or failure to consummate such
Transactions), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law or
otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate or
partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another Person or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this _Section
9.9(b)_ shall limit the obligation of any Excluded Party contained in the
Voting Agreements.

9.10. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such

 



\- 77 -  Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Each
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement shall be deemed a representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by Parent and Merger Sub jointly and all liability and
obligations relating thereto shall be deemed joint liabilities and
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub.

9.11. _Definitions_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, each of the
terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in the Section of this Agreement set
forth opposite such term.

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to an Article, Section, Annex of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation" or words of like import. The
use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, or the singular or plural
form of words used herein (including defined terms) shall not limit any
provision of this Agreement. Reference herein to a particular Person includes
such Persons successors and assigns to the extent such successors and
assigns are permitted by the terms of any applicable Contract. Reference to a
particular Contract (including this Agreement), document or instrument means
such Contract, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Any reference to a
particular Law means such Law as amended, modified or supplemented (including
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and, unless otherwise
provided, as in effect from time to time. The terms "cash" and "$" mean United
States Dollars. The use of the terms "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto" and words
of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section, paragraph or clause of, or Annex to, this
Agreement. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

 



\- 78 - (c) The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

(d) The accuracy or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of a party
to this Agreement shall not be affected or be deemed modified or limited by
any investigation made (or not made) by or on behalf of another party,
including any investigations made (or not made) by any of such partys
employees, advisors, agents, consultants or representatives, or by reason of
the fact that such party or any of its employees, advisors, agents,
consultants or representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation and warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue.

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent or Merger Sub may
assign this Agreement and any of their respective rights and obligations
hereunder (i) to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or (ii) to any of
their respective Financing Sources for purposes of creating a security
interest therein or otherwise assigning this Agreement and its rights and
obligations hereunder as collateral in respect of the Financing, in each case,
without the consent of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its
obligations hereunder or impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 _MOLEX INCORPORATED_

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

 

ARTICLE I. __

 

 _OFFICES_

SECTION 1. REGISTERED OFFICE. The registered office of the Corporation shall
be located in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.

 

SECTION 2. OTHER OFFICES. The Corporation may also have offices at such other
places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation
may require.

ARTICLE II.

 

 _STOCKHOLDERS_

 

SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETING. Meetings of stockholders may be held at such
place, if any, as may be designated by the Board of Directors or officers
calling such meetings.

SECTION 2. ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of the stockholders for the
election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting shall be held at such date, time and place,
if any, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors and stated in the
notice of the meeting.

 

SECTION 3. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the stockholders may be
called by the Board of Directors.

 

SECTION 4. NOTICE. A notice stating the date, time and place (if any) of the
meeting, and in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof,
shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat not less than 10
or more than 60 days prior thereto, except as otherwise required by the
Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so
addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.

Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 4 shall be effective if given by a form
of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice
is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written
notice to the Corporation and shall also be deemed revoked if (a) the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer
agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however,
the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by a form of electronic
transmission in accordance with these Bylaws shall be deemed given: (i) if by
facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when
directed to an electronic mail address at which the  stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an
electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such
specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such
separate notice; and (iv) if by another form of electronic transmission, when
directed to the stockholder. For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic
transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the
physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained,
retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly
reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 

Any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation may be given by a single
written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the
stockholders at such address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent
shall be revocable by the stockholders by written notice to the Corporation.
Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within 60
days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention
to send the single notice as set forth in this Section 4 shall be deemed to
have consented to receiving such single written notice.

 

Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed by
resolution of the Board of Directors upon notice given prior to the date
previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.

SECTION 5. ADJOURNED MEETINGS. When a meeting is adjourned, notice of the
adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place (if any) thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, if the adjournment
is for not more than 30 days, and if no new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact
only such business, which might have been transacted at the original meeting
as originally notified.

 

SECTION 6. QUORUM. The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided
by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Whether or not such quorum
is present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of
the meeting or, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation,
the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall
be present or represented, only such business which may have been transacted
at the meeting as originally notified may be transacted. Unless otherwise
required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or pursuant
to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its stockholders, when a
quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority in
voting power of shares of capital stock having voting power present in person
or represented by proxy shall decide any questions brought before such
meeting (other than the election of directors). Except as otherwise set forth
in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of the holders
of any series of Preferred Stock or any other series or class of stock to
elect additional directors under specified circumstances, at all meetings of
stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, a
plurality of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors.

 



2 SECTION 7. VOTING. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, including the rights of any holder of Preferred Stock, each
stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote
for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such
stockholder. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.

Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on
or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer
period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to
the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy
bearing a later date.

SECTION 8. FIXING OF RECORD DATE. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock
or for the purpose of any other lawful action (other than action by consent in
writing without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date:
(i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless
otherwise required by law, be not more than 60 nor less than ten days before
the date of such meeting; and (ii) in the case of any other action (other than
action by consent in writing without a meeting), shall be not more than 60
days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting) shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

 

SECTION 9. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.

 

(a) Any action to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action to be so taken, shall
be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware,

 



3  its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
are recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required
by applicable law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing, and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days
after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting: (i) when no prior action by
the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for such
purpose shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its
principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded; and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
applicable law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.

(c) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder
who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the

certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors
may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person
who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at
such election.
