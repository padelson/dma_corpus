follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.2) and  ---------- subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company (the "Merger"), the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation. Company as the surviving corporation
after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."   1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement,  ----------------------- the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing on the Closing Date (as defined in Section
1.2) a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the
"Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may
be agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate
of Merger) being the "Effective Time"). The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation, at a time and date to be specified in
writing by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in
writing (the "Closing Date").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger  -------------------- shall be as provided in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4
Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. 
------------------------------------   (a) At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect on the date hereof
and subject to the following proviso, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Cambridge Technology
Partners, Inc.".   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.   1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior  ---------------------- to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance   -2-   with the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise
provided by applicable law. The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, or as
otherwise provided by applicable law.   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this  ----------------------- Agreement, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities, the following shall occur:   (a) Conversion of Company Common
Stock. Each share of Common Stock, par 
---------------------------------- value $0.01 per share, of Company (the
"Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any share of Company Common Stock to be canceled
and extinguished pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) will be automatically converted
(subject to Sections 1.6(e) and (f)) into 0.668 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock"), which shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger Consideration." If any shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.   (b) Cancellation of
Company-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common 
----------------------------------- Stock held by Company or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.   (c) Stock Options; Earn-Out Right. At the Effective Time, all
options to  ----------------------------- purchase Company Common Stock then
outstanding under Company\'s 1998 Stock Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan,
1991 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan, Axiom
Stock Option Plan, IOS Gruppen Stock Plan and SCG Option Plan (collectively,
the "Company Option Plans"), whether vested or unvested, and the Company
Option Plans themselves, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.8. At the Effective Time, all obligations to deliver shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Earn-Out Agreement") under the Agreement for the
Purchase of the Business and Assets of OSIX Pty Ltd., dated November 3, 2000,
among the Company, Cambridge Technology Partners Pty Ltd., the Warrantors and
OSIX Pty Ltd., shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section
5.8(c) hereof.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common
Stock, $0.01 par  --------------------------- value per share, of Merger Sub
(the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate   -3-   evidencing ownership of
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange
Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted 
----------------------------- to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (f) Fractional Shares. 
-----------------   (i) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificates(s) (as defined in Section
1.7(c) hereof), receive from the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7(a)
hereof) an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, representing such holder\'s proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions
(which sale transactions shall be made at such times, in such manner and on
such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable
discretion) on behalf of all such holders of the aggregate of the fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock as applicable (the "Excess Parent Common
Stock"). The sale of the Excess Parent Common Stock by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on the Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq") and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such
sale or sales have been distributed to the former holders of Company Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds for the benefit of such
holders without liability or obligation to invest such amounts or to pay
interest thereon to such holders. Parent shall reimburse the Exchange Agent
for all reasonable commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including expenses incurred and commissions paid by the
Exchange Agent in connection with the sale of the Excess Parent Common Stock.
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which
each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if
any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to
which such former holder of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such
former holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional interests to which all former holders of shares of Company Common
Stock are entitled.   (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1.6(f)(i) hereof, Parent may elect, at its option exercised prior to the
Effective Time, and in lieu of the issuance and sale of the Excess Parent
Common Stock and the making of the payments contemplated in Section 1.6(f)(i)
hereof, to pay to the Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to pay each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by such holder) an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole  
-4-   cent) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) such fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock by (y) the average closing price of one
share of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) most recent days that Parent
Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as reported on Nasdaq.   1.7 Surrender of Certificates. 
--------------------------   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall select a  -------------- bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
the Merger.   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. As of the Effective Time,
Parent  ------------------------------ shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient for payment
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).   (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time  ------------------- (but in no event
more than five business days after the Effective Time) Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of
a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.6(f), and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d).
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company
Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a), together with payment
in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the ownership of
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been so converted (including any voting,
notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such shares of Parent
Common Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or
under Delaware Law) and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).   (d)
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Dividends or other 
------------------------------------------------ distributions declared or
made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common  
-5-   Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby when the holders of record of such
Certificates surrender such Certificates.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If
certificates representing shares of  ---------------------- Parent Common
Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
persons requesting such exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or (ii) established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the 
-------------------- Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Code or state, local or foreign law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.   (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this  ------------ Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   1.8 No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of 
--------------------------------------------------- Parent Common Stock
issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.   1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any 
-------------------------------------- Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided,
however, that the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock and the payment of cash and other distributions, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as   -6-   indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.   1.10 Tax and Accounting Consequences. 
-------------------------------   (a) It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.   (b) It is intended
by the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify as a "purchase"
transaction for accounting purposes.   1.11 Taking of Necessary Action;
Further Action. If, at any time after the 
------------------------------------------ Effective Time, any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, Company,
the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all such necessary
action.   ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to such exceptions
as are disclosed in writing in the disclosure schedules supplied by Company
to Parent dated as of the date hereof (the "Company Schedule"),
which disclosure shall provide an exception to or otherwise qualify
the representations or warranties of Company contained in the Section of
this Agreement corresponding by number to such disclosure and the
other representations and warranties herein to the extent it is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to
such other representations or warranties, as follows:   2.1 Organization of
Company.  ------------------------   (a) Company and each of its
subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; has the
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
property and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed
to be conducted; and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so
qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3) on
Company.   (b) Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete list of
all of Company\'s subsidiaries, indicating the jurisdiction of incorporation
of each subsidiary and Company\'s equity interest therein (to the extent such
entity is not wholly owned) and except for securities held by the Company and
minority ownership interests in certain of Company\'s subsidiaries held by
third parties (as described on such list of subsidiaries), there are no
outstanding equity securities, partnership interests or similar ownership
interests (or any security exchangeable or convertible into, or exercisable
for, any of the foregoing) in any subsidiary of Company.   -7-    (c)
Company has delivered or made available to Parent a true and correct copy of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company and similar governing
instruments of each of its material subsidiaries, each as in effect on the
date hereof, and each such instrument is in full force and effect.
Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
governing instruments.   2.2 Company Capital Structure. The authorized
capital stock of Company  ------------------------- consists of 250,000,000

shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Preferred
Stock"), of which there were no shares issued and outstanding as of March 11,
2001. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject
to preemptive rights created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of Company or any agreement or document to which Company is a party or
by which it is bound. As of March 11, 2001 Company had reserved an aggregate

or issuance as of March 11, 2001. All shares of Company Common Stock subject
to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified
in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, would be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has
provided to the Parent information describing option activity through March
11, 2001.   2.3 Obligations With Respect to Capital Stock. Except as set
forth in  ----------------------------------------- Section 2.2 above and in

partnership interests or similar ownership interests of any class of Company,

such equity securities (including options and warrants), partnership
interests or similar ownership interests issued, reserved for issuance or

Meetings.  ---------------------   (a) Company shall call and hold the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the

Meeting if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock necessary to
conduct business at its meeting of the stockholders. Unless Company\'s Board
of Directors has withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger in compliance with Section 5.2(c), Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger pursuant to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Company\'s obligation to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting in accordance with this Section
5.2(a) shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement,

or any change in the Board of Directors recommendation regarding the

Company shall recommend that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of and

that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this
Agreement and the Merger.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors of Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its recommendation in favor of the Merger if the Board of Directors
of Company reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify such
recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall limit Company\'s
obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (regardless
of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company shall have
been withdrawn, amended or modified).   5.3 Confidentiality; Access to
Information.  ---------------------------------------   (a) Confidentiality

reasonable notice, to its properties, books, records and personnel during the
period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its
business, including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel, as the other may reasonably request. No
information or knowledge obtained by Company or Parent in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.   5.4 No
Solicitation.  ----------------   (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VII, Company and its subsidiaries will not, nor will they
authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors, affiliates
or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement
of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate in any

facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage
in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment

Company from (A) furnishing information regarding Company and its
subsidiaries to, entering into a confidentiality agreement with or entering
into discussions with, any person or group in response to a Superior Offer
submitted by such person or group (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither Company
nor any representative of Company and its subsidiaries shall have violated
any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4, (2) the Board of
Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (3) (x) at least
two business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, Company
gives Parent written notice of the identity of such person or group and of
Company\'s intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or group and (y)
Company receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
written and oral information furnished to such person or group by or on
behalf of Company, and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing such information
to any such person or group, Company furnishes such information to Parent (to
the extent such information has not been previously furnished by Company to
Parent) (B) approving, endorsing or recommending any Superior Offer in the
event that (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to Company and not
withdrawn, (ii) neither Company nor any of its representatives shall have
violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 with respect
to such Superior Offer, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Company
reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure, in light of such Superior Offer, to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law or   -34-   (C) complying with
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to which no violation of this Section 5.4 shall have
occurred. Company and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer or
director of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a violation of this Section 5.4 by
Company. In addition to the foregoing, Company shall (i) provide Parent with
at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as
provided to the members of Company\'s Board of Directors) of any meeting of
Company\'s Board of Directors at which Company\'s Board of Directors is
reasonably expected to consider a Superior Offer together with the material
terms of such Superior Offer (including the identity of the offeror) and (ii)
provide Parent with at least three (3) business days prior written notice (or
such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of Company\'s Board of
Directors) of a meeting of Company\'s Board of Directors at which Company\'s
Board of Directors is reasonably expected to recommend a Superior Offer to
its stockholders and together with such notice a copy of the definitive
documentation relating to such Superior Offer.   For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written

less than 51% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction; (ii) a sale or other disposition by Company of all or
substantially all of its assets, or (iii) the acquisition by any person or
group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by
Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to
acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 51% of
the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company,
in each case on terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment (based on advice of its outside financial advisor) to
be more favorable to Company\'s stockholders than the terms of the Merger;
provided,  -------- however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a
"Superior Offer" if any ------- financing required to consummate the
transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed or is not likely in
the good faith judgment of Company\'s Board of Directors (after consultation
with its outside financial advisor) to be obtained by such third party on a
timely basis.   For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall
mean any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent)
relating to any Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related
transactions other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from Company by any person or
"group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding
voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group"
(as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving
Company pursuant to which the   -35-   stockholders of Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any
sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business),
acquisition or disposition of more than 15% of the assets of Company; or (C)
any liquidation or dissolution of Company.   (b) In addition to the
obligations of Company set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.4,
Company as promptly as practicable shall advise Parent orally and in writing
of any request received by Company for nonpublic information which Company
reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by Company with respect to, or
which Company reasonably believes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep Parent informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.  
5.5 Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will consult with each other, and 
----------------- to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger,
this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by law or any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange or Nasdaq, in which case reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party will be made prior to such release or public statement. The
parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the
signing of this Agreement.   5.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts;
Notification.  ---------------------------------------------   (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including to accomplish the following: (i) causing the
conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied; (ii) obtaining
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities; (iii) making all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,

any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; (v) obtaining all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties required as a result of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement; (vi) defending any suits, claims, actions, investigations or
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; (vii) executing or
delivering any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement and (viii) to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code. In connection with and   -36-   without
limiting the foregoing, subject to the other terms and conditions hereof,
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Company to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, where
the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be
satisfied as a result thereof; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.   (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained
in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in each case, where the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as a result thereof;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.   5.7
Third Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date 
-------------------- hereof, Parent and Company will each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals
under any of its or its subsidiaries\' respective material agreements,
contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and necessary to enable
the business of Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be operated
following the Closing in substantially the same matter as currently
conducted.   5.8 [Intentionally left blank.] 
------------------------    5.9 Stock Options; Employee Benefits. 
--------------------------------   (a) Stock Options. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding option to  ------------- purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") under the Company Option Plans,
whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company Stock Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions and provisions regarding the
acceleration of vesting on certain transactions, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except that (i) each Company Stock Option
will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms)
for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock   -37-   equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which
such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Parent
shall comply with the terms of all such Company Stock Options and use its
best efforts to ensure, to the extent required by and subject to the
provisions of, the Company Option Plans, and to the extent permitted under
the Code, that any Company Stock Options that qualified for tax treatment as
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective

Parties") and (ii) any indemnification provision under the Company Charter
Documents as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect

Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in
effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnified Party or of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, were employees or agents of Company, unless such modification
is required by law.   (b) For a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect a policy of directors\' and
officers\' insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by

Time, which insurance policy shall contain terms and conditions (including,
without limitation, coverage amounts) that are substantially the same as the
terms and conditions of Company\'s directors\' and officers\' insurance
policy in effect as of the date hereof; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to pay an annual
premium on such insurance policy that is greater than one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the annual premium payable under the Company\'s directors\'
and officers\' insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof; and provided
further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its
obligations under this Section 5.11(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy under
Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policy which (i) has
an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those
persons who are currently covered by Company\'s directors\' and officers\'
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, coverage amounts) that
are substantially the same as  -39-   the terms and conditions of
Company\'s directors\' and officers\' insurance policy in effect as of the
date hereof. The provisions of this Section are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the officers or directors of Company by
law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement and shall operate for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, therein,
their heirs and their representatives.   (c) In the event Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers a material amount of its properties and assets to any
person in a single transaction or a series of transactions, then, and in each
such case, Parent will either guarantee or otherwise remain liable for the
indemnification obligations referred to in this Section 5.10 or will make or
cause to be made proper provision so that the successors and assigns of
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the
indemnification obligations described herein for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties.   (d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Party may have by contract or otherwise.   5.12 Affiliate Agreements. 
---------------------   (a) Set forth in Section 5.12(a) of the Company
Schedule is a list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in Company\'s
reasonable judgment, affiliates of Company within the meaning of Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act (each, a "Company Affiliate"). Company
will provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent reasonably
requests for purposes of reviewing such list. Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to
Parent, on or as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, from each
Company Affiliate that has not delivered a Company Affiliate Agreement on or
prior to the date hereof, an executed Company Affiliate Agreement. Parent

Act (a "Company Insider").   5.15 Nasdaq Listing. Parent shall use

AFFILIATE AGREEMENT   THIS COMPANY AFFILIATE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
made and entered  --------- into as of March [__], 2001, between Neptune,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned stockholder
("Affiliate") of Ceres, Inc., a -------- Delaware corporation ("Company").
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise  ------- defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Reorganization Agreement (as defined
below).   RECITALS  --------   A. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub (as
defined below), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
(the "Reorganization Agreement")  ------------------------ which provides
for the merger (the "Merger") of Ceres Acquisition Corp., a  ------ wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), with and into the Company. 
---------- Pursuant to the Merger, all issued and outstanding common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), as of
the Effective Time  -------------------- (as defined in the Reorganization
Agreement) will be converted into common stock, par value $.10 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Common Stock") upon the  ------------------- terms and
conditions set forth in the Reorganization Agreement;   B. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Affiliate is a material inducement to Parent to
enter into the Reorganization Agreement; and   C. Affiliate has been advised
that Affiliate may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Parent after the Merger
as such term is defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). -----------   NOW,
THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   1. Acknowledgments by Affiliate. The Affiliate understands
and hereby  ---------------------------- acknowledges that the
representations, warranties and covenants by the Affiliate set forth herein
shall be relied upon by Parent, the Company and their respective legal
counsel, and that substantial losses and damages may be incurred by such
persons if the representations and warranties of the Affiliate contained
herein are inaccurate or if the convenants of the Affiliate contained herein
are breached. Affiliate has carefully read this Agreement and
the Reorganization Agreement and has had the opportunity to discuss the
requirements of this Agreement with Affiliate\'s professional advisors, who
Affiliate believes are qualified to advise Affiliate with regard to such
matters.   2. Beneficial Ownership of Company Common Stock. The Affiliate is
the sole  -------------------------------------------- beneficial owner of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock and options, warrants and rights
to purchase Company Common Stock set forth next to its name on the signature
page hereto (the "Affiliate Securities"). The Affiliate has the 
-------------------- sole right to transfer such Affiliate Securities.
The   Affiliate Securities constitute all Securities of Company owned,
beneficially or of record, by the Affiliate. The Affiliate has not engaged in
any sale or other transfer of the Affiliate Securities in contemplation of
the Merger. All shares of Company Common Stock and "Parent Common Stock"
acquired by Affiliate subsequent to the date hereof (including shares of
Parent Common Stock acquired in the Merger) shall be subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, to the extent such provisions are then still
applicable, as if held by Affiliate as of the date hereof.   3. Compliance
with Rule 145 and the Securities Act. 
-----------------------------------------------   (a) Affiliate has been
advised that (i) the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection
with the Merger is expected to be effected pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-4 filed with the Commission in accordance with the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the resale of
such shares shall be subject to restrictions set forth in Rule 145 under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145"), and (ii) Affiliate may be deemed to be an
affiliate of the Company. Affiliate accordingly agrees not to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any Parent Common Stock issued to Affiliate in the
Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made
in conformity with the requirements of Rule 145(d) promulgated under the
Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
an appropriate exemption from registration, (iii) Affiliate delivers to
Parent a written opinion of counsel, reasonably acceptable to Parent in form
and substance, that such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Securities Act or (iv) an authorized
representative of the Commission shall have rendered written advice to
Affiliate to the effect that the Commission would take no action, or that the
staff of the Commission would not recommend that the Commission take any
action, with respect to the proposed disposition if consummated (the "No
Action Correspondence").    (b) Parent shall give stop transfer
instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any Parent Common Stock
received by Affiliate in the Merger and there shall be placed on the
certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, a legend stating in
substance:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A 
TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED (A)  IN
CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(d), OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,  OR (C) IN ACCORDANCE
WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY  ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER IN
FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS  EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS  AMENDED."  The legend set forth above shall be
removed (by delivery of a substitute certificate without such legend) and
Parent shall instruct its transfer agent to remove such legend, if Affiliate
delivers to Parent (i) satisfactory written evidence that the shares have
been sold in compliance with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute
certificate shall be issued in the name of the transferee), (ii) the No  
-2-   Action Correspondence, or (iii) an opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that public sale
of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.   4.
Termination. This Agreement shall be terminated and shall be of no 
----------- further force and effect in the event of the termination of the
Reorganization Agreement pursuant to Article VII of the Reorganization
Agreement.   5. Miscellaneous.  --------------    (a) Waiver;
Severability. No waiver by any party hereto of any condition 
-------------------- or of any breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall be effective unless in writing and signed by each party hereto. In the
event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such

extraordinary character that gives each of such covenants a special, unique,
and extraordinary value; and (iii) a breach of any such covenants or any

monetary award. Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that in addition to all
other remedies available at law or in equity, Parent and the Company shall be
entitled to the immediate remedy of a temporary restraining order,
preliminary injunction, or such other form of injunctive or equitable relief
as may be used by any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin
any of the parties hereto from breaching any such covenant or provision or to
specifically enforce the provisions hereof.   (e) Governing Law. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed,  ------------- interpreted and
enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any   -3-   other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware.   (f) Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the
entire understanding  ---------------- of Affiliate and Parent relating to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings between Affiliate and Parent relating to the subject matter
hereof.   (g) Attorneys\' Fees. In the event of any legal actions or
