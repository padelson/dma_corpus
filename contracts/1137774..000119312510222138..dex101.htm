2 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS

 

Section 1.01. _Certain Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement shall have the meanings specified in  _Exhibit A_ to, or elsewhere
in, this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES AND BRIDGE LOAN

 

Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale of the Shares and Bridge Loan_. On the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing:

(a) the Parent shall, and shall cause the applicable Sellers to, sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to the Acquiror or to one or more Designated
Acquirors designated by the Acquiror no more than thirty (30) Business Days
after the date hereof, free and clear of all Liens, and the Acquiror (directly
or through one or more Designated Acquirors) shall purchase, acquire and
accept from the Parent and applicable Sellers, all of the Parents and such
applicable Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Shares;

 

(b) the Parent shall cause AIG Funding to sell, convey, assign, transfer and
deliver to the Acquiror or to one or more Designated Acquirors designated by
the Acquiror no more than thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof,
free and clear of all Liens, and the Acquiror (directly or through one or more
Designated Acquirors) shall purchase, acquire and accept from AIG Funding,
all of AIG Fundings right, title and interest in and to the Bridge Loan.

 

Section 2.02. _Closing_. On the first Business Day of the first month
immediately succeeding the month during which all the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or on such other
date as the Parent and the Acquiror may mutually agree in writing, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the
" _Closing_ ") that shall be held not later than 10:00 a.m. Tokyo time,
at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 12-32 Akasaka 1-chome,
Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-6037, or such other place or time as the Parent and the
Acquiror may agree in writing (the date on which the Closing takes place being
the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 2.03. _Purchase Price_. The total purchase price (the " _Purchase
Price_ ") for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be an
amount in cash equal to $4,800,000,000, which amount consists of (a) an amount
equal to the Bridge Loan Purchase Price for the Bridge Loan,  _plus_ (b) an
amount equal to the Purchase Price _minus_ the Bridge Loan Purchase Price for
the Shares (the " _Share Purchase Price_ "), which amount shall be adjusted
pursuant to and in accordance with this  _Section 2.03_ and _Sections 2.04_
and _2.05_. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum
of (x) the Credit Saison Debt Amount _plus_ (y) the Syndicated Loan Debt
Amount plus (z) any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries outstanding immediately prior to the Closing other

 



 

3  than the Credit Saison Debt, the Bridge Loan, the Syndicated Loan and the
AIGFAJ Subordinated Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, any such reduction to
the Purchase Price shall be treated as an adjustment to the Share Purchase
Price. The Parent shall notify the Acquiror of the principal amount of
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money outstanding as of the Closing Date and the
amount of interest (or original issue discount, as applicable) that will be
accrued and unpaid on the Bridge Loan, the Credit Saison Debt, the Syndicated
Loan and any other Indebtedness for Borrowed Money to but excluding the
Closing Date no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
For purposes of this _ARTICLE II_ , any accrued and unpaid interest (or
original issue discount, as applicable) on the Bridge Loan, the Credit Saison
Debt, and the Syndicated Loan and any principal or accrued and unpaid interest
on any other Indebtedness for Borrowed Money shall be expressed in U.S.
dollars based on the Applicable Exchange Rate as in effect as of the date
hereof.

 

Section 2.04. _Payment at Closing_.

 

(a) At the Closing, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause one or more Designated
Acquirors to, pay to the Parent (on behalf of itself and the Sellers) an
aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to _Section
2.03_) _minus_ the Closing Date Solvency Capital True-Up Amount. This payment
shall be further subject to a post-closing adjustment pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 2.05_. The Purchase Price, and any adjustment pursuant
to this _Section 2.04_ and _Sections 2.03_ and _2.05_ , shall be allocated
amongst the Parent and each of the Sellers and the assets purchased hereunder
as set forth on Section 2.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. In the event
that the Closing Date is after April 1, 2011 as a result of a failure by the
Acquiror or one or more Designated Acquirors, to obtain any approval from the
FSA necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, at the
Closing, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause a Designated Acquiror to, pay to
the Parent in cash interest on the Purchase Price for the period
commencing on April 1, 2011 and ending on the Closing Date, at a rate of 5%
per annum (such amount, if any, the " _Purchase Price Interest Amount_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.04(a)_,
neither the Acquiror nor any Designated Acquiror shall be required to pay
such Purchase Price Interest Amount if the failure of the Parent or the
Sellers to fulfill any obligations under this Agreement was the sole and
direct cause of, or solely and directly resulted in, the failure of Closing
to occur prior to April 1, 2011, provided, further that in the event the
Acquiror has incurred the obligation to pay the Purchase Price Interest
Amount, the Acquiror shall not be obligated to pay any interest for any
period during which the failure of the Parent or the Sellers to fulfill any
such obligation was the sole and direct cause of, or solely and directly
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur.

 

(b) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Parent, at its own expense, shall prepare in good faith and deliver to the
Acquiror a worksheet (the " _Estimated Companies Solvency Capital Worksheet_
") in the form attached as Section 2.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
which sets forth the Parents good faith estimate, together with explanatory
notes and supporting calculations, of the Companies Solvency Capital (the "
_Estimated Companies Solvency Capital_ ") and the Solvency Deficit (the "
_Estimated Solvency Deficit_ "), each as of the Closing Date, which Estimated
Companies Solvency Capital and Estimated Solvency Deficit shall be calculated
in accordance with the Solvency Capital Calculation Methodology. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital and
the Estimated Solvency Deficit shall be calculated and expressed in Japanese
yen.



 

4 Section 2.05. _Adjustment to Payment at Closing_.

 

(a) No later than ninety (90) days after the first statutory quarter end
following the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall prepare and deliver to the
Parent a worksheet (the " _Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet_ ") in
the form set forth in Section 2.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which
sets forth the Acquirors good faith calculation, together with explanatory
notes and supporting calculations, of the Companies Solvency Capital (the "
_Actual Closing Solvency Capital_ ") and the Solvency Deficit (the " _Actual
Solvency Deficit_ "), each as of the Closing Date, which Actual Closing
Solvency Capital and Actual Solvency Deficit shall (1) be prepared from the
books and records of the Companies and (2) be prepared in accordance with the
Solvency Capital Calculation Methodology. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the Actual Solvency Deficit shall be
calculated and expressed in Japanese yen.

 

Each party shall consult with the other party and their respective accountants
with respect to the preparation of the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital
Worksheet or the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, as applicable, and
the calculation of the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital and the Estimated
Solvency Deficit or the Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the
Actual Solvency Deficit, as applicable. Each party shall pay the fees and
expenses of any advisors retained by them in connection with the preparation
of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet; _provided_ that the Acquiror
may request that an independent certified public accounting firm of
international recognition provide an opinion or attestation with respect to
the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet; provided further that the
Acquiror shall be responsible for paying the fees and expenses of such
certified public accountant unless there is an Actual Solvency Deficit, in
which case such fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent.

 

If the Acquiror does not provide the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet
within the time period set forth in this  _Section 2.05(a)_, then, at the
election of the Parent, the Parent may prepare and present the Actual Closing
Solvency Capital Worksheet that has not been so provided within an additional
thirty (30) days thereafter.

 

(b) For purposes of this _Section 2.05_, (i) the term "preparer" shall mean
the party that prepares the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital Worksheet or
the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet and calculates the Actual
Closing Solvency Capital and the Actual Solvency Deficit or Estimated
Companies Solvency Capital and the Estimated Solvency Deficit, as the case
may be, and (ii) the term "recipient" shall mean the party that does not
prepare the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital Worksheet or the Actual
Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet or calculate the Actual Closing Solvency
Capital and the Actual Solvency Deficit or Estimated Companies Solvency
Capital and Estimated Solvency Deficit, as the case may be. Without limiting
the generality of _Section 5.03_ and subject to _Section 5.04_,
in connection with the preparers preparation of the Actual Closing Solvency
Capital Worksheet and the preparers calculation of the Actual Closing
Solvency Capital and the Actual Solvency Deficit, to the extent the preparer
does not have all reasonably necessary information in its possession, the
recipient shall (i) permit the preparer to review the recipients working
papers and other supporting data, as well as all of the books, records and
other relevant information, in each case, relating to the operations and

Capital Worksheet and the calculation of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital
and the Actual Solvency Deficit, as the case may be, in order to respond to
the reasonable inquiries of the preparer and (iii) otherwise cooperate in
good faith with the preparer.

(c) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the later of (x) the
recipients receipt of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet and (y)
if required, the date on which an Auditors Letter is executed by the
recipient and the preparers independent accountants pursuant to _Section
2.05(i)_ (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period_ "), the preparer
shall (i) permit the recipient and its Representatives to review the
preparers working papers and other supporting data, as well as all of the
books, records and other relevant information, in each case, relating to the
operations and finances of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries with
respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date, (ii) make
reasonably available the individuals in its employ responsible for, and
knowledgeable about the information used in, the preparation of the Actual
Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet and the calculation of the Actual Closing
Solvency Capital and the Actual Solvency Deficit, as the case may be, in
order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of the recipient and (iii)
otherwise cooperate in good faith with the recipient and its Representatives.

 

(d) The preparer shall, through the date that the Final Actual Closing
Solvency Capital Worksheet becomes such in accordance with  _Section
2.05(g)_, take all actions necessary or desirable to maintain and preserve all
accounting books, records, policies and procedures on which the Actual Closing
Solvency Capital Worksheet was based or on which the Final Actual Closing
Solvency Capital Worksheet is to be based so as not to impede or delay the
calculation of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the Actual Solvency
Deficit or the preparation of the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment
Disagreement or any Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet in the
manner and utilizing the methods permitted by this Agreement.

(e) The recipient shall notify the preparer in writing (the " _Notice of
Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period if the recipient disagrees with the
Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, or the calculation of the Actual
Closing Solvency Capital or the Actual Solvency Deficit. The Notice of
Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the recipients
determination of such Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, Actual
Closing Solvency Capital or Actual Solvency Deficit. If no Notice of Purchase
Price Adjustment Disagreement is received by the preparer on or prior to the
expiration date of the Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period, then the
Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, the calculation of the Actual
Closing Solvency Capital and the calculation of the Actual Solvency Deficit
shall be deemed to have been accepted by the recipient and shall become final
and binding upon the Parent and the Acquiror in accordance with _Section
2.05(g)_.

 

(f) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment
Consultation Period_ "), the Parent and the Acquiror shall seek in good faith
to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement.



 

6 (g) If, at the end of the Purchase Price Adjustment Consultation Period, the
Parent and the Acquiror have been unable to resolve all disagreements that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Purchase
Price Adjustment Disagreement, then the Parent and the Acquiror shall submit
all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Purchase
Price Adjustment Disagreement, including information that relates to items
which may not be in dispute but are relevant to the disputed matters (along
with a copy of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet marked to
indicate those line items that are in dispute) to KPMG LLP (the " _Expert
Accountant_ "). In the event that KPMG LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to
act as the Expert Accountant, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good
faith to appoint, within thirty (30) days after the Parent and the Acquiror
receive notice from KPMG LLP of its refusal or inability to act as the Expert
Accountant, an independent certified public accounting firm of
international recognition mutually agreeable to the Parent and the Acquiror,
in which event "Expert Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30)
days after the submission of such matters to the Expert Accountant, or as soon
as practicable thereafter, the Expert Accountant, acting as an expert and not
as an arbitrator, will make a final determination on the basis of the Solvency
Capital Calculation Methodology, and in accordance with this _Section
2.05(g)_, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items or the Actual
Closing Solvency Capital and the Actual Solvency Deficit in the Actual Closing
Solvency Capital Worksheet as to which the Parent and the Acquiror disagree as
specified in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement. The
determination by the Expert Accountant shall be binding on the Acquiror and
the Parent, and otherwise shall be final, non-appealable and conclusive. With
respect to each disputed line item, the Actual Closing Solvency Capital or
the Actual Solvency Deficit, as the case may be, such determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either the Parent or the Acquiror, shall not
be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated
by the recipient in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement or
the preparer of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet with respect to
such disputed line item, the Actual Closing Solvency Capital or the
Actual Solvency Deficit. For the avoidance of doubt, the Expert Accountant
shall not review any line items or make any determination with respect to any
matter other than those matters in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment
Disagreement that remain in dispute, unless the Expert Accountants review of
such other line items is relevant to the disputed matters or such review or
determination is reasonably necessary in order to resolve any disputes that
arise from line items or matters that were not initially set forth in the
Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement but that subsequently arose
as a result of the Expert Accountants review and determination of those
matters in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement that remain
in dispute (in which case, such additional line items and matters shall be
deemed to have been included in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment
Disagreement). The Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, the calculation
of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the calculation of the Actual
Solvency Deficit that are final and binding on the Parent and the Acquiror, as
determined either through agreement of the Parent and the Acquiror (deemed or
otherwise) pursuant to  _Sections 2.05(e)_ or _2.05(f)_ or through the
determination of the Expert Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.05(g)_,
are referred to herein as the " _Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital
Worksheet_ ," the " _Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital_ ," and the "
_Final Actual Solvency Deficit_." For the avoidance

 



 

7  of doubt, the Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the Final Actual
Solvency Deficit shall be calculated and expressed in Japanese yen. The 30-day
period for delivering the written award may be extended by the mutual written
consent of the Parent and the Acquiror or by the Expert Accountant for up to
an additional thirty (30) days for good cause shown. Notwithstanding anything
else contained herein, neither the Parent nor the Acquiror may assert that
any award issued by the Expert Accountant is unenforceable because it has not
been timely rendered.

 

(h) The cost of the Expert Accountants review and determination shall be
shared equally by the Parent and the Acquiror. During the review by the
Expert Accountant, the Acquiror and the Parent shall each make available to
the Expert Accountant such individuals and such information, books, records
and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Expert Accountant to
fulfill its obligations under _Section 2.05(g)_.

(i) In the event that any party to this Agreement (or the Expert Accountant)
requests, pursuant to this _Section 2.05_, access to the work papers and
other supporting data of the independent accountants of the other parties to
this Agreement relating to the preparation of the Actual Closing
Solvency Capital Worksheet or the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital
Worksheet and the calculation of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the
Actual Solvency Deficit or the Estimated Companies Solvency Capital and
Estimated Solvency Deficit, as the case may be, the providing party shall
cause its independent accountants to make any such work papers and other
supporting data available to the requesting party (including the Expert
Accountant) and its independent accountants; provided, that the requesting
party (including the Expert Accountant) has signed a customary confidentiality
and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers and
other supporting data in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants (an " _Auditor s Letter_"). The providing party
shall promptly provide any consents requested by its independent accountants
in connection with such access.

 

(j) The " _Post-Closing Solvency Capital True-Up Amount_ " will be the amount
(expressed in U.S. dollars based on the Applicable Exchange Rate as in effect
as of the Business Day immediately preceding the payment date) equal to
(whether positive or negative) (i) the Final Actual Solvency Deficit
calculated based on the Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet
(expressed in U.S. dollars based on the Applicable Exchange Rate as in effect
as of the Business Day immediately preceding the payment date), if any,
_minus_ (ii) the Closing Date Solvency Capital True-Up Amount. If the Post-
Closing Solvency Capital True-Up Amount is a negative amount, then the
Acquiror shall, or shall cause a Designated Acquiror to, pay to the Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.07_ an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-
Closing Solvency Capital True-Up Amount _plus_ interest on such amount at the
Interest Rate calculated in accordance with _Section 2.08_ from the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of payment. If the Post-Closing Solvency
Capital True-Up Amount is a positive amount, then the Parent shall pay to the
Acquiror (or to a Designated Acquiror designated by the Acquiror) pursuant to
_Section 2.07_ an amount equal to the Post-Closing Solvency Capital True-Up
Amount _plus_  interest on such amount at the Interest Rate calculated in
accordance with _Section 2.08_ from the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of payment. Such payment shall be (i) made within two (2) Business Days
after the date on which the Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, the
calculation of the Actual Closing Solvency Capital and the calculation of the
Actual Solvency Deficiency become final and binding on the Parent and the
Acquiror, as determined either 



 

8  through agreement of the Parent and the Acquiror (deemed or otherwise)
pursuant to _Section 2.05(e)_ or _2.05(f)_ or through the determination of
the Expert Accountant pursuant to  _Section 2.05(g)_, and (ii) treated as an
adjustment to the Share Purchase Price.

(k) In the event that (1) Parent has contributed capital to Star or Edison
after the date hereof as a result of a shortfall in the Solvency Margin Ratio
of Star or Edison as contemplated in _Section 5.01(z)(xxvii)_ and (2) there
is no Final Actual Solvency Deficit, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause a
Designated Acquiror to, pay to Parent on the date that would have been
applicable for a payment pursuant to the final sentence of _Section 2.05(j)_
an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of such contributed capital
or (y) the amount that could be distributed on the Closing Date by the
Insurance Company that received such contributed capital that results in the
Companies Solvency Capital to be equal to ¥554,000,000,000 as of the Closing
Date (without giving effect to any restrictions on the payment of dividends or
other distributions that may applicable to such Insurance Company).

 

Section 2.06. _Transactions; Closing Deliveries_.

 

(a) At the Closing:

 

(i) the Acquiror shall, or shall cause one or more Designated Acquirors to,

the shareholder registry of such Company, duly executed by the applicable

(iii) the Parent shall deliver, or cause its applicable Affiliates to deliver,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT

 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to the Acquiror by the Parent concurrently with
entering into this Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
understood and agreed by the parties hereto that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the Seller
Disclosure Letter to the extent it is readily apparent from such disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the disclosure of any item on Section 3.06(e)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be disclosure against
any other section of the Seller Disclosure Letter), the Parent hereby
represents and warrants to the Acquiror as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date (or such other date specified herein) as follows:

 

Section 3.01. _Incorporation, Qualification and Authority of the Parent_. The
Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to
own or lease and operate its assets and to conduct its business as currently
conducted. Each applicable Affiliate of the Parent which is a party to any
Transaction Agreement is a corporation or other organization duly incorporated
or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has full power
and authority to own or lease and operate its assets and properties and to
conduct its business as currently conducted. The Parent or the applicable
Affiliate of the Parent (as applicable) has full power and authority to enter
into, consummate the transactions contemplated by, and carry out its
obligations under, each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party.
The execution and delivery by the Parent or the applicable Affiliate of the
Parent (as applicable) of each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a
party, the performance by the Parent or the applicable Affiliate of the Parent
(as applicable) of its obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party and the consummation by the Parent or the applicable
Affiliate of the Parent (as applicable) of the transactions contemplated by
each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, have been or (in
the case of the Ancillary Agreements) will be prior to the Closing
(as applicable) duly authorized by all requisite limited liability company,
corporate or other similar organizational action on the part of the Parent or
the applicable Affiliate of the Parent (as applicable). Each of the
Transaction Agreements to which the Parent or the applicable Affiliate of the
Parent (as applicable) is a party has been, or (in the case of the Ancillary
Agreements) upon execution and delivery thereof, will be, duly executed and
delivered by the Parent or the applicable Affiliate of the Parent (as
applicable). Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties hereto or thereto, each of the Transaction Agreements to which the
Parent or the applicable Affiliate of the Parent (as applicable) is a party
constitutes, or (in the case of the Ancillary Agreements) upon execution and
delivery thereof will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Parent or the applicable Affiliate of the Parent (as applicable),
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, preferential
transfer or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
the effect of general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

good standing (or the equivalent, if any, in the applicable jurisdiction)
under the Laws of Japan and has full power and authority to own or lease and
operate its assets and properties and to conduct its business as currently
conducted. Neither the character of the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries owned, operated or leased assets or properties nor the nature of
their activities require that any of them be qualified as a foreign
corporation or other organization in any other jurisdiction besides Japan,
except where the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Parent has delivered or made available to the Acquiror, prior to the date
hereof, true, correct and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) for each of the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries (as applicable).

or regulatory interpretations thereof.

Subsidiaries; Ownership and Transfer of the Shares_.

respects material to its use or operation, except for any defects which would
not materially impair the use or occupancy of such Leased Real Property. A
Company or a Transferred Subsidiary, as the case may be, enjoys peaceful and

acceptable to the Acquiror and the Parent, with any one or more of the
Acquiror and its Affiliates with respect to any information to be provided to
the Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 5.02(b)_. The
Parent shall reimburse the Acquiror and its Affiliates promptly for any
reasonable and necessary third party out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Acquiror and its Affiliates and any such Persons Representatives in
complying with any request by or on behalf of the Parent or its
Representatives in connection with this _Section 5.02(b)_. The Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) from and against any Losses
that may be incurred by any of them arising out of or related to the use,
storage or handling by the Parent, and its Representatives of (1) any
personally identifiable information relating to employees, Brokers,
policyholders or customers of the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) and (2) any other information that
is protected by applicable Law (including privacy Laws) or Contract and to
which the Parent, and its Representatives is afforded access pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement solely to the extent any such Losses are the result of
the actions or omissions of the Parent or its Representatives.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, in connection with (i) the preparation of
financial statements required to be prepared under applicable Law or stock
exchange rules or for other bona fide reporting purposes, (ii) the preparation
of filings and submissions to

 



 

52  Governmental Authorities, (iii) the conduct of any litigation, (iv) the
transfer of any Permits, (v) any applicable Governmental Orders, (vi) the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to any of the Transaction
Agreements or (vii) compliance with applicable Law, upon reasonable prior
notice (or, with respect to access to employees, as may otherwise be agreed to
by the parties), the Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
(A) afford the Acquiror and the Representatives of the Acquiror reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the offices, properties, books, data,
files, information, records and employees of the Parent and its Affiliates in
respect of the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business and
their personnel, (B) furnish to the Acquiror and the Representatives of the
Acquiror such additional financial data and other information regarding the
Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business and their personnel
as the Acquiror or its Representatives may from time to time reasonably
request and (C) other than for proceedings involving the Parent and its
Affiliates, use reasonable efforts to make available to the Acquiror and the
Representatives of the Acquiror, the employees of the Parent and its
Affiliates in respect of the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Business and their personnel whose assistance, expertise, testimony, notes
and recollections or presence is necessary to assist the Acquiror or its
Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the Acquirors or such
Affiliates or Representatives inquiries for any of the purposes referred to
in this _Section 5.02(c)_, including the presence of such persons as
witnesses in hearings or trials for such purposes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require the Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to disclose any information to the Acquiror or the
Representatives of the Acquiror or take any action that would cause a
violation of any Contract to which the disclosing party or any of its
Affiliates is a party, would cause a risk of loss of legal privilege to the
party disclosing such data or information or any of its Affiliates, or would
constitute a violation of applicable Law or obligations to customers, so long
as the Parent and/or its Affiliates or Representatives, as the case may be,
shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
information and protect such privacy and any personal data without violation
of applicable Law or obligations to customers; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Parent or any of its Affiliates; and _provided_ , _further_
, that the auditors and independent accountants of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to any
Person unless and until such Person has signed a customary Auditors Letter
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such auditors or independent accountants. The Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide any consent requested by their
respective independent accountants in connection with such access. If so
reasonably requested by the Parent, the Acquiror shall enter into a customary
joint defense agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Acquiror and the Parent, with any one or more of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates with respect to any information to be provided to the Acquiror or
its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 5.02(c)_. The Acquiror shall
reimburse the Parent and its Affiliates promptly, in cash, for any reasonable
and necessary third party out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Parent or
any of its Affiliates and any such Persons Representatives in complying with
any request by or on behalf of the Acquiror or its Representatives in
connection with this _Section 5.02(c)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the provisions of _Section
5.02(a)_, _Section 5.02(b)_ and  _Section 5.02(c)_ above shall not apply to
any matter relating to Taxes or Tax Returns as all such matters are governed
exclusively by the provisions set forth in _Article VII_.

 



 

53 Section 5.03. _Books and Records_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03(b)_ and _Article VII_, the Parent and its
Affiliates shall have the right to retain copies of all books, data, files,
information and records in any media (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Tax Returns and other information and documents relating to Tax matters) of
each of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (i)
relating to information (including employment and medical records) regarding
the Employees, (ii) as required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to
applicable Law or as may be requested thereby or (iii) as may be necessary for
the Parent and its Affiliates to perform their respective obligations pursuant
to the Transaction Agreements, in each case subject to compliance with
all applicable privacy Laws, policies and obligations of the Companies and
the Transferred Subsidiaries made to the past, present or prospective
customers, claimants, beneficiaries, employees or agents and with the Parents
and its Affiliates existing preservation and retention policies and
obligations; _provided_ that the applicable books, data, files, information
and records retained pursuant to clause (iii) shall be delivered to the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries at the Parents and its
Affiliates expense once they are no longer needed for the Parent and its
Affiliates to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction
Agreements. With respect to all original Books and Records of each of the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date,
the Acquiror shall, and shall cause each of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to, (A) comply in all material respects with all applicable
Law, including the Code, relating to the preservation and retention of
records, (B) apply preservation and retention policies that are no less
stringent than those generally applied by the Acquiror and (C) for seven (7)
years after the Closing Date or until written notice is received from the
Parent of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for Japanese
Tax purposes, whichever is earlier, preserve and retain all such original
books, data, files, information and records solely to the extent required
under applicable Law for Tax purposes and thereafter to dispose of such
original books, data, files, information and records only after it shall have
given the Parent ninety (90) days prior written notice of such disposition
and the opportunity (at the Parents expense) to remove and retain such
information (which shall be treated as confidential information); _provided_
that the Acquiror shall have no such obligation to provide such original
books, data, files, information and records to the extent that doing so would
violate applicable Law, violate any commitments in privacy policies or
obligations made with respect to privacy or result in the waiver of any
attorney-client privilege.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other
Transaction Agreement, to the extent that the Parent or its Affiliates may
possess books, records, files, tapes, software, documents or other materials
(i) containing both data relating to the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries and data relating to the Parent and its Affiliates (other than
the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries), (ii) that are not used in the
operation of, or necessary to, the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted, (iii) that have been or will be retained pursuant to applicable
Law or for regulatory purposes, including pursuant to a Litigation Hold or
otherwise, (iv) the possession of which by the Parent would not violate any
privacy policies or legal or contractual obligations of the Companies and
the Transferred Subsidiaries



 

54  with respect to privacy, (v) with respect to which, to the Knowledge of the
Parent, the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries have duplicate copies of
any data relating to the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, and (vi)
with respect to which it would not be commercially reasonable for the Parent
to separate such data, books, records, files, tapes, software, documents, or
other materials relating to the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries
from such data and materials relating to the Sellers, the Parent, or any of
their respective Affiliates (other than the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries) (" _Archived Files_ "), the parties agree that the Archived
Files are not the property of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries
and are not sold, transferred or conveyed pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement. The Parent agrees that it shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, maintain and treat any data in such duplicate Archived
Files in accordance with _Section 5.04_ as if such Archived Files are the
Other Partys Confidential Information and shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, maintain and dispose of such Archived Files in accordance with
applicable Law. The Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide
the Acquiror, at the Acquirors expense, reasonable access to the Archived
Files relating to the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries during normal
business hours, to the extent that such Archived Files have not been disposed
according to this _Section 5.03_.

 

Section 5.04. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The confidentiality provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated
November 25, 2008, between the Parent and Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") are incorporated into this Agreement by
reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing
(notwithstanding any prior expiration in accordance with their terms that
would otherwise occur), at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate and become void with no liability on the part of any party thereto
except for liabilities that arose prior to the Closing. If, for any reason,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Parent and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Acquiror and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, maintain in
confidence, and not use or exploit for any purpose other than in connection
with fulfilling their respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements,
any written, oral or other information relating to or obtained from the other
party or its Affiliates, or in the case of the Parent and its Affiliates, all
confidential documents and information concerning the Companies, the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business (the " _Other Party s Confidential
Information_"), except to the extent that (i) any such Other Partys
Confidential Information is or becomes generally available to the public other
than (A) in the case of information relating to the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries or relating to or obtained from the Acquiror, its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, as a result of
disclosure by the Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives of such information and (B) in the case of information
relating to or obtained from the Parent, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives, as a result of disclosure by the Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives of such
information, (ii) the Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, is, upon the advice of
legal counsel, legally compelled to disclose any such Other Partys



 

55  Confidential Information (including any report, statement, testimony or
other submission to a Governmental Authority) pursuant to applicable Law or
any Governmental Order, or by such Governmental Authority, after prior
written notice has been given to the Parent, in the case of compelled
disclosure by the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, or to the Acquiror, in
the case of compelled disclosure by the Parent or any of its
Affiliates, provided that no such notice is required if prohibited by
applicable Law, (iii) any such Other Partys Confidential Information is
reasonably necessary to be disclosed in connection with any Action, or in any
dispute, with respect to the Transaction Agreements (including in response to
any summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal
investigative demand issued to the disclosing party in the course of any
Action, investigation or administrative proceeding), (iv) any such Other
Partys Confidential Information was or becomes available to such party on a
non-confidential basis and from a source (other than a party hereto or any
Affiliate or Representative of such party) that is not bound by
a confidentiality agreement with respect to such Other Partys Confidential
Information or (v) after the Closing any such Other Partys Confidential
Information becomes known or available pursuant to or as a result of the
carrying out of the provisions of any Ancillary Agreement (which information
shall be governed by the confidentiality provisions set forth in such
Ancillary Agreement). In the event that the Parent or any of its Affiliates,
on the one hand, or the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
becomes legally compelled to disclose any such Other Partys Confidential
Information, the Acquiror, and the Parent, as the case may be, as the
disclosing party, shall cooperate with the party whose information is being
disclosed (at such disclosing partys expense) to obtain a protective order or
similar remedy to cause such Other Partys Confidential Information not to be
disclosed, including interposing all available objections thereto, such as
objections based on settlement privilege. In the event that such protective
order or other similar remedy is not obtained, the disclosing party shall
furnish only that portion of such Other Partys Confidential Information
that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such disclosed information. Each of the Acquiror and the Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, protect such Other
Partys Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less
than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of
such Other Partys Confidential Information as the Acquiror or the Parent, as
the case may be, used to protect its own confidential information prior to the
date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any
information about the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries after
the Closing. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and
Representatives having access to such information of such obligation of
confidentiality. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties may disclose
information about the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any facts or materials relating
thereto or reasonably necessary to understand such treatment or structure).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Parent, and its Representatives may,
without notifying the Acquiror or any other Person, share any information
relating to or obtained from any of the Acquiror or its Affiliates with (i)
subject to the terms and conditions of the Nondisclosure Agreement, dated
September 25, 2008, between the FRBNY and the Parent (the " _FRBNY NDA_ ") as
in effect on the date hereof, the FRBNY and its Representatives, (ii) the
U.S. Treasury



 

56  and its Representatives and (iii) the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and its Representatives (the Persons identified in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) collectively, the " _Government Recipients_ "), in each case
as the Parent deems may be reasonably necessary or advisable in its good faith
judgment; _provided_ , that the Parent shall, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, request confidential treatment of any of the information
included therein and shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to enforce the
FRBNY NDA with respect to any such information that the Parent may disclose to
the FRBNY; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that this provision shall not apply to
any information regarding Taxes, or any matters relating to Taxes, other than
with respect to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent shall promptly notify the Acquiror
in the event the Parent learns that any Government Recipient has been
requested or required to disclose any such information or has taken any action
that, if taken by the Parent, would be deemed a breach of this  _Section
5.04_.

Section 5.05. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Reasonable Best
Efforts_. 

(a) Each of the Acquiror and the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable any Governmental Approvals
that are necessary, proper or advisable (whether so necessary, proper or
advisable prior to, at or after the Closing) under the Transaction Agreements
and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Each of the Acquiror
and the Parent shall cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in
seeking to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all such Governmental
Approvals. Neither the Acquiror nor the Parent shall take or cause to be
taken any action that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any such required
Governmental Approval.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.05(a)_, the Acquiror and
the Parent shall each as promptly as reasonably practicable make all filings
and notifications with all Governmental Authorities that are necessary, proper
or advisable (whether so necessary, proper or advisable prior to, at or after
the Closing) under the Transaction Agreements and applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, including (i) filing change of control applications or disclaimers
of control, as appropriate, with applicable Governmental Authorities in
each jurisdiction where required by applicable Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (which may include, in
the case of the Acquiror, a filing with the FSA to permit the Acquiror (or a
Designated Acquiror) to become either (A) a "major shareholder" of each of
the Insurance Companies, or (B) an "insurance holding company," in each case
as such term is defined in the Insurance Business Law), (ii) filing market
share notifications in each jurisdiction where required by applicable
Insurance Law, and (iii) making any filing that is necessary, proper or
advisable (whether so necessary, proper or advisable prior to, at or after the
Closing) under any antitrust, competition, privacy, data protection,
insurance or other regulatory Law or by any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust, competition,
privacy, data protection, insurance or other regulatory Laws (including
"prior consultation" with the Fair Trade Commission of Japan). Each such party
shall supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with
the filings referred to in this _Section 5.05_, and to seek early
termination of any applicable waiting periods thereunder. The Parent (or its
Affiliates), on the one hand, and the Acquiror (or its Affiliates), on the
other hand, shall share equally the filing fees associated with any required
filings.



 

57 (c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this _Section
5.05_, each of the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other
hand, shall take or cause to be taken the following actions: (i) the prompt
provision to a Governmental Authority of non-privileged information,
documents or testimony requested by such Governmental Authority or that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; (ii) the prompt use of its
reasonable best efforts to oppose any Action relating to the Transaction
Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby in order to avoid the
entry of or to effect the dissolution of any permanent, preliminary
or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or
judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements,
including (A) use of its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation
on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding
by any Person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions and (B) enter into an agreement with any Governmental Authority
by the Acquiror to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease,
license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines,
licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations or interests
therein of any of the Companies or the Acquiror or their
respective Subsidiaries to the extent such agreement is required by any
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements in accordance with the terms of the Transaction
Agreements; and (iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take,
in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued in any proceeding or
inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements in accordance with the terms of the
Transaction Agreements unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, any and all steps (including the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by clause (ii) of this  _Section 5.05(c)_) reasonably necessary to resist,
vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination
or decree so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as
possible to that contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates be
required under this _Section 5.05_ to commence, threaten or otherwise seek
to commence any claim, action, suit, arbitration or proceeding against any
Governmental Authority listed on Section 5.05(c) of the Acquiror Disclosure
Letter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
the Acquiror, any Designated Acquiror, any of the Sellers, the Parent, any of
the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be required to take
any action under this _Section 5.05(c)_ pursuant to, or otherwise agree to
or accept, any condition or restriction (A) that would not customarily be
imposed in transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, (B) that is not conditioned on the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements in accordance
with the terms of the Transaction



 

58  Agreements, (C) that requires the taking of any action, including an
amendment of any Transaction Agreement or the sale, lease, license, disposal
or holding separate by any of the Companies or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries of any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of
assets or business or other operations or interests therein that would
materially adversely affect the economic benefits reasonably expected to
be derived by the Acquiror, and the Parent, under the Transaction Agreements
or in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereunder; provided that, in the event that a Governmental Authority requires
that the terms of the Transaction Agreements be changed or altered in a
manner that adversely affects any such benefits reasonably expected to be
derived thereunder, each of the Acquiror and the Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts and cooperate and negotiate in good faith to agree to
alternative terms to the Transaction Agreements that are acceptable to such
Governmental Authority and provide benefits substantially similar to the
benefits provided under the original terms thereof, (D) that
materially adversely affect the ability of the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries), taken as a whole,
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, to conduct
its business in the same manner as such business is being conducted, including
by requiring the sale, lease, license, disposal or holding separate of any
assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or business or
other operations or interests therein, if such sale, lease, license, disposal
or holding separate would materially adversely affect such ability to conduct
such business in the manner as such business is currently being conducted or
(E) that would otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect or would reasonably be
expected to have, directly or indirectly, a material adverse effect on the
business, operations (including results of operations), assets, liabilities,
properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of Prudential Financial, Inc.
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, as applicable (the conditions or
restrictions described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) above, the "
_Negative Conditions or Restrictions_ ").

(d) Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall (i)
promptly notify each other of any communication it or any of its Affiliates
receives from any Governmental Authority, (ii) permit the other parties to
review, in advance to the extent practicable, any material proposed
communication by such party or any of its Affiliates to any Governmental
Authority, (iii) consult with the other parties in connection with any such
proposed communication to the extent practicable and (iv) provide each other
with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
such party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority or members of the staff of any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, in each case to the extent relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement. None of the Acquiror, the
Parent, any of the Sellers, any of the Companies, any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority relating
to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with
the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority or otherwise practicable, gives the other parties the opportunity to
attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and to this _Section 5.05(d)_, the Parent and the
Acquiror shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other parties may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall



 

59  not require the Acquiror, the Parent, any of the Sellers, any of the
Companies, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives (i) to disclose any information that in the
reasonable judgment of the Acquiror, the Parent, any of the Sellers, any of
the Companies, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the disclosure of any Trade
Secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or privacy or (ii) to disclose any privileged information or
confidential competitive information of the Acquiror, the Parent, any of
the Sellers, any of the Companies, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Affiliates (as the case may be); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the parties obligations to notify the other parties with
respect to communications received from a Tax Authority, as well as the
rights and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to any matter
related to Taxes, shall be governed solely by _ARTICLE VII_ ; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that none of the parties shall be required to comply with any
provision of this _Section 5.05(d)_ to the extent that such compliance would
be prohibited by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any materials or information may be withheld or redacted to
the extent that they are protected by professional privilege rules (including
attorney-client privilege) or as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements or applicable Law.

 

(e) The Acquiror and the Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts
to timely obtain any approval, consent, license, sublicense, permit, waiver,
order, qualification or authorization with respect to (i) any Material
Contracts, Reinsurance Contracts, Broker Contracts, Real Estate Venture
Documents, Loan Interest Documents and the Contracts set forth on Section
5.05(e)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Specified
Contracts_ ") as a result of such Specified Contracts containing a "change in
control" or other similar provision or (ii) any Contracts between the Parent
or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and a third party, required for the provision, under the
Transition Services Agreement, of Services or access to Facilities (each, a "
_Third Party Consent_ "), in each case, with the other partys participation
and cooperation; provided, however, that the Parent may request the Acquirors
consent not to seek a required approval, consent, license, sublicense,
permit, waiver, order, qualification or authorization with respect to any
Specified Contract, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Parent,
on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall pay the costs of
all Third Party Consents and any "kill fees" or other penalties (including
penalties for unused minimum volume commitments) in connection with procuring
any such Third Party Consent in equal proportions. In the event that the
Parent cannot obtain any Third Party Consent prior to Closing, the Parent and
the Acquiror (A) shall, with respect to Contracts contemplated by clauses (i)
or (ii) above to which the Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) is a party, use their reasonable
best efforts to provide or cause to be provided to the other party or parties
or its or their Affiliates, as the case may be, the benefits, and the costs
and expenses, of any such Contract, for not longer than the remainder of the
term of such Contract, to the extent permitted thereunder and (B) shall use
reasonable best efforts to secure, and with respect to any Contracts for which
a Third Party Consent is required to provide Services and access to
Facilities under the Transition Services Agreement or to prevent termination
of such Contract by a third party, shall secure, an alternative arrangement
designed to reasonably provide, where necessary, the operational equivalents
of the Intellectual Property, products, services or benefits provided pursuant
to such Contract, for not longer than the remainder of the term of such
Contract, for which the Third 



 

60  Party Consent was not obtained, _provided_ , that the present value of the
costs and expenses of such provision of benefits or alternative arrangement
(other than attorneys fees or fees for consultants advising on such
alternative arrangement) in excess of the costs and expenses that would have
been incurred pursuant to such Contract had such Third Party Consent been
obtained at no cost, shall be borne by the Acquiror, on the one hand, and the
Parent, on the other hand, in equal proportion; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the alternative arrangement provides for the Contract to be provided for a
longer period of time than would have been provided for if the Third Party
Consent had been obtained, the Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the
costs not reasonably attributable to the term of service under the original
Contract had the Third Party Consent been obtained. In no event shall the
Parent be required to commence, or threaten or otherwise seek to commence,
any claim, action, suit, arbitration or proceeding to obtain any Third Party
Consent. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the terms "approval,"
"consent," "license," "sublicense," "permit," "waiver," "order,"
"qualification" or "authorization" when used in this _Section 5.05(e)_ shall
in no way be construed to mean an "approval," "consent," "license,"
"sublicense," "permit," "waiver," "order," "qualification" or "authorization"
from a Governmental Authority except to the extent such Governmental
Authority is a counterparty to any third party Contract with the Acquiror, the
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates and (2) the provision of benefits
or alternative arrangements may include assignment of a Contract or portion
of a Contract if such Contract or portion of such Contract is solely related
to the Business and such assignment would not prevent the Acquiror, the Parent
or their respective Affiliates from performing their obligations under any
Transaction Agreement.

Section 5.06. _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by the Parents, or its Affiliates
(other than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) (as the case may
be) blanket insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs in
place to the extent such insurance policies or programs cover any of the
Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries. From and after the Closing
Date, if any of the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries reports a
claim solely arising out of its operations covered by the Parents, or
its Affiliates insurance policies, the Companies, the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the Acquiror will fully satisfy the deductible or retention
applicable to such claim.

 

(b) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
that are covered by occurrence-based third party liability insurance policies
of the Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and any third party workers compensation insurance policies or
comparable workers compensation self-insurance programs sponsored by the
Parent or its Affiliates and that apply to the locations at which the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries operate their respective
businesses, the Acquiror may, and may cause the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to make claims under such policies and programs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that by making any such claims, the Acquiror agrees to reimburse
the Parent, in cash, for any increased costs incurred by the Parent, or its
Affiliates as a result of such claims, including any retroactive or
prospective premium adjustments associated with such coverage, as such amounts
are determined in accordance with those policies and programs generally
applicable from time to time to the Parent or its Affiliates; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that

 



 

61  neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall make any such claims
if, and to the extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies
issued or sponsored by the Acquiror or its Affiliates. As of the third
anniversary of the date hereof, the Acquiror shall no longer be permitted to
report claims with respect to such occurrence-based third party liability
insurance policies of the Parent or its Affiliates or to any such workers
compensation insurance policies or comparable workers compensation self-
insurance programs that apply to the locations at which the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries operate their respective businesses, and the
Acquiror shall assume full responsibility for, and release the Parent and its
Affiliates from, all liability for such claims, known or unknown, resulting
from occurrences prior to the Closing Date, other than any Losses with respect
to which any Acquiror Indemnified Party is entitled to recovery under any
Transaction Agreement.

Section 5.07. _Intercompany Obligations and Arrangements_.

(a) The Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions and
make such payments so that prior to the Closing Date, the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Parent and its Affiliates
(other than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, shall settle, discharge, offset, pay, repay in full, terminate, commute
or extinguish all outstanding intercompany receivables and payables (other
than any principal or interest owed under the Bridge Loan), including any
accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of payment; _provided_
, _however_ , that this _Section 5.07(a)_ shall not apply to any intercompany
receivables or payables (i) arising under any Intercompany Agreement set forth
on Section 5.07(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, or (ii) arising under any
Insurance Agreement. To the extent that the amount of any intercompany
receivable or payable cannot be settled, discharged, offset, paid, repaid in
full, terminated, commuted or extinguished concurrently with the Closing in
accordance with the preceding sentence (whether as a result of contractual or
legal restrictions or otherwise), such amount (plus any accrued and unpaid
interest) shall be paid in full following the Closing by, as the case may be,
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, within 10 days of receipt of an invoice
detailing the amount due with respect to such outstanding intercompany
receivable or payable (but in no event later than 30 days after the Closing
Date); provided such intercompany receivables or payables are reflected in the
Estimated Companies Solvency Capital Worksheet. The Parent shall notify the
Acquiror, at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing if the Parent
becomes aware of any intercompany receivable or payable that cannot be
settled, discharged, offset, paid, repaid in full, terminated, commuted or
extinguished concurrently with the Closing.

(b) The Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions as
may be necessary to terminate or commute, effective on or prior to the Closing
Date, all Intercompany Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
5.07(b)_ shall not apply to (i) any Intercompany Agreement set forth on
Section 5.07(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter or (ii) any Insurance
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.07(b)_ shall not apply
to (1) any Contract between a third party, on the one hand, and the Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, to which a Company or Transferred
Subsidiary is not a party, but under which a Company and/or a Transferred
Subsidiary may otherwise derive benefits, such as enterprise-wide licenses or
"master" agreements, or (2) any Contract among (x) a third party, (y) the
Parent or any of its Affiliates, and (z) any Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary. All of such Contracts 



 

62  are governed exclusively by _Section 5.05(e)_. If any Intercompany
Agreement provides that any term or condition survives its expiration or
termination, this Agreement hereby modifies and amends such Intercompany
Agreement to cancel and negate such survival; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to any term or condition that imposes
confidentiality obligations. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to
execute additional documents and take further actions to accomplish the
foregoing.

 

Section 5.08. _Guarantees_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.13_, from and after the date of this Agreement, the
parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, on or
prior to the Closing, the termination of, and full release of the Parent, the
Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates (including the Companies and
the Transferred Subsidiaries) from any and all obligations arising under, any
and all guarantees, keepwells, letters of credit, indemnity or contribution
agreements, support agreements, insurance surety bonds or other similar
agreements (excluding Insurance Contracts) made in respect of the obligations
of, or for the benefit of any obligee of, (i) the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries by the Parent, the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) or (ii)
the Parent, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) by the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries (each, a " _Guaranty_ ," and each party obligated
thereunder, a " _Guarantor_ "), in each case, as set forth in Section 5.08 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter.

(b) With respect to the general guarantee agreement, dated as of August 29,
2003, made by American Home Assurance Company on behalf of Edison, the general
guarantee agreement dated as of August 20, 2003, made by Lexington Insurance
Company on behalf of Edison and any other Guaranty for which the parties do
not obtain termination and a full release of the Guarantor from any and all
obligations arising under such Guaranty, the Acquiror, or an Affiliate of the
Acquiror with the Parents consent, or the Parent, as applicable shall,
concurrently with the Closing, enter into a Hold Harmless Agreement with
respect to such Guaranty.

 

Section 5.09. _Non Competition; Non Solicitation; No Hire_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the day following the Closing Date and ending on
the two year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
each Parent Entity shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror, directly or indirectly, engage in the Restricted Business.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.09(a)_, and
without implication that the following activities (or activities not listed
below) otherwise would be subject to the provisions of _Section 5.09(a)_,
nothing in _Section 5.09(a)_ shall preclude, prohibit or restrict or
otherwise limit any Parent Entity from engaging, or require the Parent to
cause the Parent or any Parent Entity not to engage, in any manner in any of
the following:

(i) consummating the transactions or providing or receiving the services
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;



 

63 (ii) engaging in (A) the business of marketing, underwriting, issuing and

does so as of the date of this Agreement;

(iv) acquiring, holding investments or owning, directly or indirectly, any
voting stock, Capital Stock or any other equity interest (including

which ownership interest represents at all times not more than 10% of the
aggregate voting power or outstanding Capital Stock or other equity interests
of such Person; _provided_ , that such percentage shall be not more than 25%
if such ownership interest is acquired by any Parent Entity as consideration
for the disposition of any Parent Entity; and _provided_ , _further_ that such
acquisition or ownership is and remains during the Non-Compete Period solely
for investment purposes;

 

(v) engaging directly or indirectly in any Restricted Business by acquiring,
holding investments or owning, directly or indirectly, Capital Stock or any
other equity interest (including convertible securities) of FFM or TDH;

(vi) entering into alliances or joint ventures that engage in a Restricted
Business so long as the GAAP pre-tax operating income derived by the
activities, services or businesses contributed by a Parent Entity and the
other party or parties to such alliance or joint venture attributable to the
portion of the Restricted Business constituted less than 10% of the
consolidated GAAP pre-tax operating income (excluding any effects attributable
to short-term and extraordinary events) of such activities, services or
businesses contributed by a Parent Entity and the other party or parties to
such alliance or joint venture (or, in the event that such Acquired Entity is
not a separate Person, the consolidated GAAP pre-tax operating
income attributable to the assets and liabilities used in connection with the
Restricted Business constituted less than 10% of the consolidated GAAP pre-tax
operating income (excluding any effects attributable to short-term and
extraordinary events) attributable to the assets and liabilities transferred
as part of such Acquisition Transaction);

(vii) entering into alliances or joint ventures involving the distribution of
Non-Restricted Products through the distribution platform of a Person that
engages in Restricted Business or the distribution of products of such other
Person through the distribution platform of a Parent Entity;

(viii) if it is a Covered Business that has completed a Spin-Off Transaction,
engaging in any business in any jurisdiction;

(ix) managing, controlling, advising or providing administrative or similar
services to general or separate accounts of insurance companies, investment

64  or other investment vehicles or any employee benefit plan or trust of any
Parent Entity that makes investments in Persons engaging in a Restricted
Business, so long as such investments are in the Ordinary Course of Business
of such fund, vehicle, plan or trust;

(x) providing investment management, investment advisory, administrative or
similar services to any Person; and

(xi) selling, distributing, marketing, underwriting or otherwise providing
any products or services in the Ordinary Course of Business to a Person
engaged in a Restricted Business.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
5.09_, the covenant set forth in  _Section 5.09(a)_ shall not be breached by
reason of a Parent Entity entering into any agreement to acquire or acquiring,
or after such acquisition, owning and operating, in whole or in part, any
Person or any asset or business that, directly or indirectly, engages in any
Restricted Business (any such Person or business, an " _Acquired Entity_ " and
such transaction and any related series of transactions, an " _Acquisition
Transaction_ ");  _provided_ , that (x) the Parent provides to the Acquiror
prompt written notice of the entry into such agreement or the consummation of
such Acquisition Transaction (whichever first occurs), which notice shall
identify the Acquired Entity and the Restricted Business in which such
Acquired Entity engages and (y) such Parent Entity satisfies any one of the
Acquisition Conditions set forth below. For purposes of this _Section
5.09(c)_, each of the following shall constitute an " _Acquisition Condition_
":

(i) within 12 months after the closing or effective date (the " _Transaction
Date_ ") of such Acquisition Transaction, the Restricted Business (or the
assets used in connection therewith) of such Acquired Entity are disposed of
to a Person that is not an Affiliate of any Parent Entity; 

(ii) within 12 months after the Transaction Date of such Acquisition
Transaction, such Acquired Entity ceases to engage in the Restricted
Business; or

(iii) (A) a principal purpose of such Acquisition Transaction is not to
circumvent the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.09_; (B) during the
four most recently completed full quarters preceding the Transaction Date, the

the Restricted Business constituted less than 20% of the consolidated GAAP

GAAP pre-tax operating income (excluding any effects attributable to short-
term and extraordinary events) attributable to the assets and liabilities
transferred as part of such Acquisition Transaction); and (C) from and after
the Transaction Date of such Acquisition Transaction, the Parent Entities
(other than the Acquired Entity to the extent set forth in this _Section
5.09(c)(iii)_) remain subject to this _Section 5.09_.

 



 

65 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
5.09_, the covenant set forth in _Section 5.09(a)_ shall not be breached by
reason of any of the following:

(i) any Person engaged in the Restricted Business agreeing to hold or
holding, or agreeing to acquire or acquiring, directly or indirectly, voting

Entity_ " and such transaction, a " _Change of Control Transaction_ ");

 

(ii) following a Spin-Off Transaction, any Person engaged in the Restricted
Business agreeing to acquire or acquiring, directly or indirectly, voting
securities of the Covered Business that is the subject of such Spin-Off
Transaction, whether by means of a stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
tender offer or otherwise (such Person, an " _Acquiring Entity_ " and such
transaction, a " _Spin-Off Change of Control Transaction_ "); or

(iii) if a Spin-Off Transaction shall not have occurred, any Person engaged
in the Restricted Business agreeing to acquire or acquiring, directly or
indirectly, all or a material portion of any Covered Business from the Parent
or one of its Affiliates, whether by means of a stock or asset purchase,
merger, consolidation, reinsurance transaction, tender offer or otherwise
(such Person, an " _Acquiring Entity_ " and such transaction, which for the
avoidance of doubt shall not include a Spin-Off Transaction, a " _Covered
Business Sale_ ");

_provided_ , that, in each case, the Parent or the Covered Business, as
applicable, provides to the Acquiror prompt written notice of the entry into
such agreement or the consummation of such Change of Control/Sale Transaction
(whichever first occurs), which notice shall identify the Acquiring Entity and
the Restricted Business in which such Acquiring Entity engages.

(e) During the Restricted Period, the Parent shall not, and shall cause the
other Parent Entities not to, without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ or retain the
services of (i) any employee of the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary, (ii) any employee of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates whose
primary job duties consist of transition, migration, and integration of the
Business, such employees to be designated in writing by the Acquiror prior to
the Closing Date and consented to by the Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), (iii) any former employee of any Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary who, from or after the Closing Date, voluntarily
terminated his or her employment with such Company or Transferred Subsidiary
or whose employment is terminated for material misconduct or failure to
substantially perform his or her duties for a period of six months following
such termination or (iv) any employee of the Parent or any of its Affiliates
who is required to be transferred to one of the Companies or one of the
Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, whether or not such
employee is so transferred; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
otherwise provided in clause (iii), the Parent and its Affiliates may employ
or hire any such Person who is terminated by any Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary after the Closing Date, _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this  _Section 5.09(e)_, for any person covered by clause
(iii), any restrictions under this _Section 5.09(e)_ shall lapse at the
earlier of (A) the sixth month anniversary of the termination or (B) the 



 

66  expiration of the Non-Compete Period, and provided further, however, that
the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) general solicitations (including by third
party recruiter contacts) or advertisements of employment (or hiring as a
result thereof) not specifically directed at such persons or (ii) solicitation
of such Employees who initiate discussions with any Parent Entity regarding
such employment with any Parent Entity without any direct or indirect
solicitation by any Parent Entity.

(f) During the Restricted Period, the Parent shall not, and shall cause the
other Parent Entities not to, without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror, directly or indirectly, on a targeted and systematic basis, solicit
for employment, employ or retain the services of any "tied agent" who
is engaged by any of the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries in
Japan, other than employment or retention for selling Non-Restricted Products.

 

(g) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this
_Section 5.09_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for
these covenants, the parties hereto would not have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that this _Section 5.09_
constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance
or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or any other
document contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of this _Section
5.09_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of
any provisions of this _Section 5.09_ shall not render unenforceable or
impair the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 5.09_. Accordingly,
if at the time of enforcement of any provision of this _Section 5.09_, a
court of competent jurisdiction holds that the restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that
the maximum period, scope or geographic area reasonable under such
circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or geographical
area and that such court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and geographical area
permitted by Law.

 

(i) The Parent expressly acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth
in this _Section 5.09_, including the geographic scope and duration of such
covenants, are necessary in order to protect and maintain the proprietary
interests and other legitimate business interests of the Acquiror and its
Affiliates, and that any violation thereof could result in irreparable injury
to the Acquiror and its Affiliates that would not be readily ascertainable or
compensable in terms of money, and therefore the Acquiror and its Affiliates
shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as damages,
which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or
remedies to which it may be entitled.

 

Section 5.10. _D andO Liabilities_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, on its own behalf and
on behalf of each of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries), irrevocably waive, release and discharge forever
each former director, statutory auditor and

 



 

67  officer of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries who resigned
effective immediately after the Closing from any and all liabilities and
obligations to, and agreements or understandings with, the Companies and
Transferred Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates) of any kind
or nature whatsoever, including in respect of rights of the Acquiror and its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to
receive contribution or indemnification from such former officers, statutory
auditors and directors, in each case whether absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, and whether arising hereunder or under any other
agreement or understanding or otherwise at Law or in equity, and the Acquiror
hereby covenants and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) that it
will not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder
from any such former director, statutory auditor or officer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Acquiror shall not, for itself or for any of its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries), waive,
release or discharge any such director, statutory auditor or officer from, or
covenant not to seek to recover any amounts for, any liabilities or
obligations, or agreements or understandings, in each case, to the extent
related to or arising from any willful misconduct by such director, auditor or
officer.

(b) After the Closing Date, the Acquiror agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) not to, amend their organizational documents or other
instruments in a manner that would affect adversely in any material respect
the rights of any individual who served as a director, statutory auditor or
officer of any Company or Transferred Subsidiary at any time prior to the
Closing Date (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") to be indemnified, either
under Japanese law or other applicable Law, as those rights existed
immediately prior to the Closing Date, against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses of investigation, defense and
ongoing monitoring) judgments, penalties, fines, losses, charges, demands,
actions, suits, proceedings, settlements, assessments, deficiencies, Taxes,
interest, obligations, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any claim, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and relating to the fact
that the DandO Indemnified Person was a director, statutory auditor or officer
of any Company or Transferred Subsidiary, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquiror
may cause any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing Date, the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to effect such amendments to its
articles of incorporation and other organizational documents or instruments as
are necessary to conform the provisions thereof in respect of director and
officer indemnification, whether in their entirety or in part, to the
Acquirors director and officer indemnification standard as attached hereto as
_Exhibit H_.

 

Section 5.11. _Mutual Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Parent, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, and its and their successors, heirs and executors (each, a "
_Parent Releasor_ "), hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily releases,
discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all claims, demands,
obligations, liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses,
setoffs, counterclaims, actions, and causes of action of whatever kind or

transaction, event, circumstance, action, failure to act, or occurrence of any
sort or type, whether known or unknown, and which occurred, existed, was taken

contained in this _Section 5.11(a)_ shall release, waive, discharge,
relinquish or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Person to the
extent related to or arising out of (i) any intercompany receivable or
payable as to which the Parent notifies the Acquiror pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section 5.07(a)_, (ii) any Intercompany Agreement set forth on
Section 5.07(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (iii) any Insurance

directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, any legal proceeding of any kind
against any Company Releasee based upon any matter released pursuant to this
_Section 5.11(a)_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) nothing
in this _Section 5.11(a)_ shall in any way limit any Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification under _ARTICLE X_ and (ii) the execution of this
Agreement shall not constitute an acknowledgment of or an admission by any
Parent Releasor or Company Releasee of the existence of any such claims or of
liability for any matter or precedent upon which any liability may be
asserted.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Acquiror, on behalf of the Companies and
the Transferred Subsidiaries, and their successors, heirs and executors
(each, an " _Acquiror Releasor_ "), hereby irrevocably, knowingly and
voluntarily releases, discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all

kind or nature, whether known or unknown, which any Acquiror Releasor has, may
have, or might have or may assert now or in the future, against the Parent,
the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and its and their respective
successors, assigns, officers, directors, partners and employees or any of
their heirs or executors (in each case in their capacity as such) (each, a "
_Parent Releasee_ "), arising out of, based upon or resulting from any
Contract, transaction, event, circumstance, action, failure to act, or
occurrence of any sort or type, whether known or unknown, and which occurred,
existed, was taken or permitted prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing contained in this _Section 5.11(b)_ shall release, waive,
discharge, relinquish or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any

in this _Section 5.11(b)_ shall in any way limit any Indemnified Partys
rights to indemnification under _ARTICLE X_ and (ii) the execution of this

Subsidiaries), hereby waives any breach or default under such Intercompany
Agreements or Insurance Agreements, and any rights to terminate, accelerate or
cancel under such Intercompany Agreements or Insurance Agreements, arising out
of or in connection with any "change of control," "change in control" or
similar phrase or concept as defined in such Intercompany Agreements or

waive any Default or Event of Default (as defined under the Syndicated Loan
Agreement) that has arisen or would be expected to arise in connection with
the execution of this Agreement and/or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, such efforts shall include an
offer by the Acquiror to execute a guarantee agreement to become effective as
of the Closing on no less favorable terms to the Acquiror than the
SMBC Guarantee, but the Acquiror shall not be obligated (A) to offer or to
execute a guarantee agreement on terms less favorable to the Acquiror than the
terms of the SMBC Guarantee or (B) to make any consent payment or other
payment to SMBC or any of its Affiliates in connection therewith.

(b) If the parties fail to obtain the consent of SMBC as set forth in 
_Section 5.13(a)_ on or before the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to Closing, (i) the

 



 

70  Parent shall promptly cause AIGFAJ to notify SMBC that 100% of the principal
amount then outstanding under the Syndicated Loan Agreement will be prepaid on
the Closing Date, (ii) the Acquiror shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, prepay and discharge the Syndicated Loan Agreement concurrently
with the Closing, and (iii) the Syndicated Loan Amount shall be increased by
the amount of any break-funding fees or other fees or expenses required to be
paid under the Syndicated Loan Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, AIGFAJ
shall not, and the Parent shall not permit AIGFAJ to, repay the principal
amount outstanding under the Syndicated Loan Agreement prior to Closing.

Section 5.14. _Parent Cash Pool_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall
cause the transfer of all of the funds of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries, including accrued and unpaid interest, out of the Parent Cash
Pool and into accounts controlled by the Companies and/or Transferred
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

Section 5.15. _Further Action_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Parent shall (i) cause
AIGFAJ to make all filings and notifications that are necessary, desirable,
advisable or appropriate to amend its articles of incorporation in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ , which amendment
provides that the preferred shares A issued by AIGFAJ will not have voting
rights and (ii) cause Edison to make all filings and notifications that are
necessary, desirable, advisable or appropriate to (A) amend its articles of
incorporation in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ , which
amendment (x) provides that the preferred shares H issued by Edison will have
voting rights (including rights to cast votes for directors of Edison), and
will be subordinated to the other preferred shares of Edison and (y) reflects
a 4:1 share split of such preferred shares H and (B) redesignate the
preferred shares G of Edison owned by the Parent as the preferred shares H and
cause a 4:1 share split of the preferred shares H. For the avoidance of doubt,
no such amendments to the Edison articles of incorporation shall apply to the
preferred shares G of Edison owned by AIGFAJ. The Parent shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the amendments
to the articles of incorporation of AIGFAJ and Edison, the redesignation and
the share split referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above to become effective
no later than thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof. The Parent
shall furnish copies of the amended articles of incorporation of AIGFAJ and
Edison, certified copies of the commercial registry and copies of the
shareholders registries of AIGFAJ and Edison, which reflect the amendments,
redesignation and share split referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) to the
Acquiror as promptly as practicable after the effective date thereof.

(b) If the amendments to the articles of incorporation of Edison referred to
in clause (ii) of _Section 5.15(a)_ above do not become effective within
thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof, the Parent shall, if
requested by the Acquiror, prepare in good faith and deliver to the Acquiror,
not later than the date that is approximately thirty (30) Business Days prior
to the expected Closing Date, a worksheet in the form attached as Section
2.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which sets forth the Parents good
faith estimate, together with explanatory notes and supporting calculations,
of the Companies Solvency Capital as of the last day of the immediately
preceding month, which estimated Companies Solvency Capital shall
be calculated in accordance with the Solvency Capital Calculation
Methodology. For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of the Companies
Solvency Capital pursuant this _Section 5.15(b)_ shall not be binding on
either party for purposes of the purchase price adjustments contemplated in
_Article II_.



 

71 (c) If the amendments to the articles of incorporation of Edison, the
redesignation and the share split referred to in clause (ii) of _Section
5.15(a)_ above do not become effective within thirty (30) Business Days after
the date hereof, during the five (5) Business Days immediately following the
Parents delivery of the calculation of the Companies Solvency Capital as
contemplated above, the Parent shall (i) permit the Acquiror and its
Representatives to review the preparers working papers and other supporting
data used in such calculation, (ii) make reasonably available the individuals
in its employ responsible for, and knowledgeable about the information used
in, the calculation of the Companies Solvency Capital in order to respond to
the reasonable inquiries of the Acquiror and (iii) otherwise cooperate in
good faith with the Acquiror and its Representatives.

(d) If the amendments to the articles of incorporation of Edison, the
redesignation and the share split referred to in clause (ii) of _Section
5.15(a)_ above do not become effective within thirty (30) Business Days after
the date hereof, no later than the date that is approximately twenty-five
(25) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, at the request of the
Acquiror:

 

(i) the Parent shall cause its Affiliates to make all filings and
notifications that are necessary, desirable, advisable or appropriate so
that, effective no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the Bridge Loan is converted into common shares of AIGFAJ. If requested by the
Acquiror, the Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Bridge Loan to be converted into common shares of
AIGFAJ as described above no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date. The Parent shall furnish a certified copy of the commercial
registry and a copy of the shareholders registry, reflecting the conversion
of the Bridge Loan to the Acquiror as promptly as practicable after the
effective date thereof; and

 

(ii) the Parent and the Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith in order to
cause a capital contribution to be made to AIGFAJ or Edison, as reasonably
determined by the parties, in exchange for additional common shares of AIGFAJ
or Edison, as applicable. In the event of a direct capital contribution to
Edison, the shares of common stock of Edison issuable in connection therewith
shall be issued to the Parent or AIRCO. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to constitute a commitment by the Parent to
make, or cause to be made, any such capital contribution. In the event
the Parent or one of its affiliates (other than any of the Companies or any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries) makes a capital contribution pursuant to this
_Section 5.15(d)(ii)_, then the Acquiror shall pay to Parent on the Closing
Date an amount equal to the amount of such contributed capital. For the
avoidance of doubt, any capital contributed pursuant to this _Section
5.15(d)(ii)_ shall be excluded from the calculation of the Companies Solvency
Capital under  _Section 2.04(b)_ and _Section 2.05_.

(e) Any new preferred shares H of Edison issued in accordance with  _Section
5.15(a)_ and any other shares of Capital Stock of AIGFAJ or Edison issued
pursuant to clauses _(i)_

  

 

72  or _(ii)_ of _Section 5.15(d)_ shall be deemed to be "Shares" for purposes
of this Agreement and shall be included in the sale and purchase contemplated
in  _Article II_ hereof (without any increase to the Purchase Price other
than the payment provided in _Section 5.15(d)(ii)_), except to the extent any
such shares of Capital Stock are owned by one of the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries. Prior to Closing, the parties shall amend Section
2.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter to reflect any changes resulting from
any change in the capitalization of AIGFAJ or Edison pursuant to _Sections
5.01(a)_ or  _(d)_. If the Bridge Loan is converted into common stock of
AIGFAJ, the Bridge Loan Purchase Price shall be reduced to $0.

 

(f) The Parent and the Acquiror (i) shall execute and deliver, or shall cause
to be executed and delivered, such documents and other papers and shall take,
or shall cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required
to carry out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and give effect to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) shall
refrain from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair,
delay or impede the Closing, and (iii) except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, including in _Section 5.05(c)_, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause all the conditions to the obligations of the
other party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be met as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

Section 5.16. _Investment Assets_.

 

(a) (i) From the date hereof through the Closing, the Parent shall deliver to
the Acquiror, on a weekly basis, a true, correct and complete list of all
purchases, acquisitions, commitments, derivatives, transactions, sales and
dispositions during the previous week of Investment Assets of any of the
Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries and all investments
and reinvestments of income and proceeds in respect thereof (such purchases,
acquisitions, commitments, derivatives, transactions, sales, dispositions,
investments and reinvestment, the " _Investment Asset Transactions_ "),
including the dates of each such Investment Asset Transaction and the book
value or amortized cost and market value of the associated Investment Asset,
(ii) no later than 30 days after the last day of each fiscal quarter prior to
the Closing, the Parent shall deliver to the Acquiror a true, correct and
complete list of the Investment Assets as of such quarter end date, and (iii)
for the five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, as
reasonably practicable, the Parent shall deliver to the Acquiror daily
updates of the Investment Asset Transactions. The Parent shall provide to the
Acquiror, on a periodic basis, the regular investment reports that are
provided to the Chief Investment Officer of any of the Companies or any of
the Transferred Subsidiaries.

(b) The Parent shall provide the Acquiror written notice of any Companys or
any Transferred Subsidiarys intention to effect an Investment Asset
Transaction the book value of which exceeds ¥3,010,000,000 per transaction or
series of related transactions, excluding (i) transactions relating to
Investment Assets belonging to one or more separate accounts of any Company
or any Transferred Subsidiary or (ii) an Investment Asset Transaction in
Japanese government bonds that does not exceed ¥5,000,000,000. The Parent
shall, and shall cause the applicable Company or Transferred Subsidiary to,
at least five Business Days prior to effecting such Investment Asset
Transaction, (i) afford the Acquiror with a reasonable opportunity to review
the principal terms and relevant financial data relating to such proposed
transaction (or series of related Investment Asset Transactions) and (ii)
consider in good faith the views and

 



 

73  comments of the Acquiror in connection with the proposed transaction (or
series of related transactions). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including  _Section 5.01_, but subject to the immediately
following sentence, the Parent shall cause the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries not to purchase or otherwise acquire any of the Investment Assets
listed on Section 5.16(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter or enter into
any derivative transactions, swaps, caps, floors, options or other risk
management arrangements with any of the counterparties listed on Section
5.16(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. For Investment Asset
Transactions prohibited by the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent
Parent or the applicable Company or Transferred Subsidiary provides written
notice (by email with receipt confirmed) to the Representative of the
Acquiror designated as an observer pursuant to _Section 5.16(c)_, including
the principal terms and relevant financial data relating to a proposed
transaction (or series of related Investment Asset Transactions), Acquiror
shall provide a written response within the time periods specified in Section
5.16(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter following receipt of such written
notice, either providing consent or withholding consent for such Investment
Asset Transaction (or series of related Investment Asset Transactions), and
failure by the Acquiror to respond in writing to such request within such
applicable time period shall be deemed consent to the Investment Asset
Transaction (or series of related Investment Asset Transactions) for purposes
of the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Acquiror shall have the right to designate a
Representative as an observer. The observer shall have the right to (i) listen
via telephone to, but not speak during, any substantive meetings of the
investment committee of any of the Companies or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any other similar body responsible for the
investment policies of any of the Companies or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries, (ii) have reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the chief investment officer (or other similar executive officer in charge of
the investment activities of any of the Companies or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and to other employees of the Companies reporting to such chief
investment or other similar officer, provided that any access to such
employees shall be subject to the prior approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and supervision of such chief investment or other similar
officer, (iii) listen via telephone to, but not speak during, any
substantive meetings at which division heads discuss material decisions
affecting the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries regarding Investment
Assets with the president, chief executive officer, or other similar executive
officer of any of the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries (other
than meetings of the board of directors of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), and (iv) in addition to the reports provided under _Section
5.16(a)_, receive reasonable access to lists of Investment Assets, Investment
Asset Transactions, information concerning executed realized gains and losses
and cash flows and other investment activity reports (including performance
and risk analysis reports) generated by the Companies in the Ordinary Course
of Business; provided that the applicable Company or Transferred Subsidiary
may withhold any information and exclude such observer from any meeting or
portion thereof if access to such information or attendance at such
meeting could adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between any of
the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries and its counsel, result
in disclosure of Trade Secrets, or result in a violation of applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
shall have sole discretion with respect to all Investment Asset Transactions,
subject to the limitations set forth on Section 5.16(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. For purposes of clarification and without prejudice to the



 

74  Acquirors rights under _Section 5.16(b)_, the observers rights under this
_Section 5.16(c)_ are limited to the right to listen, take notes and, except
with respect to the observers rights in clauses (i) and (iii) above, ask
questions. Except as set forth in _Section 5.16(b)_, the Acquirors rights
under this _Section 5.16_ shall not require the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries to wait for or to solicit any opinions of the observer or the
Acquiror on any matter, action, non-action or decision whatsoever.

 

Section 5.17. _Transitional Matters_.

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that between the date hereof and the
Closing, the Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, complete
certain actions for the operational and physical separation of the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries from the Parent and its Affiliates (other
than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) set forth in Section
5.17(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Any internal costs or expenses or
third-party out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Parent or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the separation actions contemplated in this
_Section 5.17(a)_ shall be borne by the Parent.

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.02_, promptly after the date of this
Agreement, the Parent and the Acquiror shall, and shall cause their relevant
Affiliates to, establish a team consisting of one senior manager from each of
the Insurance Companies, the Parent and the Acquiror or one of the Acquirors
Affiliates (the " _Transition Services Management Team_ "). The purpose of
such Transition Services Management Team will be to coordinate transition
activities (including the separation actions contemplated in _Section
5.17(a)_ and the migration activities contemplated in _Section 5.17(c)_)
between the date hereof and the Closing Date. The Parent and the Acquiror
shall cause such Transition Services Management Team to be subject to
confidentiality and other restrictions necessary or appropriate to ensure
compliance with all applicable Laws.

(c) (i) Following the date hereof, in furtherance of the provisions of
_Section 5.02_ and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Parent, the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Acquiror, at the Acquirors request and
direction, in planning for the provision of Services and access to Facilities
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and planning for the migration
and integration of the Business (including the data, systems, operations
and administration) and their personnel to and into the Acquiror, in
accordance with mutually acceptable timetables, guidelines and procedures
(which shall comply with applicable Law), with such cooperation to include
appointing the Transition Services Management Team and each of the Parent,
the Sellers and the service providers under the Transition Services Agreement
(collectively), the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries (collectively)
and the Acquiror: (A) establishing divestiture planning committees as
mutually agreed; (B) setting regular meetings of the Transition Services
Management Team and the divestiture planning committees; (C) making available
appropriate knowledgeable business, operations, administration and technology
personnel and any other personnel reasonably needed for the planning for the
provision of Services and access to Facilities pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement and the planning for the migration and integration of
the Business; (D) developing detailed project plans and budgets for the
provision of Services and access to Facilities pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement and the migration and integration of the Business; and (E)
dedicating commercially reasonable resources



 

75  to accomplish the foregoing. With respect to the members of the Transition
Services Management Team appointed by the Parent and the Insurance Companies,
such members shall be Persons with sufficient knowledge and authority, inside
and outside Japan, to ensure that the appropriate personnel from the Parent,
the Sellers, the service providers under the Transition Services Agreement,
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, respectively, are assigned to
the appropriate divestiture planning committees to be involved in the
foregoing. All planning and cooperation contemplated by this _Section
5.17(c)_ shall be conducted in compliance with applicable Law (including
antitrust and competition Law) and with the intention to minimize disruption
to the Business and the businesses of the Parent, the Sellers, the Acquiror
and their respective Affiliates.

 

(ii) During the period commencing on the date hereof and extending until the
Closing Date, the Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Acquiror, at the
Acquirors request and direction, to (A) perform any migration services
reasonably required in order to migrate such services or access to facilities
as were provided by or on behalf of the Parent or any of its Affiliates to any
of the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries prior to the Closing,
but that are not contemplated to be so provided under the Transition
Services Agreement from and after the Closing, and (B) perform any other
migration services as are mutually agreed to by the Parent and the Acquiror.
The applicable party shall provide, or cause to be provided, such migration
services as if they were Migration Services pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, as if such agreement were in effect as of the date hereof.

 

(iii) Each of the Parent and the Acquiror shall bear its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the planning and cooperation
contemplated by this _Section 5.17(c)_, provided that the Acquiror shall
reimburse the Parent for any reasonable, necessary and adequately documented
third-party out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Parent or any of
its affiliates to an unaffiliated Person in connection with the planning or
cooperation contemplated by this Section 5.17(c) to the extent such expenses
are incurred by the Parent or its Affiliates with the prior written approval
of the Acquiror. 

(iv) (A) Prior to the Closing, the Parent shall, reasonably and in good faith,
propose to Acquiror an allocation of the existing Service Charges among the
Service Names set forth under the "Information Technology Infrastructure" and
"Information Service" Services provided by AIGKK, as set forth on Schedule
2.01 to the Transition Services Agreement (collectively, the " _Sub-
characterized Services_ "). Absent objection from Acquiror, each Sub-
characterized Service shall be a separate Service under the Transition
Services Agreement and Schedule 2.01 shall be amended accordingly. (B) If the
Parent fails to submit such a proposal to the Acquiror prior to Closing, the
Acquiror may, reasonably and in good faith, propose to the Parent an
allocation of such Sub-characterized Service and the monthly services charges
related thereto, for each Sub-characterized Service, and the Parent shall not
unreasonably reject such proposal unless it is not reasonable in relation to
the Fully Burdened Costs of the Provider of such Service (as those terms
are defined in the Transition Services Agreement), provided that, in the case
of any such rejection, the Parent and the Acquiror shall in good faith agree
on a proposal that is reasonable in relation to such Fully 



 

76  Burdened Costs. In each case of a proposal presented pursuant to clauses (A)
or (B), the Sub-characterized Service, and the allocated Service Charge
associated therewith, shall be reasonable in relation to (i) the nature of
such Sub-characterized Service and (ii) in the case of (A), the actual Fully
Burdened Costs of each Provider associated with its provision and, in the case
of (B), the definition of Fully Burdened Costs in the Transition Services
Agreement. In no event shall a proposal presented pursuant to clauses (A) or
(B) propose an aggregate amount of monthly service charges for the aggregate
of the Sub-characterized Services more than, or less than, the amount of
aggregate monthly Service Charges set forth in Schedule 2.01 to the Transition
Services Agreement with respect to such Sub-characterized Services.

 

(d) During the period commencing on the date hereof and extending until the
Closing Date, the Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the space identified in
Section 5.17(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Dedicated Space_ ") to
be assigned to, or a new lease or sublease with respect to such Dedicated
Space to be entered into with, one of the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries, subject to any applicable regulatory requirements and any
consents that are necessary for purposes of such assignment. If, prior to the
Closing, such Dedicated Space is assigned to one of the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries, or an Affiliate of the Acquiror, or if one of the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries or such Affiliate enters into a new
lease or sublease in relation to such Dedicated Space, to the extent that the
service charges under the Transition Services Agreement include any costs
attributable to the lease or sublease of such Dedicated Space, such service
charges shall be reduced accordingly.

 

(e) Prior to Closing, the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause AIGFAJ, Edison, Edison Service and AIRCO to enter into an amendment to
the agreement identified in Section 5.17(e)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, which amendment shall be in substantially the form set forth in
Section 5.17(e)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

(f) During October 2010, the Parent and the Acquiror will cooperate in
reconciling any potential discrepancies in Schedule 2.01 to the Transition
Services Agreement, with respect to services provided by American
International Group K.K. to each of Edison and Star, as such services relate
to any assets and leases having an annual expenditure in excess of $5,000. If
there are errors or omissions with regard to such assets or leases that, in
the aggregate, exceed $50,000, the Parent and the Acquiror shall, in good
faith, make appropriate corresponding changes to the Services Charges (as that
term is used in the Transition Services Agreement) for such services.

(g) By no later than forty-five (45) days after the date hereof, the
Acquiror shall notify the Parent whether it does not need any transition
service for which the Initial Scheduled Term (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement) is three (3) months. If the Acquiror provides such notice,
such service shall be deleted from Schedule 2.01 of the Transition Services
Agreement and the Parent need not provide to the Acquiror Entities (as defined
in the Transition Services Agreement) such service under the Transition
Services Agreement.

 



 

77 Section 5.18. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Parent, on the one hand,
and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of: (i)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to
result in the failure of any condition to the Closing or that indicates that
any of the representations and warranties contained in the
Transaction Agreements will not be, or are not, true and correct and (ii) the
receipt of any material notice or other communication from any third Person
alleging that the approval, consent, authorization, permission or act of, or
the making by the Parent, the Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates,
as the case may be, of any notices to or declaration, filing or registration
with, such third Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that such transactions
otherwise may violate the rights of or confer remedies upon such third Person;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, such disclosure shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or any failure of a condition to the Closing, or to otherwise
limit or affect in any way the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice; and _provided_ , _further_ , that failure to deliver
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.18(a)_ shall not result in a failure
of any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ or liability to any party hereto
under _ARTICLE X_ unless the underlying event or breach would independently
result in the failure of such condition or such liability.

(b) Each of the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other
hand, shall promptly notify the other of any Action that shall be instituted
or threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge
the legality of any transaction contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.
Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other of any Action that may be
threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Parent, the Acquiror or
any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, that would have been
listed on Section 3.08 of the Seller Disclosure Letter or Section 4.04 of the
Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, if such Action had arisen
prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, such
disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or to satisfy any condition or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that failure to deliver any notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.18(b)_ shall not result in a failure of any condition set
forth in _Article VIII_.

Parent shall provide, and shall cause the Sellers, the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to
provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any

financings (collectively, the " _Financings_ ") or in connection with
satisfying any reporting obligation under the Exchange Act, in each case as
may be reasonably requested by the Acquiror, including:

(a) providing to the Acquiror information (which the Acquiror may provide

Persons providing or arranging the Financings and identifying any portion of

78 (b) assisting the Acquiror and its financing sources in the preparation of (i)
one or more offering documents and/or confidential information memoranda for
any Financing, including by (A) preparing and delivering to the Acquiror any
audited or unaudited financial statements of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries requested by the Acquiror, and (B) cooperating in the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements, in each case of (A) and (B)
to the extent the Acquiror reasonably determines that such financial

thereof) and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (treating each Financing
as an offering registered under the Securities Act), and (ii) materials for
rating agency presentations; 

(c) assisting the Acquiror in the preparation of any audited or unaudited
financial statements of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries to the
extent the Acquiror reasonably determines that such financial statements will
be required in connection with its post-Closing reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act;

 

(d) causing the appropriate members of management to participate , at the
Acquirors expense, in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road

The Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to periodically update any

Rule 3-05(b)(4) thereof) and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (treating
each Financing as an offering registered under the Securities Act) and the
other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC provided in connection with
the consummation of any Financing or in connection with any other financing
obligation or reporting obligation under the Exchange Act. Subject to prior
consultation with the Acquiror, any reasonable, and adequately documented,
third party costs incurred by the Parent or its Affiliates in connection with
the Parents obligations under this  _Section 5.19_ shall be reimbursed by
the Acquiror as directed by the Parent.

79  Pledge Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as may be amended,
modified or supplemented from time to time), between the Parent and the FRBNY,
(ii) the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as may be amended,

Section 5.21. _Troubled Asset Relief Program_. The Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to release the Companies and the Target Subsidiaries
from any obligations under any contracts with the U.S. Treasury, the FRBNY or
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board arising from the
affiliation of the Companies and the Target Subsidiaries with the Parent in
the event that such companies have any obligations or remain subject to any
limitations following the Closing.

ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 6.01. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 6.01_, as of the
Closing Date, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall terminate
their participation in each Benefit Plan that is not a Company Benefit Plan,
and in no event shall any Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under
such Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered or compensation paid on
or after the Closing Date. The Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
shall retain all rights, liabilities and obligations under, and neither the
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation
under, each Company Benefit Plan on and after the Closing Date.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent and the Acquiror shall agree
whether, and to what extent, (i) the employment of any employee of the Parent
or any of its Affiliates whose duties relate primarily to the Business (other
than an Employee who is on (A) long-term disability or other unpaid
medical leave or (B) leave due to a workplace injury covered by a workers
compensation policy or program incurred more than six months prior to the
Closing date; unless the failure to transfer any such employee violates
applicable Law, as determined by the Parent in good faith and in consultation
with the Acquiror) and who at such time is not already employed by a Company
or Transferred Subsidiary shall be transferred to a Company or Transferred
Subsidiary (each, a " _Transferred Employee_ ") with such transfer occurring
on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and
(ii) the employment of each employee of a Company or Transferred Subsidiary
whose duties do not relate primarily to the Business shall cease or otherwise
be transferred to the Parent or an Affiliate other than the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries (each, a " _Returned Employee_ "). The employees
whom, as of the date hereof, the Parent and the Acquiror have agreed will be
Transferred Employees or Returned Employees are so identified in Section
6.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, under the heading "Transferred
Employees." The employees whom, as of the date hereof, the Parent and the
Acquiror reasonably expect to be Returned Employees are so identified in
Section 6.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter under the heading "Returned
Employees." The Parent and the Acquiror agree that the list of "Returned
Employees" contained in Section 6.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall
be subject to update and amendment by the Parties during

 



 

80  the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date; provided that such
list shall be final and not subject to change as of the Closing Date. For a
period of at least 12 months after the Closing Date, and subject to
applicable Law, the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to take all action necessary
to provide that during each Employees period of employment with the Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), (i) such Employee shall receive base salary at a rate not less
than such Employees base salary in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) such Employee shall be eligible for total incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the total
incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Employee by the Parent
and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
immediately prior to the Closing Date. All other terms and conditions of
employment and of employee benefits shall be determined in accordance with
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for a period of 12
months after the Closing Date, (i) all Employees (other than Transferred
Employees) shall be provided with employee benefits that are substantially no
less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to such
Employee by the Parent and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) all Transferred Employees shall be provided with employee
benefits that are substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than those
generally made available to Acquirors similarly situated employees in the
jurisdiction. Nothing in this _Section 6.01_ shall limit in any way the right
of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any Employee at any time, to change or modify the terms of any Benefit Plan
at any time and in any manner, or to change or to change or modify the terms
or conditions of employment of any Employee, subject in any such case to the
express terms of any applicable Benefit Plan and applicable Law.

(c) For purposes of determining eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting (but
not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan
or benefit accruals that would result in duplication of benefits) under all
benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by the Acquiror or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to, give
each Employee, credit for such Employees service with the Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to the
same extent recognized by the Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) under the Benefits Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date; notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 6.01(c)_ shall not apply to any equity based benefit plans, programs
or arrangements.

 

(d) The Acquiror shall cause the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries to
recognize and provide all accrued but unused vacation and sick pay of the
Employees as of the Closing Date.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall assume any and
all obligation for and shall pay, or cause the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to assume any and all obligation for and pay, any retention
bonuses, any cash incentive payments and any annual incentive bonuses, whether
the obligation therefor arises before, after or as a result of the Closing,
payable to any Employee pursuant to the terms of any Company Benefit Plans
that are bonus plans or arrangements in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date and applicable to 



 

81  such Employees (in each case to the extent not paid by the Parent (or any of
its Affiliates), the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing). In furtherance of the foregoing, Acquiror shall pay, or shall cause
the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries to pay, an aggregate amount in
bonuses in respect of the foregoing plans and arrangements that is no less
than the amount accrued therefor (as adjusted through the Closing Date). From
and after the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates
(other than the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain any
responsibility for such payment obligations, regardless of when such
amounts were earned or accrued. For the avoidance of doubt, the liability for
the ECAP Severance and Completion Plans of the Companies shall be accrued on
the balance sheet included in the Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital
Worksheet of the Insurance Companies at Closing, and, the obligation of the
Acquiror with respect thereto shall be limited to such accrued amount
(including any liability arising from any amendments to the ECAP Severance and
Completion Plans between the date hereof and Closing).

(f) With respect to the Employees, after the Closing Date, the Acquiror, the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have the liability and
obligation for, in respect to any Company Benefit Plans, and neither the
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for:
(i) any short-term disability, sick pay or salary continuation benefits; or
(ii) any medical, dental, life insurance, long-term disability or other
welfare benefit claims. Any preexisting condition clause in any of the welfare
plans (including medical, dental and disability coverage) included in the
Acquirors benefit programs shall be waived for the Employees. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.01(f)_, the Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
shall retain all the liabilities and obligations referenced in this _Section
6.01(f)_ to the extent arising prior to the Closing Date under Benefit Plans
that are not Company Benefit Plans.

 

(g) The Acquiror, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall, and
hereby do, assume all liability and obligation for, and neither the Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall retain any liability or obligation for, (i)
severance pay and obligations payable to any former employee of any of the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries who, as of the Closing Date,
is receiving or due to receive severance payments and benefits from the
Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing Date and (ii) severance pay and
obligations payable to any Employee who is terminated by the Acquiror, the
Companies or any Transferred Subsidiary on or after the Closing Date. With
respect to any Employee whose employment is terminated by the Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates during the 6 month period immediately following the Closing
Date, the Acquiror shall provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide,
severance benefits to such Employee, which shall be determined and payable in
accordance with the severance benefit plan or agreement maintained by
the Parent, the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates for the benefit of such Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(h) The Parent and the Acquiror shall, or shall ensure that their Affiliates
shall, comply with their respective consultation and other obligations
arising out of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
respect to the Employees (including those individuals who will become
Employees on or prior to the Closing Date) of any of the Companies, any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries, or their respective union or elected
representatives, or other employee representative body, as required by Law,
collective bargaining

 



 

82  agreements or any other applicable regulations and shall cooperate in
connection therewith, with such cooperation to include, if applicable,
obtaining from all Employees, directors, independent contractors, agents and
brokers of the Companies and Transferred Subsidiaries express written consents
to the cross border transfer of their personal data to the Acquiror following
the signing of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto will use good faith
efforts to comply with their obligations under this _Section 6.01(h)_ as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

(i) The Parent or its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing workers
compensation or similar workers protection benefits with respect to any
Employee prior to the Closing Date. The Acquiror, the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall be responsible for providing any workers
compensation or similar workers protection benefits to any Employee on or
after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , the Parent or its Affiliates
(other than the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain the
obligation and liability for any workers compensation or similar workers
protection claims of any Employee or former employee that arose, or relate to,
an incident that occurred and with respect to which a claim was filed on or
prior to the Closing Date (unless such obligations were accrued as
liabilities of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date). Any workers compensation insurance arrangements maintained by
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall inure to the benefit of
the Acquiror. For purposes of this _Section 6.01(i)_, a workers
compensation or similar workers protection claim shall be deemed to have been
incurred upon the injury or condition giving rise to the benefits thereunder.

 

(j) The provisions of this _Section 6.01_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto, and no current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of the Agreement, whether in respect of continued employment or
service, or resumed employment or service, compensation,
benefits, incentives, or otherwise. Nothing herein, whether express or
implied, shall be construed as a modification of or amendment to any Benefit
Plan for any purpose.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this _ARTICLE VI_ , with respect to any
expatriate Employee of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries who is a
citizen or resident alien of the United States principally employed or
rendering substantial services in Japan (each, a " _U.S. Expatriate Employee_
"), none of the rules regarding compensation programs or benefits set forth
in _Section 6.01(b)_ through _Section 6.01(i)_ of this _ARTICLE VI_ shall
apply. Following the Closing Date, each U.S. Expatriate Employee shall be
provided with compensation programs and employee benefits that
are substantially similar in all respects (including with respect to terms
and conditions of the applicable governing plans, programs and policies) to
the compensation programs and employee benefits that are made available by the
Acquiror to other similarly situated citizens or resident aliens of the
United States principally employed by or rendering substantial services for
the Acquiror in Japan. For a period of at least 12 months after the Closing
Date, and subject to applicable Law, the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to take
all action necessary to provide that during each U.S. Expatriate Employees
period of employment with the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries), (i) such U.S. Expatriate
Employee shall receive base salary at a rate not less than such U.S.
Expatriate Employees base salary in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) such U.S. Expatriate Employee shall be eligible for total
incentive compensation opportunities that are

 



 

83  no less favorable in the aggregate than the total incentive compensation
opportunities provided to such U.S. Expatriate Employee by the Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
immediately prior to the Closing Date. All other terms and conditions of
employment and of employee benefits shall be determined in accordance with
applicable Law but otherwise in accordance with the principles of this 
_Section 6.01(k)_. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, (i) for a period of
12 months after the Closing Date, each U.S. Expatriate Employee shall be
provided with employee benefits that are substantially no less favorable in
the aggregate than those generally made available to Acquirors similarly
situated employees in the jurisdiction and (ii) in the event that the
employment of a U.S. Expatriate Employee is terminated by the Acquiror within
6 months after the Closing Date, such U.S. Expatriate Employee shall be
provided with severance benefits that are substantially no less favorable in
the aggregate than those severance benefits generally made available to
Acquirors similarly situated employees in the jurisdiction (after giving
effect to such U.S. Expatriate Employees years of service with the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries for purposes of severance benefit
calculations); provided, however, that, if the U.S. Expatriate Employee is
eligible for Stars Employee Continuity Assurance Plan and is terminated by
the Acquiror within 12 months of the Closing Date, Acquiror (or, as
applicable, the Companies or one of the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall
provide such U.S. Expatriate Employee the severance benefits determined in
accordance with the terms of the individual agreement entered into by such
U.S. Expatriate Employee pursuant to such plan and none of Acquiror, the
Companies nor the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have any other obligation to
provide severance or other termination benefits to such U.S. Expatriate
Employee.

In applying the provisions of this Article to any Employee, the Acquiror, the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not take into account any
Compensation Restrictions, if so permitted under applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.01. _Liability for Taxes_.

 

(a) The Parent shall be liable for and pay, or shall cause the applicable
Seller to pay, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties (as defined in _Section 10.02(a)_) from and against, all
Taxes and Losses imposed on or incurred by any Acquiror Indemnified Party, or
for which any Acquiror Indemnified Party may otherwise be liable, relating to
(i) any Taxes imposed upon any Company or any Transferred Subsidiary with
respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period and, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date, (ii) any Taxes imposed upon any Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary or any Successor Entity with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable
Period or, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending after the Closing Date, that would not be payable by, or
imposed upon, such Company or such Transferred Subsidiary or such Successor
Entity if any amount of net operating losses or credits generated during the
Parent or its Affiliates period of ownership of the applicable Company or
Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing Date had not been decreased as a
result of any Tax audits or proceedings by any Tax Authority, except to the
extent any such 



 

84  decrease in net operating losses or credits (A) is expected to give rise to
a Tax benefit to any Company or any Transferred Subsidiary or any Successor
Entity in a Post-Closing Taxable Period or, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date, (B)
is caused by an action taken by or transaction entered into by the Acquiror or
its Affiliates other than those contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any reorganization or other transfer
of the interests or assets of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries by
the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates following the Closing) or (C) is a
result of the carryback of any item from a Post-Closing Taxable Period or with
respect to the portion of any Straddle Period relating to after the Closing
Date, (iii) any breach or inaccuracy in any representation contained in 
_Section 3.20_ or (iv) any breach or failure by the Parent to perform (or
cause to be performed) any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
_Article VII_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall not be liable
for or pay, and shall not indemnify the Acquiror Indemnified Parties from and
against (A) any Taxes shown as an accrued tax payable on the Final Actual
Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet, and (B) any Taxes imposed on any
Company or Transferred Subsidiary, or for which any Company or Transferred
Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, as a result of transactions occurring or
deemed to occur on the Closing Date but after the Closing (other than those
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any reorganization or other transfer of the interests or assets of the
Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries by the Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates following the Closing) or occurring in the Ordinary Course of
Business) (Taxes described in clauses (A) and (B) above, hereinafter "
_Excluded Taxes_ ").

 

(b) The Acquiror shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against, (i) all
liabilities for Taxes imposed on any Company or Transferred Subsidiary, or for
which any Company or Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, for any
Post-Closing Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, (ii)
Excluded Taxes and (iii) any breach or failure by the Acquiror to perform (or
cause to be performed) any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
_Article VII_.

(c) For purposes of clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 7.01_, whenever it
is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes of any Company or Transferred Subsidiary for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods,
one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of such Company or Transferred Subsidiary for
the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of such
Company or Transferred Subsidiary were closed at the close of the Closing
Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that Taxes imposed on a periodic basis ( _e_.
_g_., property taxes), and exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

 

(d) (i) To the extent any indemnity pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)(i)_,
_Section 7.01(a)(iii)_ or  _Section 7.01(a)(iv)_ is includible in income,
the Parent shall increase such indemnity payment to the applicable Acquiror
Indemnified Party to compensate for the Japanese

 



 

85  Tax detriment resulting from such inclusion (the aggregate of such indemnity
payment and such increase, a " _Tax Indemnity Payment_ "); provided, however,
that Parent and Acquiror shall cooperate to direct payment to the Parent or a
Seller on one hand, and the Acquiror or a Designated Acquiror on the other
hand, as the case may be, if doing so would result in the Tax Indemnity
Payments being treated as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price.

(ii) To the extent the adjustment that gave rise to a Tax Indemnity Payment
results in a Tax benefit for Japanese Tax purposes to any of the Companies,
the Transferred Subsidiaries or any Successor Entity that is actually realized
by any of them prior to the end of the close of the taxable year in which the
fourth anniversary of such Tax Indemnity Payment occurs, the Acquiror or any
Designated Acquiror shall remit to the Parent such Tax benefit (determined on
a with and without basis) (a " _Tax Benefit Payment_ "); provided that in no
event shall the cumulative Tax benefit remitted by the Acquiror or any
Designated Acquiror to the Parent exceed the amount of the applicable Tax
Indemnity Payment. If any such Tax benefit is subsequently disallowed prior to
the end of the close of the taxable year in which the fourth anniversary of
such Tax Benefit Payment occurs, the Parent shall make an appropriate
reconciliation payment to the Acquiror.

 

(iii) In the event there has been a Tax Indemnity Payment, the Acquiror shall
provide on an annual basis a certification by a responsible tax officer of
the Acquiror with the knowledge of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries of the amount (if any) of any increase to a tax indemnity payment
pursuant to Section _7.01(d)(i)_ and the amount (if any) of the Tax benefit
to be remitted to Parent pursuant to Section _7.01(d)(ii)_.

Section 7.02. _Tax Returns_.

(a) The Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Taxable Periods that are due on or before the
Closing Date, and in each case the Parent shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, and the Acquiror shall timely
file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to each Company and Transferred Subsidiary and the Acquiror shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
With respect to Tax Returns to be filed or caused to be filed by the Parent or
the Acquiror pursuant to the preceding sentence that relate to Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods or Straddle Periods (x) to the extent permitted by Law, such
Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with the last previous Tax
Return relating to the same Taxes filed as of the date hereof, except to the
extent failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to result, directly
or indirectly, in a material cost to the other party and (y) such Tax Returns
shall be submitted to the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, not
later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if
such due date is within 30 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date) for review and approval by the Parent
or the Acquiror, as the case may be, which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld. The Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall pay the other
or cause to be paid to the other the Taxes for 



 

86  which the Parent or the Acquiror, respectively, is liable pursuant to
_Section 7.01_ but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed or
caused to be filed by the Parent, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other
hand, pursuant to this _Section 7.02(a)_ upon the written request of the
Party entitled to payment, setting forth in reasonable detail the computation
of the amount owed by the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the
other hand, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than 10 days prior to
the due date for paying such Taxes.

 

(b) Except in accordance with _Section 7.03_, none of the Parent, the
Acquiror or any Affiliate of either shall (or shall cause or permit any
Company or Transferred Subsidiary to) amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to any Company or Transferred Subsidiary
with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods (or with respect to any
Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of the Parent or the
Acquiror, as the case may be, except to the extent such amendment, refiling,
modification or grant is required by Law or would not reasonably be expected
to result, directly or indirectly, in a material cost to the other party.

(c) In order to assist the Parent and its Affiliates in filing their Tax
Returns, the Parent will deliver to the Acquiror a questionnaire in a form
substantially similar to the form set forth on Section 7.02(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, and consistent with past practice, the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries will use their reasonable efforts promptly to
complete such questionnaire (which for the avoidance of doubt will not include
any information relating to periods after the Closing Date or any information
related to the Section 338 elections described in _Section 7.06(b)_).

(d) The Parent hereby agrees and covenants to furnish to the Acquiror, prior
to Closing, complete and accurate copies of all Internal Revenue Service Forms
5471, 8621, 8865 and 8858 filed within the last three years in respect of the
Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries and any investments held by any of
such entities, which Forms have not been otherwise previously furnished.

 

Section 7.03. _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, the Acquiror (or a Designated Acquiror) and the
Parent shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt by any
Acquiror Indemnified Party or Parent Indemnified Party, as the case may be, of
written notice of any pending or threatened tax audits, examinations or
assessments (a " _Tax Claim_ ") which would reasonably be expected to affect
the Tax liabilities for which the Parent or the Acquiror may be liable under
_Section 7.01_; _provided_ , that the failure by the Acquiror or the Parent,
as the case may be, to notify the other of any Tax Claim shall not
relieve the Parent or the Acquiror (or a Designated Acquiror), as the case
may be, of its obligations under this _Article VII_ in whole or in part except
to the extent the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, is materially
prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.

(b)

 

(i) The Parent shall have the right to control the contest of any Tax Claim
for which the Parent is solely liable under this Agreement; _provided_ , that
(A) the



 

87  Acquiror shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in (but
not control) all proceedings related to such Tax Claim, (B) the Parent shall
promptly furnish to the Acquiror copies of all relevant correspondence and
documentation in connection with any such Tax Claim and shall provide the
Acquiror with the opportunity to comment on all proposed correspondence and
submissions to the relevant tax authority, which comments the Parent shall
consider in good faith, (C) the Parent shall consult in good faith with the
Acquiror regarding the conduct of the contest of any such Tax Claim and (D)
the Parent shall use good faith reasonable efforts to take positions in any
contest that are consistent with the positions taken in prior settlements with
respect to substantially similar issues if the failure to take a consistent
position would give rise to a material adverse effect to any of the Companies
or the Transferred Subsidiaries. The Parent shall not, and shall not permit
any relevant party to, enter into any settlement or otherwise compromise any
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Acquiror, _provided_ ,
that if the Acquiror shall refuse to consent to any settlement or compromise
that the relevant tax authorities and the Parent propose to accept (a "
_Proposed Settlement_ ") and such Proposed Settlement would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material Tax cost to the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
that is not indemnified by the Parent, then (X) the liability of the Parent
with respect to the subject matter of the Proposed Settlement shall be limited
to the amount that such liability would have been to the Parent were the
Proposed Settlement accepted, and (Y) the Acquiror shall thereafter be
entitled to assume control of the contest, settlement and compromise of such
Tax Claim and shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with such
Tax Claim.

(ii) With respect to any Straddle Period, the Parent and the Acquiror
shall jointly control the contest, settlement and compromise of any relevant
Tax Claim and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own
expense and no settlement or compromise with respect thereto shall be entered
into without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(iii) Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Acquiror of a Tax Claim
pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_, the Parent shall notify the Acquiror in
writing if its intention to control the contest of any Tax Claim that is the
subject of such notice and that the Parent is otherwise entitled to control
(or jointly control) pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)(i)_ or _Section
7.03(b)(ii)_. If the Acquiror does not receive such notice from the Parent
within such period, or if the Parent shall notify the Acquiror that it does
not wish to control (or jointly control) the contest of such Tax Claim (or any
other Tax Claim), the Acquiror thereupon shall be entitled to control the
contest, settlement and compromise of such Tax Claim in its sole discretion; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Parent to provide notice
shall not result in the Parent waiving any of its rights under this Agreement
(including its right to control the contest of the Tax Claim) in whole or in
part except to the extent the Acquiror is materially prejudiced as a
consequence of such failure.

(iv) Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing contained in this
_Section 7.03(b) _shall be construed as limiting the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties right to indemnification under _Section 7.01_, _provided_ , that the
Acquiror may elect (by written notice to the Parent) to forgo indemnification
under _Section 7.01_ for a Tax Claim or



 

88  portion thereof, in which case the Acquiror shall be entitled to control the
contest, settlement and compromise of such Tax Claim or applicable portion

refund or credit of Taxes of any such entity (net of any Tax cost arising out

extent such refunds relate to Excluded Taxes or result from the carryback of
any item from a Post-Closing Taxable Period. Each Company and any Transferred
Subsidiary shall be entitled to retain all other refunds or credits with
respect to Taxes of such entities. The Person that is to enjoy the economic

avoidance of doubt, the request under _Section 7.02(c)_) that, in the
reasonable judgment of the party receiving the request, requires the
engagement of third party consultants to fulfill, the requesting party shall
engage such consultants (provided they are reasonably acceptable to the other
party) and shall be solely responsible for the remuneration of such
consultants.

 

Section 7.06. _Other Tax Matters_.

Acquiror shall send a notice, or cause a notice to be sent, to the Parent or
its Affiliates as required pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations

Sharing Agreements binding on any Company or Transferred Subsidiary shall be
terminated on or before the Closing Date such that no Company or Transferred
Subsidiary shall have any obligation thereunder after the Closing.

TERMINATION AND WAIVER

 

Section 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Parent and the Acquiror;

 

(b) by either the Parent or the Acquiror if the Closing has not occurred on or
before April 1, 2011; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the sole reason that
the Closing has not occurred is either (i) that one or more of the approvals
required pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ have not been obtained on or prior to
such date or (ii) that the Parent requires additional time to prepare and
deliver any financial statements requested by the Acquiror to be delivered by
the Parent to the Acquiror pursuant to _Section 5.19(b)_, such date may be
extended by either party to a date not beyond October 1, 2011; and _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party hereto whose failure to take any
action required to fulfill any of such partys obligations under this
Agreement or other breach of any provision of this Agreement has caused or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date;

 

(c) by either the Parent or the Acquiror in the event of the issuance of a
final, non-appealable Governmental Order restraining or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;

(d) by the Acquiror (but only so long as the Acquiror is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Parent
such that one or more of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections
8.01_ and _8.03_ are not capable of being fulfilled as of April 1, 2011
(subject to extension pursuant to the first proviso in _Section 9.01(b)_); or

 

(e) by the Parent (but only so long as the Parent is not in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement) if there has been a material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Acquiror such that
one or more of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 8.01_ and
_8.02_ are not capable of being fulfilled as of April 1, 2011 (subject to
extension pursuant to the first proviso in _Section 9.01(b)_).

Section 9.02. _Notice of Termination_. Any party hereto desiring to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ shall give written notice
of such termination to the other party or parties, as the case may be, to this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.03. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in  _Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party
to this Agreement (or any of its Affiliates or Representatives), except that
_Section 5.04(a)_, this  _Article IX_, and _Article XI_ shall survive any
such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
9.03_ shall relieve any party from liability for an intentional breach of this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated after



 

93  April 1, 2011 pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_, _Section 9.01(c)_ or _Section
9.01(e)_ as a result of a failure by the Acquiror to obtain any approval from
the FSA necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Acquiror shall be obligated to pay to the Parent in cash interest on the
Purchase Price, at a rate of 5% per annum, for the period commencing on April
1, 2011 and ending on the date the Parent terminates this agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.01(b)_, _Section 9.01(c)_ or _Section 9.01(e)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.03_, neither the
Acquiror nor any Designated Acquiror shall be required to pay such Purchase
Price Interest Amount if the failure of the Parent or the Sellers to fulfill
any obligations under this Agreement was the sole and direct cause of, or
solely and directly resulted in, the failure of Closing to occur prior to
April 1, 2011, provided, further that in the event the Acquiror has incurred
the obligation to pay the Purchase Price Interest Amount, the Acquiror shall
not be obligated to pay any interest for any period during which the failure
of the Parent or the Sellers to fulfill any such obligation was the sole and
direct cause of, or solely and directly resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur.

relating to or in connection with:

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Parent in this Agreement or the certificates required to be delivered pursuant

(i) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising from
substantially the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such
claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of
¥5,000,000 (nor shall any such claim or series of related claims that do not
meet the ¥5,000,000 threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties Losses
for which the Parent has responsibility under clause (ii) of this _Section
10.02(b)_ below); and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Capped Losses for
which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification exceeds

reimburse the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for the aggregate amount of all
Capped Losses for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ that are in excess of

related claims arising from substantially the same underlying facts, events
or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of ¥5,000,000 (nor shall any such
claim or series of related claims that do not meet the ¥5,000,000 threshold be
applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of
the Parent Indemnified Parties Losses for which the Acquiror has
responsibility under clause (ii) of this _Section 10.03(b)_ below); (ii)

Section 10.04. _Notification of Claims_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this _ARTICLE X_
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties
liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
any claim in respect of which

 



 

96  indemnity may be sought under this _ARTICLE X_ , including any pending or
threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this _ARTICLE X_ (including a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party
whether by litigation, arbitration or otherwise) (each, a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this _ARTICLE X_ except to the extent
that such failure materially prejudices the defense of such claim by the
Indemnifying Party. Any indemnifiable claim that is not a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by written notice to the Indemnifying Party. The
parties agree that (i) in this _ARTICLE X_ they intend to shorten (in the case
of the limited survival periods specified in _Section 10.01_) and lengthen
(in the case of the indefinite survival periods specified in _Section
10.01_) (as the case may be) the applicable statute of limitations period with
respect to certain claims; (ii) notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation or warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in _Section 10.01_ for such
representation or warranty; and (iii) any claims for indemnification under
this _ARTICLE X_ for which notice is not timely delivered in accordance with
this _Section 10.04(a)_ shall be expressly barred and are hereby waived;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if, prior to such applicable date, a party
hereto shall have notified the other party hereto in accordance with the
requirements of this _Section 10.04(a)_ of a claim for indemnification under
this _ARTICLE X_ (whether or not formal legal action shall have been commenced
based upon such claim), such claim shall continue to be subject to
indemnification in accordance with this _ARTICLE X_ notwithstanding the
passing of such applicable date until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 10.04(a)_ in respect of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within 20
Business Days after the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, elect to
compromise, settle, defend or appeal such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel, contractors and consultants (who shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party) and at its own expense, and the Indemnified Party
shall, and the Parent, on the one hand, or the Acquiror, on the other hand (as
the case may be), shall cause each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in the
compromise, settlement or appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party
Claim; provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the compromise,
defense, appeal or settlement of such Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party (such as reasonable travel
costs, but not internal time charges) in providing its cooperation, (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to employ one counsel to represent itself
if an actual conflict of interest exists in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, and in that event the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel shall promptly be paid by the Indemnifying
Party (it being understood that all Indemnified Parties may employ not more
than one counsel to represent them at the expense of the Indemnifying Party)
and (iii) with respect to any Third Party Claim that is asserted, initiated or
brought by a Governmental Authority or involves or alleges any violations of
Laws, the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to participate in any meeting
with any

 



 

97  Governmental Authority relating to any such Third Party Claim unless it
consults with the Indemnified Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority or otherwise practicable, gives the Indemnified
Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The
Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such
Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from
the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.
In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the compromise,
settlement or appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim within 20
Business Days after receipt of notice thereof from the Indemnified Party,
such Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the compromise,
settlement or appeal of, or defense against such Third Party Claim on behalf
of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably apprised of any significant developments relating to such Third
Party Claim and the compromise, settlement, appeal or defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the compromise, settlement or appeal of,
or defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless
such settlement, compromise, or discharge or entry or any judgment does not
involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing or liability by the Indemnified Party and such settlement,
compromise, discharge or judgment involves only the payment of money damages,
and the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts
arising out of such settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment concurrently
with the effectiveness of such settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment
(unless otherwise provided therein) and (ii) obtain, as a condition of any
settlement, compromise, discharge, entry of judgment (if applicable), or other
resolution, a complete and unconditional general release of each Indemnified
Party from any and all liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any claim or demand for which it is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party, or admit to any liability
with respect to such claim or demand without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _ARTICLE X_
(including _Section 10.02_ and  _Section 10.03_), no Indemnifying Party
shall have any liability under this _ARTICLE X_ for any Losses arising out of
or in connection with any Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by
an Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnifying Party, except
as permitted under _Section 10.04(b)_ in cases where the Indemnifying Party
has failed to assume the compromise, settlement, defense or appeal of a Third
Party Claim.

 

(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 10.04(a)_ that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days following its receipt of such notice
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party under this _ARTICLE X_. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any such
claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

98 Section 10.05. _Payment_. In the event a claim or any Action
for indemnification under this _ARTICLE X_ has been finally determined, the
amount of such final determination shall be paid (i) if the Indemnified Party
is an Acquiror Indemnified Party, by the Parent to the Indemnified Party,
and (ii) if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, by the
Acquiror to the Indemnified Party, in each case on demand in immediately
available funds; provided, however, that Parent and Acquiror shall cooperate
to direct payment to the Parent or the Sellers on one hand, and the Acquiror
or any Designated Acquiror on the other hand, as the case may be, if doing so
would result in the indemnification payment made under this Agreement to be
treated as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price. A claim or an Action,
and the liability for and amount of damages therefor, shall be deemed to be
"finally determined" for purposes of this _ARTICLE X_ when the Parties to this
Agreement have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a
final non-appealable Governmental Order has been issued or entered into with
respect to such claim or Action.

 

Section 10.06. _Exclusive Remedies_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that,
following the Closing, except in cases of fraud and except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the indemnification provisions of this _ARTICLE X_
and, with respect to taxes, _Article VII_, shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedies (including equitable remedies that involve monetary
payment, such as restitution or disgorgement, other than specific performance
to enforce any payment or performance due hereunder) of the parties in
connection with any breach of a representation and warranty, or non-
performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any claims based upon
fraud be subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this
_ARTICLE X_.

Section 10.07. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) The Parent and the Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each
indemnification obligation set forth in _ARTICLE X_ of this Agreement or any
other certificate executed or delivered in connection with the Closing: (i)
Deductible Losses shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis; (ii) all Losses
shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds; (iii) in no event shall the
Parent have any liability or obligation to any Acquiror Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ with respect to the inaccuracy or breach of
a representation or warranty made by the Parent pursuant to this Agreement to
the extent that Losses resulting from or in connection with such inaccuracy or
breach have been recovered by the Acquiror in connection with the calculation
of the Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital; (iv) the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for any Losses to the extent incurred
in connection with the Indemnified Partys successful assertion, enforcement,
dispute or resolution of its indemnification or other rights under this
Agreement or the collection of any amounts payable to a Party under this
Agreement; (v) solely with respect to claims that are not Third Party Claims,
the Indemnified Party shall be liable to the Indemnifying Party for any
Losses to the extent incurred in connection with the Indemnifying Partys
successful defense of any claim by the Indemnified Party for indemnification
or other rights under this Agreement; (vi) in no event shall the Parent have
any liability or obligation to any Acquiror Indemnified Party to the extent
that any Loss, or any portion thereof, for which indemnification is sought
hereunder is specifically reflected or reserved for in the Final
Actual Closing Solvency Capital Worksheet and taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Actual Closing Solvency Capital; and (vii)
notwithstanding anything

 



 

99  contained in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of _ARTICLE VII_
and this _ARTICLE X_ , (A) a breach of a representation or warranty shall be
deemed to exist either if such representation or warranty is actually
inaccurate or breached or would have been inaccurate or breached if such
representation or warranty had not contained any qualification as to
materiality, or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or Material Adverse Effect
(which, in each case, instead will be read as any adverse effect or change) or
similar language, and (B) the amount of Losses in respect of any breach of a
representation or warranty, including any deemed breach resulting from the
application of clause (A), shall be determined without regard to any
limitation or qualification as to materiality, or Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect or Material Adverse Effect (which, in each case, instead will be read
as any adverse effect or change) or similar language set forth in such
representation or warranty.

(b) Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_
shall be paid promptly and without reduction, and payment shall not be delayed
pending any determination of Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case where an
Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any Eligible Insurance
Proceeds or any other amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying
Party has actually reimbursed it pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ , such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such Eligible Insurance Proceeds, but not in excess of the amount
actually reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim.

 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall treat
any indemnification payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Share Purchase Price.

(d) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may
be covered, in whole or in part, by third party insurance coverage, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
(a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the Indemnifying Party so requests within
180 days after receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek to collect insurance proceeds
under such third party insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party has no obligation to commence, or threaten or otherwise
seek to commence, any Action against any Person, including any Governmental
Authority, to collect insurance proceeds under such third party insurance
coverage.

 

Section 10.08. _Mitigation_. Except as otherwise specified herein, each of
the parties hereto agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder.

Section 11.03. _Public Announcements_. No party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate or Representative of such party shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or public announcement or otherwise
communicate with any news media in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or applicable
securities exchange rules, in which case to the extent practicable, the party
required to publish such press release or public announcement shall allow the
other party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of such publication. Prior to the Closing,
neither of the parties to this Agreement, nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, shall make any disclosure concerning plans or
intentions relating to the customers, agents or employees of, or other Persons
with significant business relationships with, the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries (including any of agents or Brokers) without first
obtaining the prior written approval of the other party, which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 11.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or
as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such



 

102  determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 11.05. _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the
Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent
not in conflict with this Agreement, between or on behalf of the Parent and/or
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on
the other hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction
Agreements. 

Section 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned, in whole
or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the parties hereto. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
_Section 11.06_ shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall
inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and
their successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without
the consent of the Parent, the Acquiror may transfer or assign (including by
way of a pledge), in whole or in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, any
or all of its rights hereunder (including its rights to seek indemnification
hereunder); _provided_ that no such transfer or assignment will relieve the
Acquiror of its obligations hereunder and such transfer shall cease to
be effective if such transferee ceases to be an Affiliate of the Acquiror.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, without the
consent of the Acquiror, the Parent may assign the right to receive the
Purchase Price and other payments to be made to Parent pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement (when and if such payments are made) to any of the Permitted
Parties; _provided_ that no such assignment will relieve the Parent of its
obligations hereunder and that no such assignee shall be deemed to be a
third-party beneficiary under this Agreement or have any legal or equitable
rights to enforce any provision of this Agreement and such assignees rights
shall be limited to the right to receive the Purchase Price and other
payments to be made to Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (when
and if such payments are made). For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the
Purchase Price to such assignee shall constitute full satisfaction of
the Acquirors obligations hereunder to pay the Purchase Price to the Parent
and the Sellers as contemplated in _ARTICLE II_.

 

Section 11.07. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
5.10_ with respect to directors, statutory auditors and officers of the
Companies and Transferred Subsidiaries, in _Section 5.11_ with respect to
Company Releasees and Parent Releasees, in _Section 7.01_ with respect to
Acquiror Indemnified Parties, and in  _Article X_ with respect to Parent
Indemnified Parties and Acquiror Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their permitted
successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person (including any policyholder
of any Company or Insurance Company except as explicitly provided in a Hold
Harmless Agreement) any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The Sellers shall be
express third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement and, as such, this
Agreement may be enforced by each of the Sellers as if it were a party hereto.

 



 

103 Section 11.08. _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
except by a written instrument signed by all the parties to such agreement. No
provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement may be waived
except by a written instrument signed by the party to such agreement against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law. 

Section 11.09. _Disclosure Schedules_. Matters reflected in any Section of
this Agreement, including any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or
other matter in any Section or Schedule of this Agreement shall be construed
as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or
that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or
disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or
Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 

Section 11.10. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without

Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the Parent and the Acquiror irrevocably and unconditionally:

 

(i) submits itself and its property in any Action arising out of or relating
to the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and

in the United States federal courts, the federal courts of the United States
located in the State of Delaware;

 

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and

same;

 



 

104 (iii) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected
by mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Party at its
address as provided in _Section 11.02_; and

 

(iv) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
New York.

(c) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 11.11. _Rules of Construction_. Interpretation of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements (except as specifically provided in any such
agreement, in which case such specified rules of construction shall govern
with respect to such agreement) shall be governed by the following rules of
construction: (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural
and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be held to include the other
gender as the context requires; (b) references to the terms Article, Section,
paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to the Articles, Sections,
paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified; (c) references to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars and "¥" shall mean
Japanese yen; (d) the word "including" and words of similar import when used
in the Transaction Agreements shall mean "including without limitation,"
unless otherwise specified; (e) the word "or" shall not be exclusive; (f) the
words "herein," "hereof" or "hereunder," and similar terms are to be deemed
to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section; (g) the
headings contained in the Transaction Agreements are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the
Transaction Agreements; (h) the Transaction Agreements shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the Party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted; (i) if a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of
such word or phrase have a corresponding meaning; (j) references to any
statute, listing rule, rule, standard, regulation or other Law include a
reference to (1) the corresponding rules and regulations and (2) each of them
as amended, modified, supplemented, consolidated, replaced or rewritten from
time to time; and (k) references to any section of any statute, listing rule,
rule, standard, regulation or other Law include any successor to such section.

 

Section 11.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without the necessity of posting bond
or other undertaking, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement,
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or
in equity. In the event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



 

105 Section 11.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement and each of the
other Transaction Agreements may be executed in one or more counterparts, and
by the different parties to each such agreement in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to any Transaction Agreement by
facsimile or other means of electronic transmission shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of any such Transaction
Agreement.

(a) Services or access to facilities, equipment or software not agreed upon in
a Schedule attached hereto but provided prior to the Closing by a Parent
Entity to an Acquiror Entity can be requested in writing within one hundred
twenty (120) days of the Closing by the Acquiror upon reasonable notice to the

_Additional Services_ ") and such access to such additional facilities,
equipment and software (the " _Additional Facilities_ ") in each case on the
terms and conditions (other than price) as were applicable to such services or

Agreed Price, for a term determined pursuant to Section 6.01 and with any
applicable reasonable Set-Up Costs and any termination charges, determined

proposed in writing by the applicable Provider within ten (10) Business Days

Additional Facility; if the Parties fail to reach agreement on the amount of
the Agreed Price, Initial Additional Service Term, or extension of such term
or any applicable termination charges or Set-Up Costs, such issues shall be
resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a), but any such failure to reach
agreement on the foregoing shall not delay the provision of the Additional
Service or access to Additional Facilities. The applicable _Schedule 2.01_ or
_Schedule 2.02_ shall be deemed amended to include the Additional Services and
access to Additional Facilities (along with the Agreed Price,
Initial Additional Service Term, extension of such term and termination
charges, if any), which shall be provided in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Additional Services shall be deemed to be
Scheduled Services hereunder and the Additional Facilities shall be deemed to

set forth on _Schedule 2.03(b)_ hereto.

Services are being used (or, with respect to any Service or access to
Facilities provided by the Parent or its Affiliates during the Pre-Closing
Period but that will not be provided by the Parent or its Affiliates following
the Closing, for thirty (30) days following the Closing). Knowledge Transfer
Services will be charged to the Acquiror or the applicable Affiliate of the
Acquiror receiving Knowledge Transfer Services at the Agreed Price plus any
related Pass-Through Charges incurred by the Parent or the applicable
Affiliate of the Parent providing such Knowledge Transfer Service; 
_provided_ , that there will be no charge for (i) _de minimis_ Knowledge
Transfer Services (which, by way of example, includes meetings (without travel
by Provider) or phone calls, in each case of one hour or less in
duration), (ii) transfer of written documentation regarding data systems or
the data environment, or (iii) Provider Costs other than incremental Provider
Costs incurred as a result of the use of additional labor employed by a
Provider, or additional materials, assets or other resources acquired by a
Provider, in order to provide such Knowledge Transfer Services, if and to the
extent Acquiror has approved Provider incurring such incremental Provider
Costs.

 

Section 2.05 _Third-Party Vendor Services_. Upon the Acquirors reasonable
written request, the Parent shall cooperate or cause its Affiliates to
cooperate in the Acquirors negotiation for a direct agreement with any Third-
Party Vendor (collectively, " _Third-Party Vendor Services_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Parent nor its Affiliates will be required to
amend any contract, pay any amount of consideration or otherwise enter into
any accommodation or undertaking with any such Third-Party Vendor in
connection with these Third-Party Vendor Services. Third-Party
Vendor Services shall be provided for no longer than the duration of the
particular associated Service or associated Facility for which such Third-
Party Vendor Services are being used. Third-Party Vendor Services will be
charged to Acquiror at the Agreed Price plus any related Pass-Through Charges
incurred by the Parent and its Affiliates in providing such Third-Party Vendor
Services; _provided_ , _however_ , that for Third-Party Vendor Services
provided in connection with the provision of Additional Services or access to
Additional Facilities, the Provider may charge any Overhead Costs incurred in
connection with providing such Additional Services or access to Additional
Facilities, if and to the extent Acquiror has approved Provider using such
Third-Party Vendor Services.

Section 2.06 [ _Reserved_ ].

 

Section 2.07 _Resumed Services_. If, within sixty (60) days following
termination by a Recipient of a Service or access to a Facility in accordance
with Section 6.01(c)(i), such Recipient concludes that such Service or access
to a Facility is still needed, the Recipient will so notify the applicable
Provider in writing, and such Provider will promptly resume providing such
Service or access to such Facility, if commercially reasonable and
technologically feasible. The Recipient shall be responsible for the Agreed
Price and related Pass-Through Charges of Provider associated with resuming
such Service or access to such Facility, and to the extent practicable, such
Provider shall provide such Recipient with an estimate (with reasonably
supportive detail) of such Agreed Price in advance of resuming such Service or
access to such Facility. Nothing in this Section 2.07 shall require a
Provider to retain any personnel, to maintain any facilities or systems or to
take, or refrain from taking, any other action, following a termination by a
Recipient of a Service in anticipation of or preparation for the possibility
of a Service or Facility being resumed pursuant to this Section 2.07. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Service or Facility resumed pursuant to this Section
2.07 will extend the term of such Service or Facility beyond the Scheduled
Term of such Service or Facility.

Section 2.08 _Exception to Obligation to Provide Services or Access to
Facilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
including Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, no Provider shall be obligated to
(and no Party shall be obligated to cause any Provider to) provide any
Service or access to any Facility, if the provision of such Service or access
to such Facility would (a) violate any applicable Law, (b) violate any
agreement, license or promise to customers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing limitation with respect to agreements, licenses and promises shall
only apply to any such agreement, license or promise entered into with an
unaffiliated third party prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement (each, a
" _Pre-Signing Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that Provider shall
promptly notify Recipient of any such Pre-Signing Agreement and any Service or
access to Facility

 



 

7  affected thereby; or (c) result in the disclosure of information subject to
any applicable privileges (including the attorney-client or similar
privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent and the Acquiror shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (w) subject to Section 5.05(e) and
Section 5.17 of the Purchase Agreement, obtain or cause to be obtained Third
Party Consents such that the Services or access to the Facilities might be
provided without violation of Law or any Pre-Signing Agreements, (x) make any
commercially reasonable changes with respect to the Services or access to the
Facilities such that they might be provided without violation of Law or any
Pre-Signing Agreements or disclosure of information subject to applicable
privileges, (y) if no such changes are reasonably possible, provide
commercially reasonable alternative sources of such Services or Facilities
and disclose or cause to be disclosed such information or its substantial
equivalent in such a way as to not constitute disclosure of privileged
information; and _provided_ , _further_ , the Provider shall continue to be
obligated to provide the Service or access to Facility to the extent that
doing so would not result in a violation of applicable Law, or any Pre-Signing
Agreements, or disclosure of privileged information. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 2.08 is intended to relieve a Party of its
obligations, or to modify the obligations, under Section 5.05(e) or Section
5.17 of the Purchase Agreement or Section 2.14 hereof.

 

Section 2.09 _Standard of the Provision of Services or Access to Facilities_.

agreements or targets in the event of a written notice by Recipient to the

same form and at the same times as provided during the Pre-Closing Period or
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties (the " _Reports_ ").

Section 2.11 _Failure to Meet Standards for Services; Inability to Perform_. 

(a) If a Recipient provides its corresponding Provider with a written notice
to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of any purported
failure to meet any standard of the Services or access to Facilities required
by this Agreement (a " _Service Shortfall_ "), as determined by such Recipient
in good faith, and if such Provider agrees that a Service Shortfall exists,
such Provider shall promptly rectify such failure at its own expense, using
commercially reasonable efforts, and reimburse Service Charges related to such
agreed Service Shortfall previously paid, or reduce such Service Charges not
yet paid, in an amount reasonably determined to compensate such Recipient for
the Service Shortfall; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in accordance with
Section 3.02, the Acquiror may withhold payment of an amount that
it reasonably determines in good faith would compensate such Recipient for
the Service Shortfall. Any disagreement as to whether a Service Shortfall has
occurred or as to any purported Service Shortfall (resulting in timing or
quality of performance of any Service falling materially below the standard
set forth in Section 2.09) that is not promptly rectified to such Recipients
reasonable satisfaction shall be rapidly and timely escalated and resolved in
accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) on an expedited basis.

(b) To the extent that any Provider fails to provide, or fails to
timely provide, any Service or access to any Facility as required under this
Agreement or fails to meet the applicable standards for any Service or access
to any Facility as set forth herein, unless such failure resulted primarily
from the act or omission of Recipient (even if such failure to provide
Service or access to a Facility is excused by Force Majeure pursuant to
Section 6.04 hereof), then Recipient and Recipients Affiliates shall have no
obligations or liability hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreement
for failure to meet their obligations hereunder or under any other Transaction
Agreement to the extent such failure by Recipient or its Affiliates is
attributable to Providers failure to provide, to timely provide, or to meet
the applicable standards with respect to such Service or access to a Facility
until such time as such Provider cures such failure to the extent required to
enable Recipient or its Affiliates to resume fulfilling such
obligations hereunder or under the other applicable Transaction Agreements.



 

8 Section 2.12 _Change in Services or Access to Facilities_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.09, a Provider may, from time to time, reasonably
supplement, modify, substitute or otherwise alter (" _Change_ ") the Services
and access to the Facilities provided by it in a manner that does not
adversely affect in any material respect the quality or availability of such
Services or access to such Facilities or increase the cost to Recipient of
receiving or using such Services or accessing such Facilities; _provided_ ,
that to the extent that any such Change is reasonably likely to modify,
substitute or otherwise alter the receipt or use of such Services or access to
such Facilities, Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance
written notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of the
implementation of the Change to the extent practicable under the
circumstances.

 

(b) Each Recipient may request in writing any Change to a Service or access to
a Facility, which request shall include a description of the proposed Change
requested and the associated business specifications (a " _Change Request_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any proposed Change requested pursuant to such
Change Request shall not result in any material change to the manner of
provision or the contents of the Services or access to the Facilities that are
the subject of such Change Request; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that
(i) any upgrades or changes to a Service or access to a Facility that are
made in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, system
upgrades, configuration changes, changes to the environment and installation
of new releases, shall in no event be regarded as "material changes" and (ii)
any disputes as to whether a Change Request results in any "material change"
shall be resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i). Provider shall have
ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of the Change Request (unless
otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties) to provide Recipient with
a written proposal (a " _Change Request Proposal"_ ), prepared at the Agreed
Price at Recipients expense. Provider and Recipient shall then engage in
good faith negotiations regarding such Change Request, including with regard
to the estimated time and price of implementing the Change Request (including
any Third-Party Consents necessary to implement the Change Request) and any
potential impact of the Change Request on then-existing Services or access to
Facilities. For the avoidance of doubt, the estimated price for any Change
Request shall be determined using the Agreed Price. If the Parties agree
in writing upon a Change Request Proposal or a written variation thereof, the
Schedules hereto (if applicable) shall be deemed amended to include the terms
and conditions of such agreed-upon Change Request.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change is required by applicable Law
or is in response to a New Security Threat, a Provider shall make, at its own
initiative or upon the request of a Recipient, any and all changes to the
Services or the access to the Facilities necessary to comply with applicable
Law and any changes thereto or to respond to such New Security Threat (any
such changes to the Services or access to the Facilities, a " _Required
Change_ "); _provided_ , that (i) such Provider shall provide Recipient with
reasonable advance written notice to the applicable service manager and
Contract Manager of the implementation of any Required Changes, and (ii) any
disputes arising in connection therewith shall be rapidly and timely escalated
and resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) on an expedited basis. The
Recipient shall pay to the Provider the Agreed Price for such Required Change
and any related Pass-Through Charges incurred by the Provider in making any
Required Changes and will pay any incremental Agreed Price and related Pass-
Through Charges incurred by the Provider in providing the Services or
providing access to the Facilities after implementation of the Required
Change. The Recipient will receive the benefits of any incremental reduction
in the Agreed Price enjoyed by the Provider in providing the Services or
providing access to the Facility after implementation of the Required Change;
_provided_ , that with respect to a change in Law or New Security Threat that
is applicable to the businesses of both Provider and the Recipient,
the Parties will share on a pro rata basis in the Agreed Price and related
Pass-Through Charges incurred by the Provider in making any Required Change,
the incremental Agreed Price and related Pass-Through Charges incurred by the
Provider in providing the Services after implementation of the Required
Change and the benefits of any incremental reduction in the Agreed Price
enjoyed by the Provider in providing the Services after implementation of the
Required Change. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing
of any changes in applicable Law or New Security Threat that may relate to the
provision or receipt of the Services or access to the Facilities.

 

Section 2.13 _Services and Access to Facilities Provided by Other Persons_.
The Parent may engage or cause any Person, including any Affiliate of the
Parent to provide any Service or access to any Facility or any



 

9  portion thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Person and all Services
or access to Facilities provided by such Person shall be subject to
confidentiality and security provisions at least as stringent as those herein
and to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including service standards,
and that the Parent shall remain responsible for the performance by such
Person of all of its obligations hereunder with respect to the Services or
access to the Facilities provided by such Person so that such performance is
in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice
to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of its intention to
engage such Person to provide such Services or access to such Facilities, or
any portion thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that the engagement of any
Person that is not either (i) an Affiliate of the Parent either as of the
date hereof or as of the date such engagement occurs, (ii) providing the same
or similar Services or access to Facilities to the Acquiror during the Pre-
Closing Period, or (iii) a Person providing Services or access to Facilities
after the Closing to a Recipient and concurrently providing similar Services
or access to Facilities to the Acquiror shall be subject to the Acquirors
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Parent shall cause any such Person that is an
Affiliate of the Parent to waive any existing restriction or constraint on its
Work Product, any requirement for consent, and any other term of service or
performance (and, if applicable, shall not impose such other new terms) that
would prevent or impede such Person from providing the Services or the access
to Facilities in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 2.14 _Consents_. The Parent shall obtain or cause its Affiliates and
Persons providing Services or providing access to Facilities on its behalf to
obtain any Third Party Consents necessary for the Services to be provided to
and received by the applicable Recipient and for the access to Facilities to
be provided to and received by the applicable Recipient and to use any
deliverables (including Work Product) provided in connection therewith and
shall either (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
necessary Third Party Consent from any Person that is not an Affiliate of the
Parent or (b) in the event such Third Party Consents are not obtained,
immediately notify the applicable Recipient and provide commercially
reasonable alternative arrangements reasonably acceptable to the applicable
Recipient for the provision of such Services or access to Facilities
consistent with existing service levels and the standards set forth in Section
2.09. All out-of-pocket costs of Third Party Consents or providing such
acceptable alternative arrangements with respect to the Scheduled Services,
access to the Scheduled Facilities and Additional Services and access to
Additional Facilities shall be equally split between the Parent and the
Acquiror. The applicable Recipient shall bear the costs of any Third Party
Consents for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Resumed
Services, Migration Services and Changes made pursuant to a Change Request;
and the cost of any Third Party Consents for a Required Change shall be
allocated in accordance with the second and third sentences of Section
2.12(c).

Section 2.15 _Dedicated Assets and Dedicated Third-Party Agreements_.
_Schedule 2.15_ sets forth certain equipment and other assets owned by the
Parent Entities (" _Dedicated Assets_ ") and certain agreements between one or
more Parent Entities and Persons that are not Affiliates of the Parent ("
_Dedicated Third-Party Agreements_ "), which in each case will be used
exclusively to provide Scheduled Services. If, within sixty (60) days prior to
the scheduled date of termination of a Service (whether such date appears on
a Schedule or is set forth in a notice of termination given pursuant to
Section 6.01), the Acquiror delivers written notice to the Parent that the
Acquiror elects to acquire any Dedicated Asset used to provide such Service,
the Parent shall sell such Dedicated Asset to the Acquiror on the date of such
scheduled termination at a price equal to the net book value of such Dedicated
Asset as of the last day of the quarterly fiscal period completed immediately
prior to such notice date. Upon the Acquirors reasonable written request
delivered to the Parent within sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled date of
termination of a Service (whether such date appears on a Schedule or is
set forth in a notice of termination given pursuant to Section 6.01), the
Parent shall cooperate or cause its Affiliates to cooperate in the Acquirors
negotiation of an assignment to an Acquiror Entity of any Dedicated Third-
Party Agreement used to provide such Service or in Acquirors paying off any
obligations owed under any Dedicated Third-Party Agreement, including by way
of Parent or its Affiliates providing a letter of agency to allow the Acquiror
to be assigned, or to assume obligations under, any Dedicated Third-Party
Agreement, in either case effective on the date of such scheduled termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Parent nor its Affiliates will be
required to pay any consideration or otherwise enter into any accommodation
or undertaking with any counterparty to such Dedicated Third-Party Agreement
in connection with such assignment. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not
an agreement is a Dedicated Third-Party Agreement listed on _Schedule 2.15_ ,
the Parent and its Affiliates will not assign any agreements to an Acquiror
Entity that do not exclusively relate to the provision of the Scheduled
Services.

 



 

10 Section 2.16 _Personnel_.

 

(a) The Parent shall, and shall cause the Provider of any Service or access to
any Facility to make available to the Recipient of such Service or access to
such Facility such personnel as may be necessary to provide such Service or
access to such Facility; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to Section
2.09, the Provider shall have the right, in its reasonable discretion, to (i)
designate which personnel it will assign to perform such Service or provide
access to such Facility and (ii) remove and replace such personnel at any
time. Subject to Section 2.09, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate a
Provider (or the Parent to cause any Provider) to hire any additional
employees or provide any incentives to employees in addition to those in
effect immediately prior to the Closing or to retain the employment of any
particular employee or retain the services of any particular consultant,
contractor or agent.

(b) The Provider of any Service or access to any Facility shall be solely
responsible for all (i) salary, employment and other benefits and liabilities;
(ii) payroll, employment, social security, workers compensation, unemployment,
disability and similar taxes (including all withholding taxes on such
payments or benefits) and (iii) compliance with all employment, immigration
and any other applicable Laws, in the case of (i) through (iii) relating to
the personnel of such Provider assigned to perform such Service or provide
access to such Facility. In performing their respective duties hereunder, all
such personnel of a Provider shall be under the direction, control and
supervision of such Provider and, subject to Section 2.09 and Section
2.16(a), such Provider shall have the sole right to exercise all authority
with respect to the employment (including termination of employment),
assignment and compensation of such personnel.

 

(c) The Parties hereby agree that the employees of the Acquired Entities
listed in _Schedule 2.16(c)_ hereto (the " _Seconded Employees_ ") have been
seconded to American International Group K.K. (" _AIG KK_ ") in accordance
with the terms of the respective secondment agreements between the Acquired
Entities and AIG KK listed on _Schedule 2.16(c)_  hereto (the " _Secondment
Agreements_ ") and for the purpose of performing job functions related to the
Services and access to the Facilities provided hereunder. The Seconded
Employees will remain at all times employees of the Acquired Entities, to the
extent applicable, but they shall, at all times during the Secondment Term (as
defined below), work under the direction, supervision and control of AIG KK or
one of its Affiliates. All contractual salary and benefits due and payable to
the Seconded Employees during the Secondment Term shall be in accordance with
the Secondment Agreements. For each Seconded Employee, the "Secondment Term"
shall be that period of time from such employees initial secondment pursuant
to the Secondment Agreements until the earlier of: (i) completion of the
period provided in _Schedule 2.01_ for the provision of the Services in which
such Seconded Employee is engaged or (ii) the termination of this Agreement
for whatever cause. Upon completion of a Seconded Employees Secondment Term
such Seconded Employee shall immediately cease working under the direction,
supervision and control of AIG KK or any of its Affiliates, as applicable,
and such Seconded Employee shall be transferred to the applicable Acquiror
Entity.

Section 2.17 _Cooperation_. Each Party agrees to perform all obligations
under this Agreement in good faith and to use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the other in all matters relating to the provision and
receipt of the Services and access to the Facilities. In furtherance of the
foregoing: (a) each Party shall timely notify the other in writing as soon as
practicable in advance of any circumstances that could have a material adverse
effect on the Services or the access to the Facilities or security and work
with the other Party to minimize the effect of such circumstances; (b) each
Party shall timely provide information and documentation reasonably requested
by the other Party to be used in the provision or receipt of Services and
access to Facilities hereunder; and (c) each Recipient and its Affiliates
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate with the applicable
Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the provision of any Service and
access to any Facility and (ii) enable the applicable Provider and its
Affiliates to provide the Services and access to the Facilities in accordance
with this Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law, no Recipient or its
Affiliates shall take any action that would interfere with or materially
increase the cost of a Providers providing any of the Services or access to
any of the Facilities.

 

Section 2.18 _Security; Electronic and Other Access_.

 

(a) The Parties shall work together (i) to ensure that each Provider is able
to maintain or exceed its current level of security during the term of this
Agreement and (ii) to address any New Security Threat, (including compliance
with applicable Law (including Privacy Laws) related to such New Security
Threat) or the security and protection of Personally
Identifiable Information, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Provider shall
not be required to take



 

11  action in connection with the foregoing (ii) except under a Required Change
The Acquiror shall be entitled to perform, with reasonable advance written
notice, audits of the data and physical, electronic and systems security
procedures in effect at the locations where the Provider is providing Services
or access to any Facilities , which audits shall be of the type and conducted
in a manner that is reasonable under the circumstances of the provision of
services, access to facilities, equipment, software and other assistance on a
transitional basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such right to perform
audits shall include the ability to perform Statement of Auditing Standards
70 Type II audits if such audits are required by a Governmental Authority. At
the Acquirors request, the Provider shall, in accordance with Section 2.17,
provide such cooperation as is required to conduct and complete such audits.

(b) As of the Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Purchase
Agreement or in this Agreement or as expressly agreed to in writing by the
Parties, (i) the Acquiror Entities shall cease to use and shall have no
further access to, and the Parent shall have no obligation to otherwise
provide or make available, any business or other services, including any
Parent Entitys intranet and other owned, licensed, leased or used computer
software, networks, hardware or technology of a Parent Entity, provided or
made available to the Acquiror Entities by any Parent Entity prior to
the Closing and (ii) the Acquiror Entities shall have no access to, and the
Parent Entities shall have no obligation to otherwise provide, any Parent
Entitys computer-based resources (including third-Person services, e-mail and
access to its computer networks, databases and equipment), whether or not
such resources require a password or are available on a secured access basis
or on a non-secured access basis.

 

(c) To the extent that the performance or receipt of Services or access to
Facilities hereunder requires any Party or Provider to have access to the
other Partys or its Affiliates Systems (including third-Person services,
e-mail and access to computer networks, database and equipment) owned,
licensed, leased or used by such other Party or its Affiliates (" _Required
Technology_ "), such other Party or its Affiliates shall provide limited
access to such Required Technology in accordance with applicable Law
(including Privacy Laws) and subject to the security, use, Virus
protection, disaster recovery and confidentiality policies and procedures
(including physical security, network access, Internet security,
confidentiality and Processing of Personally Identifiable Information and
security guidelines and procedures) of such Provider, as they may be amended
from time to time, provided that such policies were in effect at the time of
such access and are made known to the other Partys personnel who are seeking
such access prior to such access (the " _Security Regulations_ "). The Parent
and the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause the Parent
Entities and the Acquiror Entities, as the case may be, and all of their
respective personnel having access to the Required Technology to (i) comply
with all of such Partys or its Affiliates Security Regulations that are
applicable to the provision of any Service or access to any Facility; (ii) not
tamper with, compromise or circumvent any security or audit measures employed
by such Party or its Affiliate whose Required Technology is being accessed;
(iii) execute a separate system access agreement, upon commercially reasonable
terms, with such Party or its Affiliate; (iv) ensure that only those users
who are specifically authorized by such Party or its Affiliates, as the case
may be, gain access to the Required Technology; and (v) use commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized destruction, alteration or loss
of information contained therein by such users. The rights of access to the
Required Technology granted hereunder shall be restricted to user access only,
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, and shall not include
privileged or higher level access rights or rights to functionality. Other
than as specifically permitted under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements, no Person shall have any rights of access to the other Partys
Required Technology or Systems. 

(d) While Services are being provided hereunder, each Party shall take
commercially reasonable measures to ensure that, in connection with the
provision or receipt of any Services or access to any Facilities, no Virus or
similar items are coded or introduced into either its own (including its
Affiliates) or the other Partys (including its Affiliates) Systems. If, in
connection with the provision of any Services or access to any Facilities, a
Virus is found to have been introduced into such Systems, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and to diligently work
together with the other Party, each at its own cost, to eliminate the effects
of such Virus.

(e) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Providers and
Recipients to, exercise commercially reasonable care or such higher standard
that may be required by applicable Privacy Laws to prevent unauthorized
Persons from accessing the Services, Facilities, Personally Identifiable
Information, Required Technology or other Systems of the other Party and its
Affiliates, including (i) promptly terminating the rights of any user under
its control that has sought to circumvent or has circumvented the
applicable Security Regulations, (ii) immediately notifying (verbally and
then in writing) the other Party if it learns that an unauthorized Person has
accessed or may access any Required Technology or other Systems of such other
Party or that a Person has engaged in activities that



 

12  may lead to the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration or loss of
Personally Identifiable Information, or other data, information or software
whether on such other Partys Required Technology or other Systems, and (iii)
immediately implementing the notification procedures and actions required by
Section 7.02.

 

(f) Each Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and other
Providers to cooperate, fully and in a timely way with any investigation,
audit or review relating to the security of Personally Identifiable
Information, the Facilities, the Required Technology or other Systems that
arises in connection with this Agreement, including providing any relevant
information or material in its possession or under its control that is
reasonably requested by the other Party (but excluding internal audit reports
and external audit opinions other than a reasonably detailed summary of the
portions thereof that describe or address any exceptions from compliance
policies or practices that are pertinent to the Services or the Facilities).

(g) Subject to Section 7.02, the Contract Managers shall be advised promptly
(both orally, if practicable, and in any event in writing) of any material
breach of the provisions of this Section 2.18 or any breach of the Security
Regulations or unauthorized access to Personally Identifiable Information,
the Required Technology, Facilities or other Systems used hereunder. If such
breach has not been rectified or such unauthorized access has not been
terminated within three (3) days from the notice to the Contract Managers,
the matter shall be immediately escalated to the Contract Managers and
resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) on an expedited basis. On
reasonable advance written notice to the applicable Contract Manager, and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party may audit the other Partys
use of the Required Technology or other Systems used in providing or receiving
the Services or access to Facilities solely with respect to security and
compliance with the applicable Security Regulations no more than once every
calendar year, unless in connection with a Security Incident.

 

(h) Each Provider shall use the same level of effort and services as used or
caused to be used, to recover or recreate Providers own lost data prior to
the Closing Date but in no event less than a commercially reasonable effort,
to recover or recreate any data lost or destroyed in performing any Services
or providing access to any Facility due to Providers negligence, at
Providers cost. In addition, each Provider shall, at the reasonable request
of Recipient, use commercially reasonable efforts (or as otherwise required by
applicable Law) to restore or procure the restoration of such Personally
Identifiable Information to its state immediately prior to any corruption or
loss.

Section 2.19 _No Agency_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed in any
way or for any purpose to constitute any Party acting as an agent of another
unaffiliated Party in the conduct of such other Partys business. A Provider
of any Service or access to any Facility hereunder shall act as an
independent contractor and not as the agent of any Recipient or its Affiliates
in performing such Service or providing access to such Facility.

 

Section 2.20 _Ownership of Intellectual Property; Ownership of Data_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or in the
Purchase Agreement, each of the Parent and the Acquiror and their respective
Affiliates shall retain all right, title and interest in and to their
respective Intellectual Property (including Work Product, as provided for
herein) and any and all improvements, modifications and derivative works
thereof. No license or right, express or implied, is granted under this
Agreement by the Parent, the Acquiror or their respective Affiliates in or to
their respective Intellectual Property, except that, solely to the extent
required for the provision or receipt of the Services or access to the
Facilities in accordance with this Agreement, each of the Parent and the
Acquiror, for itself and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, hereby
grants to the other (and their respective Affiliates) (" _Licensee_ ") a non-
exclusive, fully paid up, royalty-free, worldwide, revocable (only as
expressly set forth herein), non-transferable (except as provided in Section
7.06) license during the term of this Agreement to such Intellectual
Property, but only to the extent and for the duration necessary for the
Licensee to provide or receive the applicable Service or access to the
applicable Facility as permitted by this Agreement. Upon the expiration of
such time, or the earlier termination of such Service or access to such
Facility in accordance with Section 6.01(d), the license to the relevant
Intellectual Property will terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject
to Section 6.03(a), all licenses granted hereunder shall terminate
immediately upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof. The foregoing license is subject to any
licenses granted by others with respect to Intellectual Property not owned by
the Parent, the Acquiror or their respective Affiliates.



 

13 (b) All right, title and interest (including Intellectual Property rights) in
the results and proceeds of the Services performed hereunder and the access
to Facilities, including all materials, products, reports, computer programs
(source or object code), documentation, deliverables and inventions developed
or prepared by Provider in performance of such services (the " _Work Product_
") that is created exclusively on behalf of the Acquiror and its Affiliates or
the Business (subject to Section 2.20(a)) (the " _Acquiror Work Product_ ")
shall be owned exclusively by the Acquiror (as between the Acquiror and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Parent and its Affiliates on the other),
in whatever stage of completion such Acquiror Work Product may exist from time
to time. All such Acquiror Work Product shall be considered "works made for
hire" (within the meaning of the United States Copyright Law) of the Acquiror.
In the event such Acquiror Work Product is for any reason or in any
jurisdiction determined not to be "works made for hire" or that title to any
such Acquiror Work Product may not vest in the Acquiror or its Affiliates by
operation of applicable Law or otherwise, then the Parent hereby assigns and
shall cause its Affiliates or applicable Providers to assign all right, title
and interest (including Copyrights) in such Acquiror Work Product to the
Acquiror, and Acquiror shall reimburse the Parent for its and its Affiliates
or the applicable Agreed Price related to such actions. All such Acquiror
Work Product, where practicable, shall bear Acquirors Copyright and trade
secret notices, as specified by the Acquiror, and Acquiror shall reimburse the
Parent for its and its Affiliates or the applicable Agreed Price related to
such actions. No rights to Acquiror Work Product shall remain with the Parent
or its Affiliates following the end of the term of this Agreement.

 

(c) All right, title and interest (including Intellectual Property rights) in
Work Product that is created hereunder and that is not Acquiror Work Product
shall belong to the Provider that created such Work Product (the " _Provider
Work Product_ ") (as between Provider and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Recipient and its Affiliates on the other), in whatever stage of completion
such Provider Work Product may exist from time to time, unless otherwise
agreed to by the Parties in writing. In the event that in any jurisdiction
ownership of the Provider Work Product does not vest in such Provider or
its Affiliates by operation of applicable Law or otherwise, then the
Acquiror, as Recipient, hereby assigns and shall cause its Affiliates to
assign all right, title and interest (including Intellectual Property rights)
in such Provider Work Product to the applicable Provider, and such Provider
shall reimburse the Acquiror for the Agreed Price related to such actions.
Each Provider grants each Recipient a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-
free, worldwide, perpetual and irrevocable and only to the extent necessary
for Recipient to receive the Services license for Recipient to copy, prepare
derivative works of, distribute, display, perform and otherwise use such Work
Product (including, in the case of Work Product that is software, any source
code or executable or object code) in such Recipients business and that of
such Recipients Affiliates.

(d) If a Provider hereunder that is not an Affiliate of the Parent entered
into agreements with the Parent or its Affiliates prior to the Closing, which
agreements allocate title in work product to such Provider or another third
party, then the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
for the applicable Recipient at the Recipients expense, (i) in the case of
Work Product to be owned by such Recipient, a non-exclusive, fully paid-up,
royalty-free, transferable, worldwide, perpetual and irrevocable license for
Recipient to copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute, display, perform
and otherwise use such work product in such Recipients business and that of
such Recipients Affiliates and (ii) in the case of Work Product to be owned
by Provider, a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferable,
worldwide license to use the work product in accordance with Section 2.20(a).
In the event that such licenses cannot be obtained, the Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an alternative at the Recipients
expense.

 

(e) The Parent, as Provider, and its Affiliates will (i) promptly provide each
Recipient with written notice to the applicable service manager and the
Contract Manager of any restrictions, terms and conditions on Recipients
rights in Work Product otherwise owned by such Recipient (arising solely from
third-party rights, and not rights of Provider or its Affiliates) and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts, in consultation with Recipient, to remove
or minimize such restrictions, terms and conditions.

 

(f) During the term of this Agreement, each Provider will make reasonable
efforts to provide Recipient, upon Recipients request, with access to and
delivery of the Work Product owned by such Recipient.

(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or in any other
Transaction Agreement, no Party (or its Affiliates) shall have any rights or
licenses with respect to any Intellectual Property (including software),
hardware or facility of the other Party. All rights and licenses
not expressly granted in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement
are expressly reserved by the relevant Party. Each Party shall from time to
time, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute any documents and take any
other actions reasonably requested by the other Party to effectuate the
intent of this Section 2.20.



 

14 (h) All Recipient Data is, will be and will remain the property of the
Recipient or any of its designees and will be deemed Confidential Information
of such Persons. The Recipient or such designees shall have all right, title

Section 2.21 _Divestitures_.

 

(a) If the Parent sells or divests any Affiliate that provides Services or
access to Facilities hereunder or assets that are used to provide Services or
access to Facilities hereunder, the Parent shall provide, or cause the
divested Affiliate or another Person to provide, for the continuity of
Services and access to Facilities on the same price, terms and conditions as
are in effect immediately prior to such sale or divestiture, and in a manner
which does not cause a degradation in any material respect in the service
standards set forth herein and without requiring a material change to the
Recipients business processes or operations.

(b) If the Acquiror sells or divests any Affiliate that receives Services or
access to Facilities hereunder, the Parent shall provide and shall cause its
Affiliates to provide for continuity of Services and access to Facilities on
the same price, terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to
such sale or divestiture, and in a manner which does not cause a degradation
in the service standards set forth herein; _provided_ , that the Parent shall
not be required to incur any material additional costs or to make any material

to Facilities to such Affiliate on the same price, terms and conditions as are
in effect immediately prior to such reorganization, and in a manner which does
not cause a degradation in any material respect in the service standards set

material additional costs or to make any material change to the manner in
which the Parent provides such Services or access to Facilities.

Section 2.23 [ _Reserved_ ].

 

Section 2.24 _Migration_.

 

(a) The Parties agree to use, and to cause their respective Affiliates that
are Providers or Recipients to use, their reasonable good faith efforts to
cooperate with and assist each other in connection with the migration of the
Business or the Acquiror Entities from the Parent and the Seller to the
Acquiror, in each case and to the extent reasonably agreed by the Parties,
taking into account the need to minimize both the cost of such migration and
the disruption to the ongoing business activities of the Parties and their
respective Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, to the extent that the Parties
have not already done so prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall (i)
identify the respective tasks to be accomplished by each Party in connection
with the orderly migration from the performance of any Service or provision of
access to any Facility by a Provider to the performance of such Service and
provision of access to such Facility by a Recipient, its Affiliates or a third
Person (the " _Migration Services_ "), (ii) agree upon the terms by which
Provider will provide such Migration Services and (iii) agree to the period
during which the Migration Services are to be provided. Any disputes between
the Parties as to the identification of, terms of or Schedule for Migration
Services shall be rapidly and timely escalated and resolved in accordance
with Section 7.09(a)(i) on an expedited basis.



 

15 (b) The Parties acknowledge that Migration Services may include the provision
of services requested by a Recipient in connection with its migration to non-
Provider Systems, including the transfer of records, segregation and migration
of historical data, migration-specific enhancements and cooperation with and
assistance to third-Person consultants engaged by such Recipient in
connection with the foregoing. Migration Services shall be charged to the
Party or Affiliate of such Party that is receiving Migration Services (the "
_Migration Services Recipient_ ") at the Agreed Price plus related Pass-
Through Charges (less any VAT or Sales Tax recoverable by the Migration
Services Provider or any of its Affiliates) incurred by the Party that is
providing such Migration Services (the " _Migration Services Provider_ ") in
the provision of Migration Services; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent that the Migration Services for a particular Service are provided by
human resources, or utilize equipment or third-party services, that are
otherwise being used to provide such particular Service (and, therefore, are
included in the calculation of the Service Charge for such Service), there
shall be no additional charges for such Migration Services beyond the Services
Charge;  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that for any human resources,
equipment or third-party services that Provider retains in order to provide
Migration Services beyond those otherwise used to provide such particular
Service, then, if and to the extent that an authorized representative of
Recipient specifically authorizes in writing the use thereof, such Recipient
may be charged the incremental costs incurred by Provider for such additional
resources, equipment or services. 

Section 2.25 _Primary Points of Contact for this Agreement_.

 

(a) Each Party shall appoint an individual to act as the primary point of
operational contact for the administration and operation of this Agreement,
as follows:

(i) The individual appointed by the Acquiror as the primary point of
operational contact pursuant to this Section 2.25(a) (the " _Acquiror
Contract Manager_ " identified on _Schedule 2.25_ ) shall have overall
operational responsibility for coordinating, on behalf of the Acquiror, all
activities undertaken by the Acquiror and the Acquiror Entities and their
Affiliates and Representatives hereunder, including the performance of the
Acquirors obligations hereunder, the coordination of the provision of the

contact with the Parent Contract Manager and making available to the Parent
the data, facilities, resources and other support services from the Acquiror
required for the Parent Providers to be able to provide the Services and
access to the Facilities in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement. The Acquiror may replace the Acquiror Contract Manager with an
employee or officer with comparable knowledge, expertise and decision-making
authority from time to time upon written notice to the Parent pursuant to
Section 7.03(b). The Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such change.

 

(ii) The individual appointed by the Parent as the primary point of
operational contact pursuant to this Section 2.25(a) (the " _Parent Contract
Manager_ " identified on _Schedule 2.25_ ) shall have overall operational
responsibility for coordinating, on behalf of the Parent, all activities
undertaken by the Parent Providers and their Affiliates and Representatives
hereunder, including the performance of the Parents obligations hereunder,
the coordination of the provision of the Services and access to the Facilities
with the Acquiror, acting as a day-to-day contact with the Acquiror Contract
Manager and making available to the Acquiror the data, facilities, resources
and other support services from the Parent required for the Acquiror Entities
to be able to receive the Services and access to the Facilities in accordance
with the requirements of this Agreement. The Parent may replace the Parent
Contract Manager with an employee or officer with comparable knowledge,
expertise and decision-making authority from time to time upon written notice
to the Acquiror pursuant to Section 7.03(b). The Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice of any such change.

 

(iii) In addition to the responsibilities set forth in Section 2.25(a)(i) and
Section 2.25(a)(ii) and Section 7.09(a), the Contract Managers shall have the
authority to approve in writing modifications to the Services, access to
Facilities, the terms on which the foregoing are provided and the Schedules
hereto.

 

(b) The Parties shall ensure that the Parent Contract Manager and the Acquiror

necessary or advisable for the performance of the Parties obligations
hereunder, but in no event less than weekly for the first six (6) months of
the term and no less than every other week during the remainder of the
term. In addition, at least once per quarter during the term of this
Agreement, the Contract Managers and the senior executives identified in
Section 7.09(a) shall meet to discuss this Agreement and any issues arising
hereunder.

 



 

16 Section 2.26 _TSA Records_.

 

(a) During the Scheduled Term of any Service or access to any Facility and for
an additional period thereafter as required by applicable Law and/or the
Parents record retention policies that are provided to Recipient (but in no
event shall such additional period be fewer than twelve (12) months after the
end of such Scheduled Term), the Parent shall each maintain, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Providers to maintain, true and
correct records of all receipts, invoices, reports and other documents
relating to the services rendered and activities performed hereunder in
accordance with applicable Law and its standard accounting and record
management practices and procedures, consistently applied, which practices and
procedures are employed by the Parent or such Providers (as applicable) in
their provision or receipt of services for themselves and their Affiliates.

(b) As and when so reasonably requested by Recipient for purposes of verifying
invoices submitted to Recipient pursuant to Article III and/or any Providers
performance of the Services, or by a Governmental Authority acting pursuant to
applicable Law, the Parent shall cause each Provider to permit at reasonable
times and from time to time, but in no event more than one inspection per
year, by the Acquiror and/or its external auditors (an " _Inspection_ ")
wherein such Provider shall (i) make books and records concerning the Business
(but excluding Providers internal audit reports and external audit opinions,
other than a reasonably detailed summary of the portions thereof that describe
or address any exceptions from compliance policies or practices that are
pertinent to the Services or the Facilities), the calculation of any fees or
Taxes, the performance of Services or access to Facilities provided pursuant
to this Agreement (including IT infrastructure and general IT controls) and/or
the invoices submitted to the Acquiror pursuant to Article III, available for
inspection and copying by such Person(s) as the Acquiror designates as its
authorized representative(s), who shall, subject to the terms of Section 7.01,
have the right to take copies of or extracts from any such books and records,
and (ii) give the Acquirors representatives reasonable access during regular
business hours to facilities, officers, employees and other representatives of
such Provider, including attorneys, accountants and others, in connection
with such Inspection without disruption of the business operations of such
Provider.

(c) If it is determined pursuant to the dispute resolution process in Section
7.09 or any legal proceeding between the Parties, or the Parties otherwise
agree, that an Inspection has revealed that the Parent has overcharged the
Acquiror for Services or access to Facilities for any billing period, the
Parent promptly shall credit (or, if the applicable Provider has ceased
providing Services or access to Facilities, promptly shall refund) the
Acquiror for the amount of the overcharge plus interest thereon calculated
from the date of the Acquirors payment of the overcharge using the applicable
Interest Rate. The costs and expenses incurred by the Recipient and the Parent
and its Affiliates in connection with an Inspection shall be borne by
Recipient unless the overcharge exceeds ten percent (10%) of the actual amount
owed for the applicable billing period, in which event the costs and expenses
incurred by the Recipient and the Parent and its Affiliates in connection with
such Inspection shall be borne by the Parent.

ARTICLE III

 

COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS

 

Section 3.01 _Costs and Disbursements_.

 

As consideration for providing the Services and access to the Facilities:

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth on the applicable Schedule, the Acquiror
shall cause the Recipient of any Service set forth in  _Schedule 2.01_ or
access to any Facility set forth in _Schedule 2.02_ to pay to the applicable
Provider the amount specified next to such Service or Facility in the
applicable Schedule, as it may be amended prior to Closing (with respect to a
Service or Facility, the " _Service Charge_ " for such Service or Facility),
subject to any reduction thereof made pursuant to the last sentence of Section
2.15. For the avoidance of doubt and not including Pass-Through Charges, Set-
Up Costs, termination charges pursuant to Section 6.02(b) and Third Party
Consents, the Service Charge shall be the amount set forth on the applicable
Schedule and such amount shall not be subject to any additional increase
except as contemplated by Section 6.01. In addition, except as otherwise set
forth



 

17  on the applicable Schedule or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties,
each Recipient shall pay the Agreed Price for Knowledge Transfer Services,
Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, Migration Services received
by such Recipient and for any actual incremental costs of resuming any Resumed
Services (it being understood that, in the absence of any such incremental
costs, Resumed Services shall be charged at the same amounts as were
specified in the applicable Schedule for the Scheduled Service or access to a
Facility). Each months Service Charges and charges for Knowledge Transfer
Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, Resumed Services
and Migration Services (pro-rated if applicable to less than a full calendar
month) for such Recipient shall be (X) set forth in an invoice (which invoice
or related documentation shall provide reasonable detail regarding
the calculation of the amount set forth in the invoice unless such amount is
a fixed amount set forth in a Schedule hereto) from the Provider and submitted
to the applicable Recipient, sent in electronic format to the applicable
Person at such Recipient designated to receive such invoices, with copies of
all such invoices sent simultaneously in electronic format to the applicable
Contract Manager, and with all amounts due calculated and payable in the
currency of the Recipient, unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
otherwise designated in the applicable Schedule, or otherwise agreed to by the
Parties in writing; _provided_ , that regardless of the currency of the
Recipient, in the event that the business unit AIG KK is the Provider such
charges shall be in Japanese yen and in the event that the business unit AIG
Global Services is the Provider such charges will be in U.S. dollars, and (Y)
payable in arrears, unless otherwise specified for each Service in  _Schedule
2.01_ or _Schedule 2.02_. The Acquiror shall cause the applicable Recipient to
pay all such amounts set forth in such invoice and not disputed pursuant to
Section 3.02 via electronic funds transfer (instructions to be separately
provided), within thirty (30) days of the applicable Recipients and Contract
Managers receipt of the invoice.

 

" _Agreed Price_ " shall (I) apply only to Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-
Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, Migration Services and to any
actual incremental costs of resuming any Resumed Services, (II) exclude any
Pass-Through Charges and (III) be determined as follows, with no additional
charges for Provider Costs, Overhead Costs or any other costs (except as
expressly set forth below and in Section 2.05 hereof):

(i) Where the Parties can agree upon a fee or method of fee calculation
regardless of past practice, such fee or method of fee calculation shall be
used (" _Agreed Service Fee_ ") and the Agreed Price shall be the product of
(A) the Agreed Service Fee and (B) 1.2.

(ii) If there is no Agreed Service Fee, where an internal rate exists (the "
_Applicable Rate Card_ ") that would apply to the Service or access to the
Facility that is charged on a unit basis, the Agreed Price shall be the
product of (A) the unit charge set forth on the then-current Applicable Rate
Card, (B) the number of units used and (C) 1.2.

(iii) If there is no Agreed Service Fee or Applicable Rate Card and an
hourly rate can be applied with respect to the Service, access to the
Facility, a portion of such Service or a portion of access to such Facility,
the Agreed Price for such Service, access to such Facility, portion of such
Service or portion of access to such Facility shall be $175 per hour (unless
the Provider of such Service, access to Facility, portion of such Service or
portion of access to such Facility is located in Japan, in which case the
Agreed Price for such Service, access to such Facility, portion of such
Service or portion of access to such Facility shall be ¥15,640 per hour) (an "
_Hourly Rate_ ").

 

(iv) If there is no Agreed Service Fee or Applicable Rate Card and an Hourly
Rate cannot be applied to the Service, access to the Facility, a portion of
such Service or a portion of access to such Facility and the Provider has
historically charged for such Service or Facility by allocating its total
Provider Cost among all of the recipients of its services or access to its
facilities in proportion to the percentage each such recipient represents of
such Providers total Provider Cost, the Agreed Price for such Service,
Facility, portion of such Service or portion of access to such Facility shall
be the product of (A) the total Provider Cost of such Provider for all
services and access to all facilities provided by such Provider to Recipients
pursuant to this Agreement and to recipients other than pursuant to this
Agreement, (B) the proportion of such Providers total Provider Cost that is
attributable to such Recipient and (C) 1.2.

 

(v) If there is no Agreed Service Fee or Applicable Rate Card, an Hourly Rate
cannot be applied to the Service, access to the Facility, a portion of such
Service or a portion of access to such Facility, and the Provider has not
historically charged for such Service or Facility by allocating its total
Provider Cost among 



 

18  all of the recipients of its services or access to its facilities in
proportion to the percentage each such recipient represents of such Providers
total Provider Cost, the Agreed Price for such Service, Facility, portion of
such Service or portion of access to such Facility shall be the Fully-Burdened
Cost.

(b) Except as otherwise set forth on the applicable Schedule, in addition to
any Service Charges, the Acquiror shall cause the Recipient to pay to the
Provider any actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid to any unaffiliated
third Person (less any VAT or Sales Tax recoverable by the Provider or any of
its Affiliates) of the type set forth in _Schedule 3.01(b)_ , incurred by a
Provider in the provision of any Services or access to any Facilities
(collectively, the " _Pass-Through Charges_ ") including any Pass-Through
Charges specified on _Schedule 2.01_ or _Schedule 2.02_ or otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Parties; _provided_ , that all travel expenses that are
included as a Pass-Through Charge shall only be reimbursed in accordance with
Recipients travel policies previously provided in writing to the Parent and
the Provider. Pass-Through Charges in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000)
for a single expense will not be incurred without the prior written approval
of the applicable Recipient; _provided_ , that if such applicable Recipient
does not approve the incurrence of such expense, the Parent and the Acquiror
shall discuss in good faith commercially reasonable alternatives to the
incurrence of such expense; and _provided_ , _further_ that if the Parent and
the Acquiror do not agree to a commercially reasonable alternative to the
incurrence of such expense and the applicable Recipient still does not
approve the incurrence of such expense, then the applicable Provider may
terminate the Service related to such Pass-Through Charge within fifteen (15)
Business Days of delivering a written notice to such effect to the Acquiror in
accordance with Section 7.03(b) and to the applicable Contract Manager,
unless, during such fifteen (15) Business Day period, the Recipient approves
the incurrence of such expense. Pass-Through Charges shall be set forth in an
invoice in reasonable detail and with reasonable back-up from the Provider
and without any mark-up or additional fee and shall be submitted to the
applicable Recipient in electronic format sent to the applicable Person at
Recipient designated to receive such invoices, with copies of all such
invoices sent simultaneously in electronic format to the Acquiror Contract
Manager, and with all amounts due calculated and payable in the currency of
the Recipient, unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
otherwise designated in the applicable Schedule, or otherwise agreed to by
the Parties in writing. The Acquiror shall cause the applicable Recipient to
pay all amounts for such Pass-Through Charges set forth in such invoice and
not disputed pursuant to Section 3.02 via electronic funds transfer
(instructions to be separately provided), within thirty (30) days of the
Recipients and Acquiror Contract Managers receipt of the invoice.

 

(c) [Reserved].

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, all consideration paid
under this Agreement is exclusive of any sales, transfer, goods or services
tax, VAT or similar gross-receipts-based tax (including any such taxes that
are required to be withheld, but excluding all other taxes, including taxes
based upon or calculated by reference to income, gain or capital) imposed
against or on services provided (" _Sales Taxes_ ") by a Provider hereunder
and such Sales Taxes will be added to the consideration to be paid to a
Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the Provider) where applicable. Such
Sales Taxes shall be separately stated on the relevant invoice submitted to
the Recipient (or the Acquiror on behalf of the Recipient) and in
circumstances where VAT is chargeable in respect of any supply made under this
Agreement, the Provider shall promptly deliver a valid VAT invoice in respect
of such supply to the Recipient (or the Acquiror on behalf of the Recipient).
All taxable goods and services for which the Recipient is compensating, or
reimbursing, the Provider shall be set out separately from non-taxable goods
and services, if practicable. The Recipient (and the Acquiror on behalf of the
Recipient) shall be responsible for any such Sales Taxes and to the extent
such taxes are payable by a Provider (or the Parent, as the case may be,
on behalf of the Provider) to the relevant taxing authority, the Recipient
(or the Acquiror on behalf of the Recipient) shall either (i) remit an amount
equal to such Sales Taxes to the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the
Provider), and the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the Provider) shall
account for such amounts to the applicable taxing authority, or (ii) provide
the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the Provider) with a certificate or
other acceptable proof evidencing an exemption from liability for such Sales
Taxes of the relevant Service provided hereunder. In the event the Provider
(or the Parent on behalf of the Provider) fails to invoice Sales Taxes on
taxable goods or services covered by this Agreement in a timely manner, the
Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the Provider) shall notify the Recipient
(or the Acquiror on behalf of the Recipient) in a timely manner and the
Recipient (or the Acquiror on behalf of the Recipient) shall remit an
amount equal to such Sales Taxes (where relevant following the provision of a
valid VAT invoice) to the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the Provider);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Recipient shall not be responsible for the
payment of any additions to such Sales Taxes, including penalties and
interest imposed due to a failure by the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of
the Provider) to account for such Sales Taxes or

 



 

19  cause them to be accounted for in a timely manner to the appropriate taxing
authority except where such failure was due to the Recipients breach of any
obligation herein. For the avoidance of doubt, except where determined or as
required by applicable Law, the Person responsible for remitting the Sales Tax
to the Tax Authority shall be determined in accordance with past practice as
between such Recipient and Provider. Notwithstanding any other proviso, the
Recipient shall not be required in any case to indemnify the Provider for any
(x) penalties, interest or additions to tax imposed with respect to a Sales
Tax to the extent such amounts are imposed due to a failure by the Provider
(or the Parent on behalf of the Provider) to collect, remit or account for any
such taxes to a taxing authority timely or timely file any tax return relating
to such taxes except where such failure was directly due to the
Recipients breach of any obligation herein or (y) taxes other than Sales
Taxes and, to the extent that any tax other than a Sales Tax is required to be
withheld or deducted by the Recipient, the Recipient (or the Acquiror on
behalf of the Recipient) has the right to withhold or deduct the amount of
such tax from any consideration under this Agreement and such amount shall be
treated as paid for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the amount required to be remitted by or with respect to Sales Tax
shall be reduced by the amount of any such Sales Tax that is recoverable,
refundable or creditable to the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the
Provider) or for which the Provider (or the Parent on behalf of the Provider)
is reimbursed or held harmless against by another party (other than an
indemnity set forth under this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, the
amount required to be remitted by the Recipient (or the Acquiror on behalf of
the Recipient) with respect to VAT for purposes of this Agreement shall not
be reduced by reference to any amounts accounted for by or on behalf of the
Provider or an Affiliate of the Provider and which are recoverable, refundable
or creditable to the Provider or an Affiliate of the Provider as input VAT.

Section 3.02 _No Right to Set-Off; Disputed Invoice Amounts_. The Acquiror
shall pay or cause the applicable Recipient that is its Affiliate to pay to
the Parent or the applicable Provider the full amount of undisputed Service
Charges, charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services,
Resumed Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges, other amounts
required to be paid on behalf of each Recipient under this Agreement and
except as permitted by this Section 3.02 or as otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, shall not set-off, counterclaim or otherwise withhold any amount
owed or claimed to be owed under this Agreement on account of any obligation
owed by or on behalf of a Provider, whether or not such obligation has been
finally adjudicated, settled or otherwise agreed upon in writing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Acquiror or its applicable
Recipient disputes any specific amount on an invoice, or the Acquiror
reasonably and in good faith determines an amount to compensate a Recipient
for a Service Shortfall pursuant to Section 2.11, the Acquiror shall notify
the Parent and the applicable Provider in writing and describe in detail the
reason for disputing such specific amount or the amount to so compensate
Recipient, respectively, and the Acquiror shall have no obligation to pay
such amount during the pendency of the dispute with respect to such amount and
may withhold any such amount to compensate Recipient. The Parties shall use,
and shall cause the respective Recipient and Provider to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with respect to such
amounts. If the respective Recipient and Provider or the employees or their
designees at the Parent and the Acquiror responsible for preparing
and reviewing the invoices are unable to reach an agreement about any such
amounts within ten (10) Business Days after such written notification has been
received, the matter shall be rapidly and timely escalated and resolved in
accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) hereof on an expedited basis. Upon
resolution of the dispute, including an amount to compensate a Recipient for a
Service Shortfall, if any, the Acquiror shall promptly pay, or cause its
Affiliate that is the applicable Recipient to promptly pay, the applicable
amount, if any, as determined by the process used in Section 7.09(a)(i).

ARTICLE VI

 

TERM AND TERMINATION

 

Section 6.01 _Term and Termination_.

 

(a) Each Scheduled Service and access to each Facility shall be provided for a
term (the " _Initial Scheduled Term_ ", and together with any extended term
as provided in this Section 6.01(a), the " _Scheduled Term_ ") commencing on
the Closing Date and ending, in each case, unless extended pursuant to this
Section 6.01, on the date set forth with respect to such Scheduled Service or
such scheduled access to a Facility in _Schedule 2.01_ (in the case of
Services) or _Schedule 2.02_ (in the case of access to Facilities),
respectively, or such shorter term if earlier terminated pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding any date on such
Schedule, the Initial Scheduled Term of any Service provided by American
International Group K.K. shall be twelve (12) months. Upon the provision of
written notice to the applicable service manager and the Contract Manager,
Recipient may (i) with at least ninety (90) days(and forty-five (45) for any
Service for which the Initial Scheduled Term is three (3) months) written
notice prior to the end of the Initial Scheduled Term, extend any Initial
Scheduled Term for an extended term commencing from the last day of the
Initial Scheduled Term for a number of months up to and including the end
of the eighteenth (18th) month after the Closing Date (the " _First Extended
Term_ "), with no increase in the Service Charge for such Scheduled Service or
access to Facility during such First Extended Term, (ii) with at least forty-
five (45) days written notice prior to the end of the First Extended Term,
extend such First Extended Term for an additional three (3) month term (the "
_Second Extended Term_ ") with the Service Charge for such Scheduled Service
or scheduled access to a Facility increasing by ten percent (10%) from and
after the date that is the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month after the
Closing Date, and (iii) with at least forty-five (45) days written notice
prior to the end of the Second Extended Term, extend the Second Extended Term
for an additional three (3)



 

22  month term (" _Third Extended Term_ "), with the Service Charge for such
Scheduled Service or scheduled access to a Facility during the Third Extended
Term increasing by another ten percent (10%) over the Service Charge charged
during the Second Extended Term (for a cumulative increase of twenty percent
(20%)) from and after the date that is last day of the twenty-first (21st)
month after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Service
for which the Initial Scheduled Term is either three (3) or six (6) months,
the First Extended Term may not extend beyond the end of the twelfth (12th)
month after the Closing Date and no further extensions are permitted
thereafter. Any Additional Service or access to an Additional Facility shall
terminate upon the date (the " _Initial Additional Service Term_ ") that is
the earlier of (i) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date or
(ii) such date as shall be mutually agreed to in writing by the Parties on the
Schedule reflecting such Additional Service or access to an Additional
Facility; _provided_ , that, except as otherwise agreed on such Schedule, the
Initial Additional Service Term may be extended in the same manner and subject
to the same conditions, including increases in Service Charges, as set forth
in this Section 6.01(a) with respect to Scheduled Services;  _provided_ ,
further, that the sum of the Initial Additional Service Term and such Extended
Additional Service term shall not exceed twenty-four (24) months total.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the
contrary, to the extent either Partys (X) failure to complete Migration or
Knowledge Transfer Services in accordance with the time frames agreed to by
the Parties and the standards set forth herein or (Y) failure to provide a
Scheduled Service or scheduled access to a Facility in accordance with the
standards set forth herein prohibit or materially diminishes the ability of a
Recipient to terminate a Service or access to a Facility during the Initial
Scheduled Term, Initial Additional Service Term, or any extension of such
initial terms (the " _Agreed Terms_ "), as applicable, such Agreed Term, as
well as the term for any related Migration Services, Knowledge Transfer
Services and Third Party Vendor Services shall be extended, without penalty
to the Recipient, for a reasonable amount of time, to be agreed to by the
Parties, to enable the Recipient to terminate such Service or access to a
Facility. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the length of
such extension, the dispute shall be rapidly and timely escalated and
resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) on an expedited basis.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the term for providing any Service or access to any
Facility as set forth in _Schedule 2.01_ or _Schedule 2.02_ , respectively,
(i) a Service or access to a Facility may be terminated earlier by the Parent
if the Acquiror has failed to pay Service Charges due and owing to the Parent
or its Affiliate that is a Provider (unless the Acquiror or Recipient is
disputing an invoice pursuant to Section 3.02) related to such Service or
access to such Facility and the Acquiror fails to cure such breach within
thirty (30) days of the Parent delivering a written notice of such breach
to the Acquiror in accordance with Section 7.03(b); (ii) a Service or access
to a Facility may be terminated earlier by the Acquiror if the Parent is in
material breach of the terms of this Agreement related to such Service or
access to such Facility and the Parent fails to cure such breach within
thirty (30) days of the Acquiror delivering a written notice of such breach to
the Parent in accordance with Section 7.03(b); (iii) the Acquiror may
terminate this Agreement if the Parent commences a voluntary case or other
proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to
itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now
or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part
of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of
or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other
proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors or shall take any corporate action to authorize any of
the foregoing; and (iv) the Parent may terminate this Agreement if the
Acquiror or all of the Acquiror Entities commence a voluntary case or other
proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to
itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now
or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part
of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of
or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other
proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors or shall take any corporate action to authorize any of
the foregoing.

 

(c) With respect to any Service or access to any Facility:

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Schedule, a Recipient may
terminate such Service or access to such Facility (A) upon mutual agreement
of the parties or (B) for any reason or no reason upon providing at least
ninety (90) days prior written notice to the applicable service manager and
the Contract Manager of the Provider of such Service or access to such
Facility and with no obligation to pay any applicable termination charges
pursuant to Section 6.02 or otherwise, _provided_ , _however_ , that as to any
termination pursuant to this clause (B), (1) Services that are collectively
priced may only be terminated as a



 

23  whole and may not be terminated individually; and (2) a Recipient may not,
during the Initial Scheduled Term, terminate on ninety (90) days prior notice
such Service or access to such Facility, if, in accordance with the
applicable Schedule, it is provided by American International Group, K.K..
Nothing in this Section 6.01(c)(i) affects Recipients right and ability to
reduce, at any time and for any reason, usage of any Service for which the
Service Charges are usage-based (e.g., email boxes) and that any such
reduction shall result in an immediate proportionate usage-based reduction in
the Service Charges for such Service;

 

(ii) a Provider may terminate such Service or access to such Facility, in
whole but not in part with respect to such Service or access to such
Facility: within ten (10) days after receipt by the Recipient of such Service
or access to such Facility of written notice to the applicable service manager
and the Contract Manager, if the continued performance of such Service or the
provision of access to such Facility would be a violation of any Law;
_provided_ , that during the ten (10) days following such notification, the
Contract Managers shall discuss in good faith how to provide such Service or
access to such Facility or an equivalent service or equivalent access to a
facility, equipment or software without a violation of Law pursuant to Section
2.12(c).

 

If a Service or access to a Facility is terminated, the relevant Schedule, if
applicable, shall be updated to reflect such termination. In the event
that the effective date of the termination of any Service or access to any
Facility is a day other than at the end of a month, the Service Charge,
charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services,
Additional Services, Resumed Services and Migration Services, the Pass-
Through Charges and other amounts due to a Provider associated with such
Service or access to such Facility shall be pro-rated appropriately. Within
ten (10) Business Days following receipt of a notice of termination in
accordance with Section 6.01(c)(i), Provider shall send to the applicable
service manager and the Contract Manager for Recipient a written notice that
either (X) states that the Service or access to Facilities for
which termination is requested has no dependencies and can be terminated on
the requested date or (Y) to the extent that a Providers ability to provide a
Service or access to a Facility, as the case may be, is dependent on the
continuation of another Service or access to another Facility that the
Recipient seeks to terminate, describes any such dependency to such Recipient,
in which case the Service or access to a Facility sought to be terminated
shall not terminate and the Parties shall work in good faith to determine how
and when such Service or access to such Facility can be terminated.

(d) Each Recipient may from time to time request a reduction in part of the
scope or amount of any Service or access to any Facility or the partial
termination thereof by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager for the
Provider of such Service in access to such Facility, in which case the Parties
shall cause the applicable Provider and Recipient to discuss the feasibility
of such a reduction or partial termination in good faith and the appropriate
reductions in scope or amount to the relevant Service Charges or other
applicable charges in light of all relevant factors, including the costs and
benefits to the Provider of any such reductions. If the Recipient and
the applicable Provider agree on the terms of such reduction or partial
termination, which terms shall be in writing and approved by the Contract
Managers, then the relevant Schedule, if applicable, shall be updated to
reflect any such reduced Service or access to such Facility and the Provider
shall provide the reduced or partially terminated Service or access to
Facility in accordance with the agreed-to terms.

 

Section 6.02 _Termination Charges_. Upon the early termination of any
Additional Service or Additional Facility pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(i), the
Recipient shall reimburse the Provider the amount of fifty percent (50%) of
all "kill" fees and other similar fees actually paid by the Provider or any of
its Affiliates to unaffiliated third parties that were engaged solely in
order to provide such Additional Service or Additional Facility, which fees
were incurred in connection with the early termination of the Additional
Service or Additional Facility and to the extent such "kill" fees and similar
fees would not have been incurred had Recipient continued to receive the
applicable Additional Service or Additional Facility for the originally
contemplated Additional Service Term thereof, as the case may be. Each
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the existence
and amount of such early termination charges, "kill" fees and similar fees.
All termination charges, "kill" fees and similar fees due and payable under
this Section 6.02 shall be due and payable to the Provider in accordance with
Article III.



 

24 Section 6.03 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Upon termination of any Service or access to any Facility in accordance
with this Agreement and subject to Section 6.02, the Provider of such
terminated Services or such terminated access to the applicable Facility will
have no further obligation to provide such terminated Service or such
terminated access to the applicable Facility, and the Recipient of such
terminated Services or such terminated access to the applicable Facility
shall have no obligation to pay any Service Charges, charges for Knowledge
Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, Resumed
Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges and other amounts
relating to any such terminated Service or such terminated access to the
applicable Facility; _provided_ , that the Recipient of such terminated
Services or such terminated access to the applicable Facility shall remain
obligated to the Provider for any Service Charges, charges for Knowledge
Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, Resumed
Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges and other amounts owed
and payable in respect of such terminated Service or such terminated access
to the applicable Facility that was provided prior to the effective date of
termination. Any and all rights to Intellectual Property granted to a
Recipient and/or Provider hereunder in connection with the provision of a
terminated Service or terminated access to the applicable Facility shall
immediately cease upon such termination, except to the extent such
Intellectual Property is needed for such Recipient to fulfill its obligations
under, or obtain the benefits under, this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements. In connection with the termination of any Service or access to any
Facility, the provisions of this Agreement not relating solely to
such terminated Service or such terminated access to the applicable Facility
shall survive any such termination.

(b) As promptly as practicable upon termination of this Agreement, or, if
applicable, upon earlier termination of any particular Service or access to a
Facility (i) each Party will deliver, or will cause to be delivered to the
other Party, all materials and property in its possession or control (or the
possession or control of an Affiliate) which is owned by or licensed to such
other Party or its Affiliates (including any Work Product owned by such Party
or its Affiliates in whatever state of completion as well as any data and
Confidential Information owned, licensed or leased by such Party), and (ii)
the Parties shall make a good faith effort to delete from their Systems (and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Providers that are not
Affiliates to delete from their Systems) all Work Product, data and
Confidential Information owned, licensed or leased by the other Party or its
Affiliates that are no longer needed for the Party to fulfill its obligations
under, or obtain the benefits under, this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require either
Party to delete any Confidential Information data or Work Product from any
back-up or disaster recovery media; _provided_ , that such Work Product data
and Confidential Information is not accessed or used for any purpose other
than restoration of information and data of such Party commingled with such
Work Product and Confidential Information;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
such back-up or disaster recovery media is securely disposed of or recycled in
accordance with the Partys policies and practices, which in all cases shall
be commercially reasonable and meet industry standards.

(c) In the event that Provider or its Affiliates have purchased any resources
in the name of or on behalf of Recipient or its Affiliates and has fully
charged such purchase as a Pass-Through Charge or if Provider has licensed any
resources solely in connection with the provision of Services or access to
Facilities for Recipient or its Affiliates and fully charged such license as
a Pass-Through Charge (each, an " _Acquired Resource_ "), then upon payment of
such Pass-Through Charge, Provider shall: (i) transfer to Recipient all right,
title and interest that Provider holds in such Acquired Resource and (ii)
deliver such Acquired Resource to such Recipient at no additional charge,
except for any charges incurred by Provider in transferring the Acquired
Resource, which shall be paid by the Recipient, upon the termination of the
last Service or termination of access to the last Facility hereunder for which
such Acquired Resource is necessary; _provided_ , _however_ , that for any
Acquired Resource that is a license for Intellectual Property, the
Provider shall be obligated to transfer and deliver such Acquired Resource to
the Recipient only if it has licensed such Acquired Resource in the name of or
on behalf of Recipient or its Affiliates. Provider agrees to exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts to license any such Acquired Resource in the
name of or on behalf of Recipient or its Affiliates and, in the event it is
unable to do so or reasonably believes it will not be able to do so, it shall
so notify the Recipient in writing prior to acquiring or attempting to
acquire such license and the Provider and the Recipient shall discuss in good
faith commercially reasonable alternatives that could be licensed in the name
of or on behalf of the Recipient; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the
Provider and the Recipient do not agree to a commercially reasonable
alternative within fifteen (15) days of commencement of such good faith
discussions, the Recipient shall provide written notice to the Provider that
either (X) states that Provider may license such Acquired Resource in the name
of Provider or (Y) provides notice, under Section 6.01(c)(i), of termination
of the Service for 



 

25  which the Intellectual Property is required. The Provider shall not be
liable for any delay in the provision of a Service or access to Facility that
occurs during the fifteen (15)-day discussion period between the Parties
solely to the extent that such delay is caused by the inability to obtain the
Acquired Resource in the name of Recipient. Each Party shall from time to
time, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute any documents and take any
other actions reasonably requested by the other Party to effectuate the intent
of this Section 6.03(c), and the Recipient shall reimburse such Provider or
its Affiliates their Agreed Price related to such actions.

 

(d) In connection with the termination of this Agreement, Article I, Article
V, Article VII, Section 2.20, Section 6.02, this Section 6.03 and Section
6.04, and liability for all due and unpaid Service Charges, charges for
Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services,
Resumed Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges and other
amounts required by this Agreement shall continue to survive indefinitely.

Section 6.04 _Force Majeure_. 

(a) No Party (or any Person acting on its behalf) shall have any liability or
responsibility for any interruption, delay or other failure to fulfill any
obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this Agreement so long as
and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of a Force
Majeure, _provided_ , that such Party (or such Person) shall have exercised
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of a Force Majeure on
its obligations, including, if applicable, implementing its disaster
recovery and/or business continuity plans. In the event of an occurrence of a
Force Majeure, the Party whose performance is affected thereby shall give
notice (orally or in writing) to the applicable service manager and Contract
Manager of suspension as soon as reasonably practicable to the other stating
the date and extent of such suspension and the cause thereof, and such non-
performing Party shall resume the performance of such obligations as soon as
reasonably practicable upon the cessation of such Force Majeure and its
effects.

(b) During the period of a Force Majeure affecting the Provider, the Recipient
shall be entitled to seek an alternative service provider with respect to the
Services affected or access to the Facilities affected and the Provider and
the Recipient will split equally the incremental cost increase for any such
alternative service provider. If a Force Majeure shall continue to exist for
more than fifteen (15) consecutive days, the Recipient shall be entitled to
permanently terminate the Services affected or access to the Facilities
affected with no termination charges due pursuant to Section 6.02 or
otherwise in connection with such termination. The Recipient shall be relieved
of the obligation to pay any Service Charges, charges for Knowledge Transfer
Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services and Resumed
Services, Migration Services Charges, Pass-Through Charges and other amounts
for the provision of the affected Services or access to the affected
Facilities throughout the duration of such Force Majeure.

extent that the Provider is required to retain such Personally Identifiable
Information in accordance with applicable Laws (including Privacy Laws) or
Providers own data retention policies.

 

Section 7.02 _Security Incidents_.

 

(a) In the event that either Party discovers (i) any material breach of its
security safeguards or measures or the Systems used to provide the Services
or access to Facilities including any incidents that are the subject of
Section 2.18(g) or (ii) any breach or threatened breach of its security
safeguards or measures that involves or may reasonably be expected to involve

Section 7.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 7.05 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
constitute the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, between or on behalf of the Parent and/or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on the
other hand, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.06 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that either Party may assign any or
all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates so long as such assignment does not release such Party from any
liability under this Agreement incurred prior to such assignment. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this Section 7.06 shall be void. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns.

Section 7.07 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Article V
with respect to Indemnified Persons, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person (including any Client Company or any policyholder of the Company or any
of the Insurance Subsidiaries) any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Any Provider
who is an Affiliate or, immediately prior to the Closing, was an Affiliate of
either Party, shall be an express third-party beneficiary under this Agreement
solely with respect to such Providers rights and, as such, such Provider may
instruct the Parent, and the Parent shall, enforce this Agreement on
Providers behalf as if such Provider were a party hereto.

 

Section 7.08 _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by
all the Parties. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 



 

30 Section 7.09 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising from, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all claims and defenses arising out of or relating to any such
transaction or this Agreement or the formation, breach, termination, or
validity thereof (a " _Dispute_ ") shall be resolved as follows: the
service managers of the Parties most immediately responsible for the issue
giving rise to the Dispute shall seek to resolve such Dispute through informal
good faith negotiation. If the Dispute is not resolved at that level of
management, then the Dispute shall be escalated to the Parent Contract
Manager and the Acquiror Contract Manager for resolution in good faith. In the
event such Contract Managers fail to meet or, if they meet, fail to resolve
the Dispute within an additional ten (10) Business Days (or such longer time
as the Contract Managers may agree), then the claiming Party will provide the
other Party with a written " _Notice of Dispute_ ", describing the nature of
the Dispute, and the Dispute shall be escalated to the members of senior
management at the Acquiror and the Parent set forth in _Schedule 7.09(a)_ for
resolution in good faith. In the event such senior executives fail to meet, or
if they meet, fail to resolve the Dispute within five (5) Business Days after
such Dispute has been escalated to them by the Contract Managers, then the
Dispute shall be escalated to the senior administrative executives at the
Acquiror and the Parent set forth in _Schedule 7.09(a)_ , or their respective
designees who shall meet within five (5) Business Days and confer in a good
faith effort to resolve the Dispute. If the senior administrative executives,
or their respective designees fail to resolve the Dispute within five (5)
Business Days, the Parties shall retain all rights under applicable Law and
this Agreement with respect to such Dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 7.09(b), the procedures set forth in this Section 7.09(a) must
be satisfied as a condition precedent to a Party commencing any legal
proceeding, and a Partys failure to comply with such procedures shall
constitute cause for the dismissal without prejudice of any such legal
proceeding.

 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Dispute arising under
Section 2.03(b), Section 2.11(a), Section 2.12(c), Section 2.18(g), Section
2.24, Section 3.02, Section 6.01(a) or Section 7.02(d), or as otherwise agreed
to by the Parties in writing, the Dispute shall be immediately referred to the
Contract Managers, who shall have five (5) Business Days to resolve the
Dispute (or such shorter time if the Contract Managers agree that they cannot
resolve the Dispute) before escalation to the senior executives along with the
applicable Notice of Dispute. Thereafter, the procedures and time frames set
out beginning in the fourth sentence of Section 7.09(a) shall apply.

 

(ii) Each Party may replace the designated member of senior management or
executive level administrative officer with an employee or officer with
comparable knowledge, expertise and decision-making authority from time to
time upon written notice to the other Party pursuant to Section 7.03(b). The
applicable Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at
least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such change.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions herein to the contrary, each Party
hereby acknowledges that money damages may be an inadequate remedy for a
breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of
ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered in the event that
this Agreement is breached. Therefore, in the event of a breach or anticipated
breach of this Agreement by the other Party or its Affiliates, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Party may, in
addition to any other remedies available to it, seek an injunction, on written
notice to the other Party in accordance with this Section 7.09(b) in a court
described in Section 7.10(b) to prohibit such breach or anticipated breach.
Each Party acknowledges and agrees that an injunction is a proper, but not
exclusive, remedy available to each Party and that the harm from any breach or
anticipated breach of the covenants set forth in this Agreement would be
irreparable and immediate. 

Section 7.10 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
claims and defenses arising out of or relating to any such transaction or
this Agreement or the formation, breach, termination or validity of this
Agreement, shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflicts
of Law principles of such state that would apply the Laws of another
jurisdiction.



 

31 (b) Each of the Parent and the Acquiror irrevocably and unconditionally:

 

(i) submits for itself and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Courts of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law,
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the United States federal courts, the
federal courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware in any
Action directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the formation, breach,
termination or validity of this Agreement and agrees that all claims in
respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined solely in such
courts;

 

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in such court or that such court is an
inconvenient forum for the Action and agrees not to assert, plead or claim the
same;

 

(iii) agrees that the final judgment of such court shall be enforceable in any
court having jurisdiction over the relevant party or any of its assets;

(iv) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in Section 7.03(b); and

 

(v) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the applicable rules of
procedure.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIM OR
DEFENSE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY SUCH TRANSACTION OR THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE FORMATION, BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 7.10. EITHER PARTY MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY. 

Section 7.11 _Rules of Construction_. Interpretation of this Agreement shall
be governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words in the singular

ARTICLE II. _LICENSE_.

 

SECTION 2.1 _Grant of License_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent hereby grants to each Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-
free, non-sublicensable,



 

2  non-transferable license to use the Licensed Marks within the Territory,
during the Term, in connection with all current and future policies, goods and
services within the respective business of each Licensee as conducted as of
the Effective Date solely: ( _a_ ) to the extent and in the exact form that
the Licensed Marks exist as of the Effective Date and were used by such
Licensee prior to the Effective Date in its business,  _provided_ , that
inadvertent and immaterial departures therefrom shall not be regarded as a
material breach of the foregoing license; and ( _b_ ) for such Licensees
corporate name, if applicable, solely in the exact form used by such Licensee
within the eighteen (18) months immediately prior to the Effective Date. For
clarity, a Licensee will not be deemed to use a Licensed Mark outside the
Territory if such use is on a website owned or controlled by Licensee that
is directed towards residents in the Territory, even if such website may be
accessed from outside the Territory.

 

SECTION 2.2 _Domain Names_. For clarity, any domain names containing the
Licensed Marks that are registered in any Licensees name as of the Effective
Date are not included within the definition of "Licensed Marks" in this
Agreement, and each Licensee agrees ( _i_ ) promptly to transfer any of same
(including all related records) to Parent for no consideration and ( _ii_ )
to maintain and renew all such registrations until the time of such transfer.
Further, any domain names containing the Licensed Marks that are registered in
Parents name and used by any Licensee as of the Effective Date (as set forth
on Exhibit E hereto) (the " _Redirected Domains_ ") are not included within
the definition of "Licensed Marks" in this Agreement, but Parent agrees that
for the six (6)-month period from the Closing Date, it will use the
Redirected Domains solely to direct or redirect Internet traffic ( _a_ ) at
Licensees request, to one or more Internet websites designated and controlled
by Acquiror and its Affiliates or ( _b_ ) if Licensee does not request such
redirection, to an inactive web page. Throughout the Term, Parent shall ( _a_
) maintain the registrations for each of the domain names "stardirect.jp",
"starlife.jp", "starlifedirect.com" and "starlifedirect.jp"; ( _b_ ) ensure
that any Internet traffic to such domain names is directed or redirected to an
inactive web page; and ( _c_ ) use such domain names solely for the purpose
of such direction or redirection. To the extent requested by Parent, each
Licensee shall reimburse Parent or its designee for all amounts paid by Parent
to renew and maintain the foregoing domain names, to the extent that such
renewal covers the Term, including any and all portions of renewal fees to
the extent covering the Term. Each Licensee shall pay or cause its
Subsidiaries to pay such fees in immediately available funds within thirty
(30) days of such Licensees receipt of an invoice therefor from Parent.
Parent agrees that after the Term, if Parent continues (in its sole
discretion) to maintain or renew any of the above domain names, Parent will
use such domain names solely to direct or redirect Internet traffic to an
inactive page.

SECTION 2.3 _No Modifications_. Each Licensee hereby acknowledges and agrees
that:

 

(a) Licensee shall not use the Licensed Marks other than as specified herein;

 

(b) Licensee shall not change, modify, or create any variation of the Licensed
Marks; and

 

(c) Licensee shall not join any trade, corporate or business names,
trademarks, tag-lines, identifying logos, monograms, slogans, service marks,
domain names, brand names, trade dress or any other names or source
identifiers (" _Source Indicators_ ") with the Licensed Marks so as to form a
composite or combined Source Indicator.

 



 

3 SECTION 2.4 _Limited License_. Each Licensee hereby acknowledges and agrees
that it has no right, title or interest, express or implied, in and to the
Licensed Marks, except as specifically provided herein and subject to the
terms and conditions stated in this Agreement. No license, either express or
implied, is granted by Parent to Licensees hereunder with respect to any
Source Indicator or otherwise, except as specifically stated herein.

ARTICLE III. _ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS_.

SECTION 3.1 _Transition_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that it
is essential for Licensees to transition from use of the Licensed Marks to
use of their own Source Indicators in a timely and expeditious manner after
the Effective Date. Thus, the Parties agree as follows:

 

(a) Each Licensee shall cease use of the Licensed Marks (the " _Termination
Date_ ") ( _i_ ) except as provided in (ii), on the earliest of ( _x_ ) 365
days after the Effective Date, ( _y_ ) the termination date specified in
_Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, or ( _z_ ) the date such Licensee
otherwise ceases all use of the Licensed Marks and ( _ii_ ) in the case of a
Licensee that is an Insurance Company, the earlier of ( _A_ ) the date that is
ninety (90) days after such Licensee receives a name change approval from a
Governmental Authority or ( _B_ ) the termination date specified in _Section
10.2_ or _Section 10.3_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Licensee
agrees to take all actions set forth on _Schedule B_ within the timeframes set
forth therein, which timeframes shall not be deemed to extend the Termination
Date. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , if a Licensee,
promptly after the Effective Date, makes all filings and takes all actions
required by any applicable governmental authorities to change its name to
names not including the Licensed Marks and so long as Licensee diligently
prosecutes such filings thereafter, if necessary, Parent shall agree to any
request by such Licensee to extend the Termination Date solely until such
name change has occurred. Each Licensee shall take all necessary actions, as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, to cease use of the Licensed
Marks and print and use new materials not bearing the Licensed Marks.

(b) Each category of materials that require approval by a Governmental
Authority shall be expeditiously assembled, submitted and diligently
prosecuted by the Licensees for approval in a timely fashion to allow for such
approval as soon as possible after the Effective Date, and in any event within
365 days of the Effective Date. The Licensees shall inform Parent promptly of
any Materials that require such approval and any problems encountered or
expected to be encountered in receiving required approvals from a Governmental
Authority prior to the end of the relevant time frames.

 

(c) Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Date, each Licensee
shall prepare and distribute a memorandum explaining the trademark
requirements under this Agreement (including _Schedule C_ ) to all of its
employees and shall post such memorandum on all Intranet sites directed at its
employees within fifteen Business Days after such Intranet sites
commence operation.



 

4 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than thirty
Business Days after the Effective Date, each Licensee shall prepare and
distribute a notice to its agents and subcontractors involved in the
production and distribution of each category of materials explaining the
trademark requirements under this Agreement (including  _Schedule C_ ).

(e) Each Party hereby designates the individual identified below as its
initial representative who possesses the necessary knowledge and expertise in
the matters referred to in this _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_ to oversee
the implementation of this Agreement. For Parent the initial representative
is [] (" _Parent Representative_ ") and for each Licensee the initial
representative is []. Each Party may replace such designated person by
providing notice of such replacement in accordance with _Section 11.2_ so
long as such replacement possesses the necessary knowledge and expertise.

 

SECTION 3.2 _Destruction of Materials_. Without limiting _Section 3.1(a)_, as
and when Licensee no longer uses a Licensed Mark, but no later than promptly
after the Termination Date as may be extended pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_,
each Licensee shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to destroy or
exhaust all materials (including signage, advertising, promotional materials,
software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials, website content,
collateral goods, business cards, invoices, receipts, forms, product, training
and service literature and materials and other materials) in its possession
or control bearing the Licensed Marks (" _Materials_ "), except to the extent
any such Materials must be retained to comply with applicable Laws or a
Licensees reasonable document retention policies.

 

SECTION 3.3 _Certification of Destruction_. As soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Termination Date, each Licensee shall send a written
statement to Parent verifying that it has complied with its obligations in
_Section 3.2_.

 

SECTION 3.4 _Obligation to Cease Use of the Mark_. Each Licensee acknowledges
that any prior rights it had to use any of the Licensed Marks pursuant to any
written or oral contract, agreement, license, sublicense or other instrument
executed or in effect prior to the Effective Date were terminated, effective
as of the Effective Date, pursuant to _Section 5.07_ of the Purchase
Agreement, and that it has no right to use any of the Licensed Marks after the
Effective Date, except expressly subject to this Agreement. Each Licensee
shall take all necessary actions to ensure that it ceases use of the
Licensed Marks by the Termination Date.

SECTION 3.5 _Representation in the Marketplace_. Except as expressly permitted
by this Agreement, each Licensee agrees that after the Effective Date it will
not expressly, or by implication, do business as or represent itself as Parent
or one of its Affiliates, and shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that
there is no confusion that it is no longer affiliated with Parent or its
Affiliates and/or, if any such confusion occurs, to promptly remediate same.

 

ARTICLE IV. _QUALITY STANDARDS_.

 

SECTION 4.1 _Quality Control and Standards_. Parent shall have the right to
exercise quality control over the use of the Licensed Marks by each Licensee
to the degree



 

5  reasonably necessary or desirable, in the sole opinion of Parent, to
maintain the validity and enforceability of the Licensed Marks, to protect the
goodwill associated therewith. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the
Term Parent may establish and amend ( _a_ ) quality standards and
specifications for the goods and services offered or provided by Licensees and
( _b_ ) the "Graphics Standards" for the use of the Licensed Marks, which are
attached hereto as _Schedule C_ , and in each case, communicate them to the
Licensees (subsections (a) and (b), together, the " _Quality Standards_ ").
Each Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it must comply with the Quality
Standards, which will be, at a minimum, set at a level of quality equal to the
standards of quality associated with the Licensed Marks as conducted prior to
the Effective Date. Each Licensee agrees to ( _x_ ) comply with all
applicable Laws in using the Licensed Marks, and ( _y_ ) identify to Parent
the actual legal entities providing the products or services in question
whenever Materials bearing the Licensed Marks are distributed to the public,
published or otherwise disseminated.

SECTION 4.2 _Samples_. Beginning on the Effective Date, each Licensee shall
submit to Parent Representative samples of all publicly-distributed Materials
using the Licensed Marks 15 Business Days prior to their initial distribution
if ( _i_ ) such Materials materially differ in their visual presentation of
the Licensed Marks from Materials previously distributed by such Licensee
prior to the Effective Date or approved by Parent before or after the
Effective Date or ( _ii_ ) such Licensee has any question whether its use of
the Licensed Marks on such Materials complies with its obligations hereunder.
In the event that Parent reasonably finds that such Materials deviate from the
Quality Standards or do not comply with any other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, or that, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, such publicly-
distributed Materials misuse the Licensed Marks or misrepresent the
relationship between Parent and Licensee, Licensee shall, upon notice from
Parent, at Parents option either ( _a_ ) promptly (or immediately in the
case of (1) any misrepresentation of the relationship between Parent and
Licensee, or (2) material deviation from the Quality Standards) take all
necessary actions to correct the deviations or misrepresentations in, or
misuse of, the respective items prior to any dissemination to the public, and
provide Parent with representative samples of the correction, or ( _b_ ) as
soon as practicable (or immediately in the case of (1) any misrepresentation
of the relationship between Parent and Licensee, or (2) material deviation
from the Quality Standards) cease dissemination of such Materials. If Licensee
fails to take such steps and nevertheless distributes such Materials, and
such distribution is likely to result in material harm to Parent, Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Licensee
pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.2_ hereof.

 

SECTION 4.3 _Record of Use_. Each Licensee shall maintain such reasonable
records of its use of the Licensed Marks as it maintained prior to the
Effective Date to assist Parent in protecting and enforcing them.

SECTION 4.4 _Quality Assurance_. Each Licensee shall comply with such other
reasonable requests as are made by Parent to enable Parent to assure the
quality of the relevant business conducted by Licensee and the goods and
services offered or provided by Licensee in connection with the Licensed
Marks.



 

6 ARTICLE V. _USE AND OWNERSHIP_.

 

SECTION 5.1 _Use of Licensed Marks_. Each Licensee shall use the Licensed
Marks in accordance with all applicable Laws. Each Licensee shall not use the
Licensed Marks in any manner that might dilute, tarnish, disparage, or reflect
adversely on Parent or the Licensed Marks.

 

SECTION 5.2 _Ownership of Licensed Marks_. Parent or its Affiliate owns and
has registered and maintained, in each case, in Japan, all of the Licensed
Marks and has not granted an exclusive license for any Licensed Mark in Japan,
pursuant to any other agreement. Each Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed
Marks and all rights therein and thereto and the goodwill pertaining thereto
belong exclusively to Parent. Each Licensees use of the Licensed Marks and
any and all goodwill generated thereby or associated therewith shall inure
solely to the benefit of Parent. After the Effective Date, if either
Party discovers that any Licensee owns or holds any registrations,
applications, reservations or other rights in any Licensed Mark or any other
Source Indicator containing the words or terms "AIG" or "American
International," it shall promptly notify the other Party, and such Licensee
shall promptly transfer same to Parent for no consideration.

 

SECTION 5.3 _No Confusion or Registration_. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 5.2_, each Licensee agrees and covenants that it shall not ( _a_ )
seek to register any Source Indicator that contains a Licensed Mark or is a
derivation, translation, adaptation, combination or variation of any Licensed
Mark that uses "AIG or American International" or that is otherwise
confusingly similar to any of the foregoing (a " _Similar Mark_ "), ( _b_ )
use a Similar Mark after the Term (or during the Term, except as expressly
permitted herein), ( _c_ ) directly or indirectly contest the ownership,
validity or enforceability of, or any rights of Parent or any of its
Affiliates in or to, any of the Licensed Marks, or ( _d_ ) contest the fact
that each Licensees rights under this Agreement are solely those of a non-
exclusive licensee and subject to all terms and conditions herein.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Statement_. Each Licensees Materials shall bear all notices and
legends required by applicable Law, and that were used by Parent or its
Affiliate in the ordinary course of business prior to the Effective Date, and
shall indicate in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent Representative that
use of the Licensed Marks is under license from Parent. The legal entity
statement set forth in _Schedule D_ shall be satisfactory for purposes of this
_Section 5.4_ for all publicly distributed Materials with reasonable
available space to display it or is otherwise reasonably feasible. Any
other such statement proposed to be used by each Licensee shall be submitted
to Parent Representative for prior written approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Each Licensee shall not use such license and legal
entity statement prior to such written approval.

SECTION 5.5 _Stuffer Letter_. Upon Parents request, each Licensee shall
include a "stuffer letter" with form and content to be reasonably agreed upon
between the Parties and in compliance with _Section 4.1_, with all Materials
bearing any of the Licensed Marks disseminated during the Term.

 



 

7 ARTICLE VI. _PROTECTION OF LICENSED MARKS; LITIGATION_.

 

SECTION 6.1 _Enforcement_. During the Term, Parent will have the sole right,
but not the obligation, to initiate any opposition, cancellation or
Infringement proceedings necessary to enforce the Licensed Marks. Parent shall
have the right but not the obligation to include Licensee as a party in any
such enforcement proceedings, and Licensee agrees to join in
such proceedings, at Parents expense, as a voluntary plaintiff or claimant,
and each Licensee shall cooperate fully with Parent in such proceedings, at
Parents expense. Parent shall have the sole right to control and settle any
such proceedings.

SECTION 6.2 _Recovery_. Any recovery obtained as a result of any action
pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be retained by Parent.

ARTICLE VII. _ASSIGNMENT_.

 

SECTION 7.1 _Assignment_. Except as provided herein, neither this Agreement
nor any right or obligation hereunder may be directly or indirectly assigned,
sublicensed, assumed in bankruptcy, pledged, mortgaged or transferred by any
Licensee in whole or in part, to any person or entity (including a bankruptcy
trustee), by operation of law or otherwise, whether voluntarily
or involuntarily, without Parents prior written consent in its sole
discretion, and any attempt to do so by any Licensee shall be null and void at
the outset and shall be a material breach of this Agreement, _provided that_
one or more Licensees may merge with each other without consent and the
surviving entity shall continue as a "Licensee" hereunder. For clarity, any
change of control, merger or reorganization shall be deemed an "assignment"
for purposes of this _Section 7.1_, regardless of whether a Licensee is the
surviving entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Licensee may assign any of
its rights or delegate any of its duties, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate
as of the Effective Date, provided that such Licensee shall notify Parent
thirty (30) days prior to such assignment.

SECTION 7.2 _Binding on Successors and Assigns_. In the event of a permitted
assignment, this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by the Parties, and their successors and
permitted assigns.

 

ARTICLE VIII. _REPRESENTATIONS; WARRANTY DISCLAIMER_.

 

SECTION 8.1 _Duly Authorized_. Each Party represents and warrants to the other
that it has duly authorized, executed and delivered this Agreement, which,
subject to the due execution and delivery hereof by the other Parties,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such person enforceable
against such person in accordance with its terms. Each Party represents and
warrants that it has the right and ability to perform the obligations and
covenants provided for herein in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.2 _DISCLAIMER_. THE LICENSED MARKS ARE LICENSED HEREUNDER "AS IS,"
AND PARENT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF DESIGN, QUALITY, VALUE, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OWNERSHIP, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. 



 

8 ARTICLE IX. _INDEMNIFICATION_.

 

SECTION 9.1 _Indemnification by Licensees_. Each Licensee hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Parent and its Subsidiaries harmless from and
against any Losses arising out of any third-Person claim as a result of or in
connection with ( _i_ ) the use of the Licensed Marks other than in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement; ( _ii_ ) the marketing, offering, use,
issuance, sale or performance of any materials, policies, goods or services
bearing the Licensed Marks or offered in connection with or under the Licensed
Marks, except for claims identified in  _Section 9.2_ below; ( _iii_ ) any
breach by such Licensee of this Agreement or any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein; or ( _iv_ ) such Licensees use of the mark
"Star" alone in connection with its business.

SECTION 9.2 _Indemnification by Parent_.

 

(a) Parent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Licensees harmless
from and against any Losses as a result of or in connection with any third-
Person claim ( _i_ ) that Licensees use of the Licensed Marks in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement infringes such third-Persons trademark
rights; or ( _ii_ ) is a result of or in connection with any breach by Parent
of this Agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
herein.

(b) Parent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Edison Licensees
harmless from and against any Losses as a result of or in connection with any
claim against them by General Electric Company to the extent that such claim
alleges that the Edison Sublicensees use of the "Licensed Edison Names and
Marks" (as defined in the Edison License) at any time prior to the earlier of
(i) the merger of the Edison Sublicensees into an Affiliate of Acquiror or
(ii) two (2) years from the Effective Date breaches the Edison License,
except to the extent that such use by the Edison Sublicensees is not in
compliance with the Edison License. The Edison Sublicensees hereby agree to
indemnify, defend and hold Parent and Sellers harmless from and against any
Losses as a result of or in connection with any claim by General Electric
Company to the extent such claim alleges that the Edison Sublicensees use of
the "Licensed Edison Names and Marks" (as defined in the Edison License)
otherwise breaches the Edison License ( _e.g._ , by use of the "Licensed
Edison Names and Marks" outside the scope of the grant in Section 2.1
therein).

 

SECTION 9.3 _Procedures_. An indemnified party under _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 9.2_ shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing in
reasonable detail of any potential indemnifiable claim, _provided_ , _however_
, that any failure to provide such notice shall not release the indemnifying
party from its obligations except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby.
Upon receiving such notice, the indemnifying party may, by notice to the
indemnified party within a reasonable time, assume the defense and control of
such claim, with its own counsel and at its own expense, but shall allow the
indemnified party a reasonable opportunity to participate with its own counsel
and at its own expense. The indemnified party may take any actions reasonably
necessary to defend such claim prior to receiving such notice. The indemnified
party shall



 

9  cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in its defense. Neither party
shall, without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld), admit liability in, consent to a settlement,
compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from any
indemnifiable claim that adversely affects the other party in any manner, and
the other party will have no liability for any Losses arising out of the
first partys violation of the foregoing.

ARTICLE X. _TERM AND TERMINATION_.

 

SECTION 10.1 _Term_. The term of this Agreement (the " _Term_ ") shall
commence on the Effective Date and shall last until the Termination Date (as
defined in _Section 3.1(a)_).

bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the
entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or
other similar official for it or for any substantial part of its property, and
in the case of any proceeding instituted against any Licensee, such
proceeding shall not be stayed or dismissed within 60 days from the date of

SECTION 11.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

SECTION 11.4 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between or on behalf of Parent, on the one hand, and the
Licensees, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of the Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

SECTION 11.5 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except that Sellers shall
have the right to enforce the provisions of _Section 9.1(b)_ directly against
the indemnifying parties therein.

 



 

11 SECTION 11.6 _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by
all the Parties. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

 

SECTION 11.7 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial;
Injunctive Relief_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to
any conflicts of law principles of such state that might refer the governance,
construction or interpretation of such agreements to the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the Parent and the Companies irrevocably and unconditionally:

 

(i) agrees that the other Parties may bring an Action arising out of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement in ( _A_ )
the Courts of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law,
jurisdiction is vested in the United States federal courts, any court of the
United States located in the State of Delaware, and ( _B_ ) the courts in
Japan;

(ii) acknowledges that money damages are an inadequate remedy for a breach
or anticipated breach of this Agreement and the difficulty of quantifying
such damages, and that, therefore, in such event, each of the other Party may,
in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an Action in the
courts set forth in  _Section 11.7(b)(i)_ to obtain a restraining order
and/or injunction or other relief to prohibit or remedy such violation,
without needing to secure or post bond or other security;

 

(iii) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the applicable
Parties at the addresses provided in _Section 11.2_; and

 

(iv) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PERSON MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the thirty (30)-day remedial period set forth in _Section
10.2_, if there is a dispute (" _Dispute_ ") as to whether a breach of this
Agreement has occurred, such Dispute shall be resolved pursuant to this
_Section 11.7(c)_. The non-breaching Party may

 



 

12  request discussion and negotiations between senior executives of each Party
with the possibility of mediation. In the event that the Parties have not been
able to resolve the Dispute to their mutual satisfaction within a period of
thirty (30) days, either Party may request in writing (an " _Escalation
Notice_ ") that the Dispute be escalated to the chief executive officers of
the respective Parties or to such other senior executives of the Parties as
their respective chief executive officers may delegate. The Parties and their
chief executive officers and other senior executives agree to use good faith
efforts to resolve any Dispute pertaining to whether a breach of this
Agreement has occurred. If the Dispute is not resolved by the chief executive
officers or other senior executives of the respective parties within thirty
(30) days following receipt of the Escalation Notice by the non-
requesting Party, the Parties may pursue remedies through litigation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may immediately seek preliminary or
temporary equitable or injunctive relief during the pendency of the foregoing
procedures pursuant to  _Section 11.7(b)_.

SECTION 11.8 _Obligations of Parties_. Each obligation of each Licensee under
this Agreement to take (or refrain from taking) any action hereunder shall be
deemed to include, with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary, an undertaking
by its owning Company, to cause such Transferred Subsidiary to take (or
refrain from taking) such action.

SECTION 11.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or other means of electronic transmission shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.10 _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree to take all further
actions, execute all further documents and otherwise cooperate in good faith
to further the intents and purposes of this Agreement. If either Party
discovers an error in a Schedule hereto, it shall notify the other Party, and
such Schedule shall be promptly corrected.

SECTION 11.11 _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this Agreement shall only become effective as of the Closing
and shall not become effective if the Closing does not occur.

 



 

13 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed by its duly authorized officer, in each case as of the date first
written above.

(which, for clarity, shall exclude the Company Parties and any former
Affiliates of Parent) (the " _Parent Parties_ "), hereby grants to the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Parties_
") a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, non-
transferable (except as set forth in _Section 6.1_) right and license under

all current and future policies, goods and services within the respective
businesses of the Parent Parties conducted as of the Effective Date.

 

SECTION 2.3 _Licensed Parent Software Grant_. Subject to the terms hereof,
Parent, on behalf of itself and the parties listed on _Schedule C_ , hereby
grants to the Company Parties a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, non-

such listed parties and ( _ii_ ) subsists in the Software listed on _Schedule

4 ARTICLE III. _ACKNOWLEDGMENTS._

 

SECTION 3.1 _Ownership_. Parent represents that it or its Affiliate owns and,
as applicable, has registered and maintained registrations for Licensed
Parent IP licensed pursuant to _Section_ _2.1(i)(a)_. The Parent Parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that, as between the Parties, the Company Parties
are the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title and interest in and to
the Licensed Company IP. The Company Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that, as between the Parties, the Parent Parties are the sole and exclusive
owners of all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Parent IP
and the Licensed Parent Software.

SECTION 3.2 _No Ownership Claim_. The Parent Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that none of them shall at any time, anywhere in the world: ( _i_ )
file any application to register, or otherwise claim ownership of, the
Licensed Company IP anywhere in the world or ( _ii_ ) challenge or contest the
validity, enforceability of or the Company Parties rights in the Licensed
Company IP. The Company Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that none of them
shall at any time, anywhere in the world: ( _i_ ) file any application to
register, or otherwise claim ownership of, the Licensed Parent IP or Licensed
Parent Software or ( _ii_ ) challenge or contest the validity, enforceability
of or the Parent Parties rights in the Licensed Parent IP or Licensed Parent

SECTION 3.3 _Ownership of Derivative Works_. If a Parent Party or Company
Party creates or invents any new Intellectual Property after the Effective
Date that is a modification, improvement or derivative work (a " _Derivative
Work_ ") of any Intellectual Property owned by the Other Parties, Additional
Joint IP or, with respect to the Company Parties, the Licensed Parent
Software, the Party creating or inventing such Derivative Work shall
exclusively own all rights in the new subject matter and shall have no
obligation to license it to the Other Parties.

 

ARTICLE IV. _ENFORCEMENT._

 

The owner of any Licensed IP (and the applicable Parent Parties, with respect
to the Licensed Parent Software) shall have the sole right, but not the
obligation, to challenge, attempt to eliminate and or bring an Action against
its infringement, misappropriation or other violation by a third party. In the
event that such owner decides to bring such an Action, the licensee
Parties hereunder shall reasonably cooperate, at the owners expense. All
proceeds recovered in such Action shall be retained solely by the owner.

 

ARTICLE V. _CONFIDENTIALITY._

 

SECTION 5.1 _Source Code_. The Company Parties acknowledge that the Source
Code is a trade secret, and agree to maintain the Source Code in the
strictest confidence. The Company Parties shall carefully restrict access to
the Source Code to a minimal number of employees (and contractors, subject to
a written agreement with legal duties at least as strict as those under this
Agreement to keep the Source Code in the strictest confidence) on a "need-to-
know" basis and shall otherwise protect its confidentiality with the same
degree of care as they would use for their own most valuable
confidential information. The Company Parties are liable hereunder for any
unauthorized disclosure of or access to any Source Code.



 

5 SECTION 5.2 _Confidential Information_.

 

(a) Without limiting _Section 5.1_, each of the Parent Parties and the
Company Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to,
maintain in confidence and not use or exploit for any purpose other than in
connection with fulfilling their respective obligations under this Agreement,
any written, oral or other information relating to or obtained from the other
Parties, respectively, except with respect to ( _i_ ) any such information
that is or becomes generally available to the public other than ( _A_ ) as a
result of disclosure by the applicable receiving Party, its Affiliates,
or any of its or any of their Representatives, ( _ii_ ) any such information
that is required by applicable Law, Governmental Order or a Governmental
Authority to be disclosed after notice has been given to the other Party as
soon as practicable (including any report, statement, testimony or other
submission to such Governmental Authority), ( _iii_ ) any such information
that is reasonably necessary to be disclosed in connection with any Action or
in any dispute with respect to this Agreement (including in response to any
summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal investigative
demand issued to the disclosing party), or ( _iv_ ) any such information was
or becomes available to such Party on a non-confidential basis and from a
source (other than a Party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) that
is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information.
Each Party shall instruct its Affiliates and Representatives having access to
such information of such obligation of confidentiality.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Parent Party may share any information relating
to or obtained from the other Parties with ( _i_ ) the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York or the U.S. Department of the Treasury and their respective
Representatives, ( _ii_ ) any insurance regulatory authority or ( _iii_ ) any
tax authority, in each case as the applicable Parent Party deems necessary or
advisable in its good faith judgment. 

(c) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, including the Act on
the Protection of Personal Information in Japan,  _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not
restrict or limit the use of or disclosure by the Parent Parties of any
customer, policy or beneficiary information relating to the Company Parties if
such information was in the possession or control of the Parent Parties prior
to the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall apply
regardless of whether such information ( _i_ ) was also possessed or
controlled by the Company Parties on or prior to the Effective Date and/or (
_ii_ ) was originated by any Company Parties.

SECTION 5.3 _Unauthorized Actions_. If, at any time, a Party becomes aware of
a breach or potential breach of _Section 5.1_ or _5.2_ , such Party shall
immediately notify the other Party and cooperate with any reasonable actions
to prevent or remedy any such breach.

 

ARTICLE VI. _ASSIGNMENT._

 

SECTION 6.1 _Assignment_.

 

(a) Except as permitted in _Section 2.5_ or _Section 6.1(b_), ( _c_ ) or (
_d_ ), neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder may be
directly or indirectly assigned, sublicensed, assumed in bankruptcy, pledged,
mortgaged or transferred by any Party, in whole or

 



 

6  in part, to any person or entity (including a bankruptcy trustee), by
operation of law or otherwise, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, without
the Other Parties prior written consent in their sole discretion, and any
attempt to do so shall be null and void at the outset and shall be a material
breach of this Agreement, _provided that_ one or more Company Parties may
merge with each other without consent and the surviving entity shall continue
as a "Company" hereunder. For clarity, any change of control, merger or
reorganization shall be deemed an "assignment" for purposes of this _Section
6.1_, regardless of whether a Company Party is the surviving entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Company Party may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate as of the
Effective Date, provided that such Company Party shall notify Parent thirty
(30) days prior to such assignment.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.1(a)_, if a Party (the " _Divesting Party_ ")
sells or divests (whether by asset sale or otherwise) a business unit or any
other portion of its business that is covered by one or more of the licenses
in _Section 2.1_, _2.2_ or _2.3_ (as either a licensee or benefiting Party
or a licensor or granting Party thereunder) (a " _Divested Business_ "), the
Divesting Party may sublicense or assign its applicable rights and obligations
hereunder to the acquiror or successor of such Divested Business, without
limiting the rights or obligations of the Divesting Party hereunder with
respect to its retained businesses, _provided that_ ( _i_ ) the acquiror or
successor must assume in writing all of the Divesting Partys applicable
obligations hereunder and ( _ii_ ) the benefits and burdens of the licenses
and covenants applying to the Divested Business shall continue to apply only
to such Divested Business and shall not extend to any separate or unrelated
Affiliates or businesses of its acquiror or successor. Any purported
transaction in violation of the foregoing shall be deemed null and void at the
outset. The Divesting Party is not liable to an Other Party hereunder for any
act or omission committed by the acquiror or successor of a Divested Business
with respect to such Divested Business.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 6.1(a)_, if a Divesting Party sells or divests
(whether by stock sale, merger, or otherwise) a Subsidiary that is covered by
one or more of the licenses in _Section 2.1_, _2.2_ or _2.3_ (as either a
licensee or benefiting Party or a licensor or granting Party thereunder) (a "
_Divested Subsidiary_ "), such Divested Subsidiary may retain its applicable
rights and obligations hereunder, without limiting the rights or obligations
of the Divesting Party hereunder with respect to its retained businesses,
_provided that_ the Divested Subsidiary must assume in writing all of the
Divesting Partys applicable obligations hereunder, and the benefits
and burdens of the licenses and covenants applying to the Divested Subsidiary
shall continue to apply only to such Divested Subsidiary and shall not extend
to any separate or unrelated Affiliates or businesses of its acquiror or
successor. Any purported transaction in violation of the foregoing shall be
deemed null and void at the outset. The Divesting Party is not liable to an
Other Party hereunder for any act or omission committed by a Divested
Subsidiary after the divestiture date.

 

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.1(a)_, if a Party (the " _Assigning Party_ ")
undergoes a merger, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of its
equity or assets, such Assigning Party may assign this Agreement to its
acquiror or successor, _provided that_ ( _i_ ) the acquiror or successor
assumes in writing all of the Assigning Partys obligations hereunder and (
_ii_ ) the rights and obligations under this Agreement shall cover only the
Assigning Partys business and shall not extend to any separate or unrelated
Affiliates or businesses of its acquiror or successor. Any purported
transaction in violation of the foregoing shall be deemed null and void at the
outset.



 

7 SECTION 6.2 _Binding on Successors and Assigns_. In the event of a
permitted assignment, this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Parties and their permitted
successors and assigns.

 

ARTICLE VII. _REPRESENTATIONS; DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY._

 

SECTION 7.1 _Duly Authorized_. Each Party represents and warrants to the other
that it has duly authorized, executed and delivered this Agreement, which,
subject to the due execution and delivery hereof by the other Parties,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such person enforceable
against such person in accordance with its terms. Each Party represents and
warrants that it has the right and ability to perform the obligations and
covenants provided for herein in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.2 _DISCLAIMER_. ALL LICENSED IP AND THE PARENT LICENSED SOFTWARE ARE
LICENSED HEREUNDER "AS IS," AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS HEREUNDER ANY
AND ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES
OF DESIGN, QUALITY, VALUE, FREEDOM FROM BUGS, ERRORS OR VIRUSES, OPERABILITY,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR USE OR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SUITABILITY, ANY
RESULTS DERIVED THEREFROM, OWNERSHIP, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF THIRD PARTIES.

 

SECTION 7.3 _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_. EXCEPT FOR A MATERIAL BREACH OF
_ARTICLE V_ , NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS
AND CLAIMS OF CUSTOMERS, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
THE SAME.

ARTICLE VIII. _INDEMNIFICATION._  

SECTION 8.1 _Indemnification_. Each party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other party and its affiliates and
its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisers and
representatives (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any
Losses resulting from or arising out of any claims or actions of third
parties based on or arising out of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.2 _Procedures_. An indemnified party under _Section 8.1_ shall
promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing in reasonable detail of any
potential indemnifiable claim, provided, however, that any failure to provide
such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligations
except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby. Upon receiving such notice,
the indemnifying party may, by notice to the indemnified party within a
reasonable time, assume the defense and control of such claim, with its own
counsel and at its

 



 

8  own expense, but shall allow the indemnified party a reasonable opportunity
to participate with its own counsel and at its own expense. The indemnified
party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such claim prior to
receiving such notice. The indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the
indemnifying party in its defense. Neither party shall, without the prior
written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), admit liability in, consent to a settlement, compromise or
discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from any indemnifiable
claim that adversely affects the other party in any manner, and the other
party will have no liability for any Losses arising out of the first partys
violation of the foregoing.

ARTICLE IX. _TERM AND TERMINATION._

SECTION 9.1 _Term_. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective
Date and lasts until Parent and each Company agree that the last item of
Licensed IP or the Licensed Parent Software is no longer protected by the
applicable intellectual property law. The Parties intend and agree that, in
the event of a breach of this Agreement, the aggrieved Party may seek all
available rights and remedies, except that this Agreement cannot be terminated
as a remedy.

 

SECTION 9.2 _Survival_. _Articles III_ , _V_ and _X_ and _Sections 7.2_ ,
_7.3_ and _9.2_ , of this Agreement shall survive the expiration of this
Agreement.

ARTICLE X. _MISCELLANEOUS._

SECTION 10.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

SECTION 10.3 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between or on behalf of the Parent, on the one hand, and
the Companies, on the other hand with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of the Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

SECTION 10.4 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except that any non-signatory
Parent Party or Company Party shall have the right to enforce its rights under
this Agreement directly against the applicable Parties.

SECTION 10.5 _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by
all the Parties. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.

SECTION 10.6  _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial; Injunctive Relief_.

(a) This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to
any conflicts of law principles of such state that might refer the governance,
construction or interpretation of such agreements to the Laws of another
jurisdiction.



 

10 (b) Each of the Parent and the Companies, on behalf of itself and the Parent
Parties and Company Parties, respectively, irrevocably and unconditionally:

(i) agrees that the Other Parties may bring an Action arising out of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement in ( _i_ )
the Courts of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law,
jurisdiction is vested in the United States federal courts, any court of the
United States located in the State of Delaware, ( _ii_ ) the courts in Japan,
and ( _iii_ ) for breaches of _Article V_ , in any other court of competent
jurisdiction;

 

(ii) acknowledges that money damages are an inadequate remedy for a breach or
anticipated breach of this Agreement (including _Article V_ ) and the
difficulty of quantifying such damages, and that, therefore, in such event,
each of the Other Parties may, in addition to any other remedies available to
it, bring an Action in the courts set forth in _Section 9.6(b)(i)_ to obtain
a restraining order and/or injunction or other relief to prohibit or remedy
such violation, without needing to secure or post bond or other security;

 

(iii) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the applicable
Parties at the addresses provided in _Section 10.1_; and

 

(iv) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PERSON MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

(c) If there is a dispute (" _Dispute_ ") as to whether a breach of this
Agreement has occurred, such Dispute shall be resolved pursuant to this
_Section 10.6(c)_. The non-breaching Party may request discussion and
negotiations between senior executives of each Party with the possibility of
mediation. In the event that the Parties have not been able to resolve the
Dispute to their mutual satisfaction within a period of thirty (30) days,
either Party may request in writing (an " _Escalation Notice_ ") that the
Dispute be escalated to the chief executive officers of the
respective Parties or to such other senior executives of the Parties as their
respective chief executive officers may delegate. The Parties and their chief
executive officers and other senior executives agree to use good faith efforts
to resolve any Dispute pertaining to whether a breach of this Agreement has
occurred. If the Dispute is not resolved by the chief executive officers or
other senior executives of the respective parties within thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Escalation Notice by the non-requesting Party, the
Parties may pursue remedies through litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Party may immediately seek preliminary or temporary equitable or
injunctive relief during the pendency of the foregoing procedures pursuant to
_Section 10.6(b)_.



 

11 SECTION 10.7 _Obligations of Parties_. Each obligation of Parent or each
Company under this Agreement to take (or refrain from taking) any action
hereunder shall be deemed to include an undertaking by the Party to cause the
other Parent Parties or the applicable Transferred Subsidiaries, respectively,
to take (or refrain from taking) such action. Subject to the provisions in
_Sections 6.1(b)_ and ( _c_ ) with respect to Divested Businesses and Divested
Subsidiaries, Parent and each Company is liable for any act or omission by the
other Parent Parties or its Transferred Subsidiaries, respectively, that
would breach this Agreement if committed by a Party hereto.

SECTION 10.8  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or other means of electronic transmission shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.9 _Bankruptcy_. The Parties intend and agree that the licenses in
_Section 2.1_, _2.2_ or _2.3_  shall be considered to be licenses to
"intellectual property" as defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §
101(35A), and that if a licensor Party hereunder enters into bankruptcy, the
licensee parties hereunder may fully exercise all of their rights and
remedies under 11 U.S.C. § 365(n) with respect thereto.

SECTION 10.10  _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree to take all further
actions, execute all further documents and otherwise cooperate in good faith
to further the intents and purposes of this Agreement. If either Party
discovers an error in a Schedule hereto, it shall promptly notify the other
Party, and such Schedule shall be promptly corrected.

SECTION 10.11  _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this Agreement shall only become effective as of the Closing
and shall not become effective if the Closing does not occur.

 



 

12 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed by its duly authorized officer, in each case as of the date first
written above.

     | Re: | Hold Harmless and Indemnification Under General Guarantee
Agreement 
---|---|--- 
 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Reference is hereby made to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
September 30, 2010 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), between American
International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ "), and
Prudential Financial, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the " _Acquiror_ ").
Capitalized terms used in this agreement (the " _Letter Agreement_ ") and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Purchase
Agreement.

 

Reference also is hereby made to (i) that certain general guarantee agreement,
dated as of August 29, 2003 (the " _AHA Guarantee Agreement_ "), made by
American Home Assurance Company (" _AHA_ ") on behalf of GE Edison Life
Insurance Company (as predecessor to AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, "
_Edison_ "), and (ii) that certain general guarantee agreement, dated as of
August 20, 2003 (the " _Lexington Guarantee Agreement_ ", and together with
the AHA Guarantee Agreement, the " _Guarantee Agreements_ "), made by
Lexington Insurance Company (" _Lexington_ ," and together with AHA, the "
_Guarantors_ ") on behalf of Edison, each of which Guarantee Agreements was
entered into for the benefit of certain parties insured under policies issued
by Edison. [ _Acquiror or Affiliate of Acquiror with Parent s Consent_]
hereby acknowledges that, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on the Closing Date
thereof, the Acquiror is required to cause to be delivered this Letter
Agreement to the Parent and the Guarantors.

In consideration of the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, (i) [ _Acquiror or Affiliate of Acquiror with
Parent s Consent_] (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") agrees, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Guarantors, against any Liability (as such term is defined below) incurred by
the Guarantors after the Closing Date arising under their respective
Guarantee Agreements (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), (ii) the Indemnifying
Party agrees, upon notice from any of the Companies, the Transferred
Subsidiaries, the Parent or any Guarantor, to promptly pay, in immediately
available funds, any and all Guaranteed Obligations, on behalf of the relevant
Guarantor and (iii) solely in the case of the AHA Guarantee, AHA agrees to
publish notice of termination of the AHA Guarantee Agreement as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, in accordance with the
terms of the AHA Guarantee Agreement. For the purposes hereof, " _Liability_ " shall mean any and all losses,
costs, claims, obligations, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
damages, penalties, fines, or other liabilities (whether known or unknown,
whether asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or contingent, accrued or
unaccrued, whether liquidated or unliquidated, and whether due or to become
due) arising under the Guarantee Agreements.

The liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Letter Agreement is
absolute, direct and immediate, not subject to set-off or counterclaim, and
not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against the
Indemnifying Party or any other person. All the terms and provisions of this
Letter Agreement are recourse obligations of the Indemnifying Party.

Upon payment of any obligations owing to any Guarantor, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to the rights of such Guarantor under the Guarantee
Agreement; and such Guarantor agrees to take, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, such steps as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request to
implement such subrogation.

In the event that the Indemnifying Party transfers, pledges or otherwise
disposes of all or substantially all its properties and assets (including
portfolio investments and capital stock of its Subsidiaries), whether in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to one or more Persons, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made prior to the
consummation of any such transaction so that each such Person shall assume the
obligations of the Indemnifying Party set forth in this Letter Agreement.

 

This Letter Agreement shall be binding on, and the term "Indemnifying Party,"
as used herein, shall include, the successors, assigns and other permitted
transferees of the Indemnifying Party. This Letter Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of the Guarantors and each of their respective successors, assigns
and other permitted transferees. The obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under this Letter Agreement shall be deemed to be continuing in nature and
shall remain in full force and effect and shall survive until there are no
longer any Guaranteed Obligations outstanding or contracted or committed
for under any Guarantee Agreement.

To the extent permitted by law, the Indemnifying Party hereby waives and
agrees not to assert or take advantage of any defense that may arise by
reason of any principle or provision of law, statutory or otherwise, which is
or might be in conflict with the terms and provisions of this Letter
Agreement. The Guarantors shall not be required to resort first to any other
Persons, their properties or estates, or to any collateral, property, liens or
other rights or remedies available to them, for indemnification as herein
contemplated.

 

This Letter Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties
respecting the matters herein set forth and supersedes all prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between the parties respecting such matters. Any
amendments or modifications hereto, to be effective, shall be in writing and
executed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this Letter Agreement shall not limit, reduce or otherwise
affect the validity or enforceability of the terms of any Guarantee Agreement.



 

F-2 This Letter Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to any conflicts of law principles of such state that might
refer the governance, construction or interpretation of this Letter Agreement
to the Laws of another jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally ( _i_ ) submits itself and its property in any Action
arising out of or relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Letter Agreement and of the documents referred to herein
and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Courts of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under
applicable Law, jurisdiction is vested in the United States federal courts,
the federal courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware; (
_ii_ ) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts
and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in any such court or that such Action was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to assert, plead or claim the
same; ( _iii_ ) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be
effected by mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail
(or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Party at
its address as provided hereinafter; and ( _iv_ ) agrees that nothing in this
Agreement shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other
manner permitted by the Laws of the State of New York.

All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications under this
Letter Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt) by delivery in person, by
overnight courier service, by facsimile with receipt confirmed (followed by
delivery of an original via overnight courier service) or by registered or
certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective
parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as
shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this paragraph):

The failure of any party hereto to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or
to promptly enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver
thereof nor give rise to any estoppel against such party nor excuse any of the
parties hereto from their respective obligations hereunder.

 

A separate right of action hereunder shall arise each time any Guarantor
acquires knowledge of any matter to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party
under this Letter Agreement. Separate and successive actions may be brought
hereunder to enforce any of the provisions hereof at any time and from time to
time.

 

EACH PARTY TO THIS LETTERAGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS LETTER AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
LETTER AGREEMENT.

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the terms or provisions of this Letter Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, without posting a bond or other
undertaking, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Letter Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to injunctive
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Letter Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court having
jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any
party may be entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Letter Agreement, no
party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim,
that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 

This Letter Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one



 

F-4  agreement, binding on all the parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Letter Agreement by facsimile or

[ _Signature Page  Provider Letter Agreement  [Provider]_] _EXHIBIT H_

 

DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION POLICY

 

SECTION 1\. DEFINITIONS.

For purposes of this Policy:

(1) " _Person_ " means any person who is or was a director, officer or
statutory auditor of [] (hereafter the "Company").

(2) " _Official Capacity_ " means:

 

(a) when used with respect to a director, the office of director in the
Company; and

 

(b) when used with respect to a person other than a director, the elective or
appointive office in the Company held by the officer or the employment or
agency relationship undertaken by the employee or agent on behalf of the
Company, but

 

(c) in both paragraphs (a) and (b) does not include service for any other
foreign or domestic company or any partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise except to
the extent such service was at the request of the Company.

 

(3) " _Proceeding_ " means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative,
investigative, or any appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding.

(4) " _Good Faith_ " means the Person acted in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the Person had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

SECTION 2\. STANDARD FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

 

The Company will indemnify a Person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a
named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding, by reason of the fact
that such Person was acting as a director or officer of the Company, against
expenses (including reasonable costs, disbursements and attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the Person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such Proceeding only if it is determined in accordance with
Section 6 that the Person conducted himself or herself in Good Faith.

 

SECTION 3\. PROHIBITED INDEMNIFICATION.

A Person may not be indemnified under Section 2 in respect of any Proceeding
in which final adjudication adverse to such Person establishes that his or her
acts or omissions:

 

(1) resulted in receipt of an improper personal benefit, regardless of whether
the benefit resulted from an action taken in the Persons Official Capacity;
or



 

H-1 (2) were in breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the Company. As used in
this subsection, breach of a Persons duty of loyalty means an act or
omission which that person knows or believes to be contrary to the best
interests of the Company or its shareholders in connection with a matter in
which he or she has a material conflict of interest; or

(3) were not in Good Faith or involved a knowing violation of law.

 

In addition, a Person may not be indemnified under Section 2 in respect of any
Proceeding if indemnifying such Person would result in a violation of law.

SECTION 4\. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF PROCEEDING.

 

The termination of a Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction,
or on a plea of no contest or its equivalent is not of itself
determinative that the Person did not meet the requirements set forth in
Section 2\.

SECTION 5\. INDEMNIFICATION FOR A PROCEEDING BY OR ON BEHALF OF COMPANY.

Upon satisfying the standard for indemnification under Section 2, if the
Proceeding was brought by or on behalf of the Company, the indemnification
will be limited to expenses (including reasonable costs, disbursements and
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by the Person in connection with the defense
or settlement of such Proceeding. In addition, indemnification under this
section is subject to any additional restrictions or limitations as required
by law or court order with respect to a Proceeding by or on behalf of
the Company.

SECTION 6\. DETERMINATION OF INDEMNIFICATION.

 

A determination that indemnification of a Person is proper, and the Person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2, or advancement
of expenses is appropriate pursuant to Section 7, must be made by the Chief
Legal Officer of the Company. In making any determination as to whether an
indemnification of a Person is proper, the Chief Legal Officer must first
consult with either the General Counsel of Prudential Financial, Inc. or the
Law Department of The Prudential Insurance Company of America, dependant upon
the following circumstances

 

(1) With respect to Persons that hold the title of either Chairman or
President of the Company or acts as the country president (i.e., the head of
the business in a given country) or its equivalent, or of higher rank, or if
the amount to be paid in indemnification to any Person exceeds the Japanese
yen equivalent of five hundred thousand dollars US ($ 500,000.00),
prior consultation with the General Counsel of Prudential Financial, Inc.; or

(2) With respect to all other determinations not required to be made pursuant
to (1) above, prior consultation with the Chief Legal Officer of the
International Law Department of The Prudential Insurance Company of America.

 

However, to the extent that a Person has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in the defense of a Proceeding, as described in Section 2
above, the Company will indemnify such Person against expenses (including
reasonable costs, disbursements and attorneys fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her in connection with such Proceeding without the
necessity of a determination as described in this Section 6\.



 

H-2 SECTION 7\. ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.

 

Reasonable expenses incurred by a Person defending or investigating a
Proceeding will be paid or reimbursed by the Company in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding (1) if it is more likely than not that
the Person will meet the standard for indemnification as set forth in Section
2, and (2) only after the Company receives a written undertaking by or on
behalf of the Person to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Policy; provided, however, the Person may be required to cooperate with
an investigation to be conducted at the Companys expense, by a law firm
selected by the law department, and that such law firm render an opinion that,
based on its investigation, the firm has concluded that it is more likely than
not that the Person will meet the standard for indemnification as set forth
in Section 2 in connection with the Proceeding for which advancements are
sought.

SECTION 8. CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Policy will,
unless otherwise provided when determined, continue as to a Person who has
ceased to hold his or her position as a director, officer or statutory
auditor, and, in the event of the death of such director, officer or statutory
auditor, will inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators.
