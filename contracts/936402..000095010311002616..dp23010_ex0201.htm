SECTION 1.3 Determination of Pro Rata Amounts Hereunder. For the purposes of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the pro rata portion of the General
Escrow Amount or the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Amount (or any
distribution from the General Escrow Account or the Equityholders'
Representative Escrow Account) attributed to any share of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock or any Company Option or Warrant shall be calculated based
upon the Iterative Process (and, if applicable, whether any additional Company
Options or Warrants would be "in-the-money") and (i) in the case of each share
of Common Stock and each share of Common Stock that is issuable upon the
exercise of a Company Option or a Common Warrant, the ratio (expressed as a
decimal) of (A) one, divided by (B) the number of shares of Fully-Diluted
Common Stock, (ii) in the case of each share of Preferred Stock, the ratio of
(A) the number of shares of Common Stock (which may be a fractional number)
into which such share of Preferred Stock is convertible, divided by (B) the
number of shares of Fully-Diluted Common Stock, and (iii) in the case of each
Warrant (other than a Common Warrant), the ratio of (A) the number of shares
of Common Stock (which may be a fractional number) into which the shares of
the applicable Preferred Stock (which may be a fractional number) issuable
upon exercise of such Warrants are convertible divided by (B) the number of
shares of Fully-Diluted Common Stock.

THE MERGER

  


 

  

SECTION 2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise
provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.2 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.3 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins
LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m. New York City time on
a date to be mutually agreed to by the Parties hereto, which date shall be no
later than three (3) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the
last of the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions
which, by their terms, are to be satisfied at the Closing), or at such other
location, time and date as the Parties hereto agree in writing (such date
hereinafter, the "Closing Date").

  


 

  

SECTION 2.4 Effective Time. Contemporaneously with or as promptly as
practicable after the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a properly executed
certificate of merger conforming to the requirements of the DGCL, executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of
Merger"), and shall make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective when the
Certificate of Merger is accepted for recording by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall
agree in writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

  


 

  

SECTION 2.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law; provided, that such certificate of incorporation shall
reflect as of the Effective Time "Advanced BioHealing, Inc." as the name of
the Surviving Corporation. The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a
director or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an
officer or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.6 Conversion of Securities; Treatment of Company Options and
Warrants. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or the holder of any
shares of Company Capital Stock:

  


 

  

 

(a) Conversion of Company Capital Stock. Subject to Section 3.2 and Section
3.3, (i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company ("Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant
to Section 2.6(b) and any shares of Common Stock which are held by Dissenting
Stockholders) shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Per-
Share Merger Consideration in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without
interest, (ii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company ("Series A Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock which are held by Dissenting Stockholders) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Series A Preferred Per-Share Merger
Consideration in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest, (iii)
each share of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company ("Series B Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and any shares of Series B Preferred Stock
which are held by Dissenting Stockholders) shall be converted into the right
to receive the Series B Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration in cash,
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, (iv) each share of Series C
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Series C
Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and any shares of Series C Preferred Stock which
are held by Dissenting Stockholders) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Series C Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, payable to the
holder thereof, without interest and (v) each share of Series C-1 Preferred
Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Series C-1 Preferred
Stock" and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred
Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, the "Preferred Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Series C-1 Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and any
shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock which are held by Dissenting
Stockholders) shall be converted into the right to receive the Series C-1
Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration in cash, payable to the holder
thereof, without interest. All such shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
(collectively, the "Company Capital Stock") shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable therefor. Certificates previously representing
shares of Company Capital Stock shall be exchanged for the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Certificates upon the
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.1.

   
 

  

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each share of Company Capital Stock held
by Parent, Merger Sub, any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or in the
treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

(c) Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger
Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only issued and outstanding
equity interests of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

 

(d) Treatment of Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and
appropriate to provide that, at the Effective Time, each unexpired and
unexercised Company Option shall become fully vested and exercisable and shall
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of
such cancellation, payments in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or
other Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Option multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the Option In-The-Money
Amount, calculated as of the Effective Time and recalculated, if applicable,
in connection with any recalculation of the Common Merger Consideration,
exceeds the exercise price of such Company Option (for the avoidance of doubt,
without duplication of any amounts previously paid to holders of such Company
Options in accordance herewith). Any such amount payable hereunder with
respect to any Company Option shall be referred to as an "Option Payment", and
the aggregate of all such amounts payable hereunder shall be referred to as
the "Option Payments". At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will make
available to the Surviving Corporation the cash to be delivered in respect of
the Option Payments based on the calculation of the Common Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time (the "Closing Option Payments"). Option
Payments following the Effective Time shall be made on or about the same
dates, and subject to the same terms, as payments of the Merger Consideration
to the holders of Company Capital Stock. Any Company Options shall no longer
be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such
holder to the payment of the applicable Option Payments in accordance with
this Section 2.6(d), which for the avoidance of doubt includes the right to
receive payments in connection with any Excess Payment or any release of funds
from the General Escrow Account or the Equityholders' Representative Escrow
Account. At the Effective Time, all Company Option Plans shall be terminated
and no further Company Options shall be granted thereunder. The Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of Company Options to
enter into a written agreement effectuating the foregoing, and the payment of
the Option Payment to each holder of Company Options shall be subject to such
holder's execution and delivery of such agreement in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D (such agreement, an "Option Holder Letter").

  

 

  

 

(e) Treatment of Warrants. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, at the Effective Time, (i) each
unexpired and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (the
"Common Warrants") pursuant to a contract or agreement to which the Company is
a party shall, immediately prior to its termination in accordance with its
terms at the Closing, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled Common Warrant shall be converted into a right to
receive, in consideration of such cancellation, (a) a payment in cash (subject
to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld) in an amount equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares
of Common Stock subject to such Common Warrant multiplied by (2) the Common
Per-Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of Common
Stock subject to such Common Warrant (any such amount payable hereunder with
respect to any such Common Warrant being referred to as a "Common Warrant
Payment", and the aggregate of all such amounts payable hereunder being
referred to as the "Common Warrant Payments"), and (b) the right to receive
payments from the General Escrow Account and the Equityholders' Representative
Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3, (ii)
each unexpired and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (the "Series B Warrants") pursuant to a contract or agreement
to which the Company is a party shall, immediately prior to its termination in
accordance with 
 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

its terms at the Closing, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled Series B Warrant shall be converted into a right
to receive, in consideration of such cancellation, (a) a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law to be withheld) in an amount equal to the product of (1) the total number
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to such Series B Warrant
multiplied by (2) the Series B Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration less
the exercise price per share of Series B Preferred Stock subject to such
Series B Warrant (any such amount payable hereunder with respect to any such
Series B Warrant being referred to as a "Series B Warrant Payment", and the
aggregate of all such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
"Series B Warrant Payments"), and (b) the right to receive payments from the
General Escrow Account and the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3, (iii) each unexpired and
unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the
"Series C Warrants") pursuant to a contract or agreement to which the Company
is a party shall, immediately prior to its termination in accordance with its
terms at the Closing, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled Series C Warrant shall be converted into a right
to receive, in consideration of such cancellation, (a) a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law to be withheld) in an amount equal to the product of (1) the total number
of shares of Series C Preferred Stock subject to such Series C Warrant
multiplied by (2) the Series C Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration less
the exercise price per share of Series C Preferred Stock subject to such
Series C Warrant (any such amount payable hereunder with respect to any such
Series C Warrant being referred to as a "Series C Warrant Payment", and the
aggregate of all such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
"Series C Warrant Payments"), and (b) the right to receive payments from the
General Escrow Account and the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3, and (iv) each unexpired
and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock (the
"Series C-1 Warrants" and, together with the Common Warrants, the Series B
Warrants and the Series C Warrants, the "Warrants") pursuant to a contract or
agreement to which the Company is a party shall, immediately prior to its
termination in accordance with its terms at the Closing, be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Series C-1 Warrant
shall be converted into a right to receive, in consideration of such
cancellation, (a) a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or
other Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld) in an amount equal to
the product of (1) the total number of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock
subject to such Series C-1 Warrant multiplied by (2) the Series C-1 Preferred
Per-Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of Series C-1
Preferred Stock subject to such Series C-1 Warrant (any such amount payable
hereunder with respect to any such Series C-1 Warrant being referred to as a
"Series C-1 Warrant Payment", and the aggregate of all such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the "Series C-1 Warrant Payments" and, together
with the Common Warrant Payments, the Series B Warrant Payments and the Series
C Warrant Payments, the "Warrant Payments"), and (b) the right to receive
payments from the General Escrow Account and the Equityholders' Representative
Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3. All
such Warrants shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Warrants shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Warrant Payment payable therefor
and the right to receive payments from the General Escrow Account and the
Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement and Section 3.3. Certificates previously representing Warrants shall
be exchanged for the Warrant Payment payable in respect of such Certificates,
without interest, upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.1.

SECTION 2.7 Total Cash Equity Price Adjustments

 

  

  

(a) Estimated Closing Statement. The Company shall deliver to Parent, no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, a statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth good faith estimates of (i) the Working
Capital and Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, (ii) the Indebtedness of the
Company on the Closing Date but immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing
Date Indebtedness"), (iii) the Cash Equivalents on hand at the Company on the
Closing Date but immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Date Cash"),
(iv) the Company Transaction Expenses, (v) the Estimated Balance Sheet and
(vi) the Estimated Total Cash Equity Price. For the avoidance of doubt, these
estimates (and the calculations resulting therefrom) shall take into account,
(x) in the case of and as a reduction to Closing Date Cash, the payment in
cash of the Company Transaction Expenses and the Management Retention Bonuses,
at or prior to Closing, as contemplated by Section 2.8 and (y) in the case of
the Working Capital, an accrual for the aggregate Pro-Rata Bonuses to be paid
by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing in accordance with Section 2.8.
The estimates of Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date
Cash provided in the Estimated Closing Statement are referred to herein as the
"Estimated Working Capital", the "Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness" and the
"Estimated Closing Date Cash", respectively. The Company shall also deliver to
Parent (1) its calculations of the following (each determined in accordance
with the definitions thereof as of the Closing and based on the Estimated
Total Cash Equity Price): Common Merger Consideration, Common Per-Share Merger
Consideration, Fully-Diluted Common Stock, Merger Consideration, Option In-the
Money Amount, Common Warrant In-the-Money Amount, Series B Warrant In-the-
Money Amount, Series C Warrant In-the-Money Amount, Series C-1 Warrant In-the-
Money Amount, Series A Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, Series B
Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, Series C Preferred Per-Share Merger
Consideration, Series C-1 Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, Total
Common Merger Consideration, Total Series A Preferred Merger Consideration,
Total Series A Preferred Merger Preference, Total Series B Preferred Merger
Consideration, Total Series B Preferred Merger Preference, Total Series C
Preferred Merger Consideration, Total Series C Preferred Merger Preference,
Total Series C-1 Preferred Merger Consideration and Total Series C-1 Preferred
Merger Preference and (2) a detailed schedule setting forth (A) the name of
each Equityholder, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock,
Options and Warrants held by each such Equityholder, and (C) based on the
calculations described above, the portion of the Merger Consideration, Option
Payments and Warrant Payments to be received by each such Equityholder.

  

 

  

(b) Closing Statements. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Parent will prepare and deliver to the Equityholders' Representative an
unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing (the "Closing Balance
Sheet"), together with a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the
Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash and the
Adjustment Amount, in each case, as reflected on and derived from the Closing
Balance Sheet, and the Total Cash Equity Price. The Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same
applicable accounting methods, accounting practices, assumptions, policies and
methodologies as were used in preparing the Company Financial Statements.
Section 2.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an example of the
calculation of the Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date
Cash as of June 30, 2011. The Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness,
Closing Date Cash and Adjustment Amount set forth on the Closing Working
Capital Statement shall be derived from the Closing Balance Sheet using the
same applicable accounting methods, accounting practices, assumptions,
policies and methodologies as were used in the calculation set forth on
Section 2. 7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In the event Parent does not
deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement to the Equityholders'
Representative within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the
Estimated Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed to be
final and binding on the Parties and the Estimated Closing Statement shall be
deemed to be the Final Closing Statement for all purposes hereunder.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

(c) Notice of Disagreement. The Closing Statement shall become final and
binding upon the Parties on the date (the "Final Settlement Date") that is
forty-five (45) days following receipt thereof by the Equityholders'
Representative unless the Equityholders' Representative gives written notice
of its disagreement ("Notice of Disagreement") to Parent prior to such date.
Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar
amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted and any portion of
the Closing Statement not subject to any disagreement shall be deemed to be
final as set forth in the Closing Statement. If a Notice of Disagreement is
received by Parent in a timely manner, then the Closing Statement (as revised
in accordance with Section 2.7(d) below, if applicable) shall become final and
binding on the Parties on, and the Final Settlement Date shall be, the earlier
of (i) the date upon which the Equityholders' Representative and Parent agree
in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
and (ii) the date upon which the Final Closing Statement is issued by the
Arbitrator.

  

  

(d) Final Closing Statement. During the first twenty (20) days following the
date upon which Parent receives a Notice of Disagreement, the Equityholders'
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such twenty (20) day period (or
earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate) Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative have not reached agreement on such matters, the matters that
remain in dispute may be submitted to Grant Thornton LLP (the "Arbitrator") by
either Party for review and resolution. If Grant Thornton LLP is unable to
serve as the "Arbitrator" hereunder, the Arbitrator shall be a internationally
recognized independent public accounting firm agreed upon by Parent and the

Parent and the Equityholders' Representative shall each prepare and submit a
presentation to the Arbitrator. As soon as practicable (but in no event more
than thirty (30) days) thereafter, the Arbitrator shall determine the amount
of each item in dispute and prepare a Final Closing Statement and calculation

the Arbitrator's review pursuant to this Section 2.7(d), without right of
reimbursement from such other Party; provided, that such costs, fees and
expenses of the Equityholders' Representative (up to a maximum of one million
dollars ($1,000,000)), including any amounts payable to the Arbitrator out of
the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account pursuant to the previous
sentence) shall be paid out of the Equityholders' Representative Escrow

(e) Final Settlement and Adjustment to Total Cash Equity Price.

  


 

  

(i) (A) If the Adjustment Amount as derived from the Final Closing Statement
is a negative number, then the Total Cash Equity Price shall be decreased by
an amount, not to exceed the amount held in the General Escrow Account, equal
to such Adjustment Amount as derived from the Final Closing Statement
("Shortfall Reduction") and (B) if the Adjustment Amount as derived from the
Final Closing Statement is a positive number, then the Total Cash Equity Price
shall be increased by an amount equal to such Adjustment Amount ("Excess
Payment").

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(ii) Any Shortfall Reduction or Excess Payment described in clause (A) or (B)
in Section 2.7(e)(i) shall be paid not later than three (3) Business Days
after the Final Settlement Date (1) in the case of an Excess Payment, by
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent
to be added to the Exchange Fund for the benefit of, and to be distributed to,
the Equityholders in accordance with Section 3.1, or (2) in the case of a
Shortfall Reduction, out of the General Escrow Account by the Equityholders'
Representative and Parent sending a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to disburse funds in the amount of the Shortfall Reduction out of the
General Escrow Account to Parent; provided, that the amount of any such
payment shall not exceed the General Escrow Amount.

 

  


 

  

 

(f) Cooperation. For the purposes of complying with the terms set forth in
this Section 2.7, each Party shall cooperate with and make available to the
other Parties and their respective representatives all information, records,
data and working papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and
personnel, as may reasonably be required in connection with the preparation
and analysis of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement and the
resolution of any disputes related thereto.

 

  


 

  

(g) Adjustment to Total Cash Equity Price. Any Shortfall Reduction payable
pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Total
Cash Equity Price.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.8 Payment of Company Transaction Expenses; Pro-Rata Bonuses. At or
prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay (x) the Company Transaction
Expenses and (y) the Management Retention Bonuses to each Company Employee
eligible under the Management Retention Bonus Plan, as determined in
accordance with the Management Retention Bonus Plan by the Company. Within
five (5) Business Days after Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to
each Company Employee eligible to receive an annual bonus pursuant to the
Annual Bonus Program a pro-rata annual bonus ("Pro-Rata Bonus") in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the Company Employee's target annual bonus under
the Annual Bonus Program with respect to the fiscal year in which the Closing
occurs and (ii) the ratio of (A) the number of days elapsed during the period
beginning on the first day of the Company's fiscal year in which the Closing
occurs and ending on the Closing Date to (B) 365.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.9 Calculations and Iterative Process.

  


 

  

(a) Section 2.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth for illustrative
purposes a sample calculation of the allocation of the Merger Consideration,
Option Payments and Warrant Payments among the Equityholders that gives effect
to the provisions of this Agreement based on the assumptions set forth
therein. Such calculation shall use an iterative process (the "Iterative
Process") to determine which Company Options and Warrants are "in-the-money"
based on the applicable exercise price of the Company Options and Warrants in
conjunction with the calculation of the following amounts and definitions:
Common Merger Consideration, Common Per-Share Merger Consideration, Fully-
Diluted Common Stock, Merger Consideration, Option In-the-Money Amount, Common
Warrant In-the-Money Amount, Series B Warrant In-the-Money Amount, Series C
Warrant In-the-Money Amount, Series C-1 Warrant In-the-Money Amount, Series A
Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, Series B Preferred Per-Share Merger
Consideration, Series C Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, Series C-1
Preferred Per-Share Merger Consideration, Total Common Merger Consideration,
Total Series A Preferred Merger Consideration, Total Series A Preferred Merger
Preference, Total Series B Preferred Merger Consideration, Total Series B
Preferred Merger Preference, Total Series C Preferred Merger Consideration,
Total Series C Preferred Merger Preference, Total Series C-1 Preferred Merger
Consideration, and Total Series C-1 Preferred Merger Preference.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amounts payable by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation under this Agreement in respect of Company Capital
Stock, Company Options and Warrants shall equal (and not exceed) the Estimated
Total Cash Equity Price plus any Excess Payment plus funds released from time
to time from the General Escrow Account or the Equityholders' Representative
Escrow Account to the Equityholders.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III. 
 

  

EXCHANGE OF COMPANY CERTIFICATES

  


 

  

SECTION 3.1 Exchange of Company Certificates.

  


 

  

 

(a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, and subject to Section
3.1(c), Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, (i) with
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or another bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and Warrants,
cash in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the Estimated Total Cash Equity
Price less an amount equal to the Closing Option Payments (such cash, together
with any Excess Payment (and interest thereon) being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"), (ii) with the Escrow Agent, the General Escrow Amount
to the General Escrow Account and the Equityholders' Representative Escrow
Amount to the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account, and (iii) with the
Surviving Corporation, the amount equal to the Closing Option Payments. The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from the Company,
deliver the Merger Consideration and the Warrant Payments contemplated to be
paid pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of, Section 2.6 and this
Article III out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. Notwithstanding anything else in Article II or this Article
III to the contrary, payment of Merger Consideration and the Warrant Payments
may be made in installments as necessary to take into account any adjustments
to the Total Cash Equity Price pursuant to Section 2.7, and any Excess
Payment.

   
 

  

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. Subject to Section 3.1(c), promptly following the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days following the
Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or
Warrants (the "Certificates") (A) a letter of transmittal substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C ("Letter of Transmittal"), which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Equityholders' Representative, and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the portion of the
Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment (as applicable) receivable in respect
of such Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration or Warrant
Payment (as applicable) which such holder has the right to receive in respect
of the shares of Company Capital Stock or Warrants formerly represented by
such Certificate (and the right to receive payments from the General Escrow
Account and the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Following any receipt of an Excess Payment, the
Exchange Agent will deliver to each holder of surrendered Certificates, such
holder's pro rata portion thereof; provided, that if the Exchange Agent
receives an Excess Payment prior to receipt of surrendered Certificates, then
payment of the portion thereof applicable to such unsurrendered Certificates
shall be made at the same time as payment of the balance of the applicable
Merger Consideration or Warrant 
 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

 

Payment (as applicable) upon surrender thereof. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment (as applicable) payable
to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Capital Stock or Warrants that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the portion of the Merger Consideration or Warrant
Payment (as applicable) payable in respect of such shares of Company Capital
Stock or Warrants may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Capital Stock or Warrants is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by any documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.1, each Certificate shall, subject to Section 3.2, be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the portion of the Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment (as
applicable) payable in respect of such Certificate as set forth in Section
2.6.

   
 

  

 

(c) Exchange at Closing. Notwithstanding Section 3.1(b), each holder of a
Certificate, upon surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent at the Closing
together with a Letter of Transmittal (properly completed and duly executed)
and any other required documents of transfer, and provided such holder has
provided Parent and the Exchange Agent with at least five (5) Business Days'
written notice of its intention to so surrender its Certificates, shall be
entitled to receive at or immediately after the Closing in exchange therefor
the portion of the Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment (as applicable)
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company
Capital Stock or Warrants formerly represented by such Certificates (and shall
also be entitled to the right to receive payments from the General Escrow
Account and the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3). Promptly following such surrender,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver the portion of the Merger Consideration or
Warrant Payment (as applicable) payable out of the Exchange Fund in respect of
such surrendered Certificates.

   
 

  

 

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock and Warrants as
of the earlier to occur of (i) one (1) month after the Final Settlement Date
and (ii) one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any holders of Company Capital Stock and Warrants who have
not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration or Warrant Payments.

   
 

  

(e) No Liability. No Party shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock or Warrants for any cash from the Exchange Fund or other amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  


 

  

 

(f) Lost or Missing Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed or shall otherwise be missing, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen, destroyed or missing and, if required by Parent, the execution and
delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement against any claim that may
be made against the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate in
customary form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Exchange
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, destroyed or missing
Certificate, the portion of the Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment (as
applicable) payable in respect of such lost, stolen, destroyed or missing
Certificate (and such Person shall have the right to receive payments from the
General Escrow Account and the Equityholders' Representative Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 3.3).

   
 

  

(g) Withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to any holder of Company Capital
Stock, Company Options or Warrants such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct
and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Exchange Agent or the
Escrow Agent and timely paid over to the applicable Government Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Warrants
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.2 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the "fair
value" of such Dissenting Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock, as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Capital Stock
shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive any
portion of the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this Section 3.2)
and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the fair
value of such shares of Company Capital Stock, in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses the right to
dissent. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of fair value of
a Dissenting Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock and the Company
shall give Parent notice thereof and Parent shall have the right to
participate at its own expense in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost
the right to dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, the shares of Company Capital Stock held by such
Dissenting Stockholder shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.6.

  

  

SECTION 3.3 Escrow. The General Escrow Amount shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent at or prior to the Effective Time to be held in escrow as security for
the payment of any Shortfall Reduction under Section 2.7(e) and
indemnification claims under Article IX pursuant to the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement. The Equityholders' Representative Escrow Amount delivered to
the Escrow Agent shall be deposited in a separate account (the "Equityholders'
Representative Escrow Account") to be held in escrow to fund the out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of the Equityholders' Representative pursuant to the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Within five (5) Business Days of the
Escrow Termination Date, except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement
with respect to outstanding claims and the Investment Income Tax Amount (as
defined in the Escrow Agreement), each of Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the holders of Company Capital
Stock and Warrants and to the Surviving Corporation (for distribution of
Option Payments to the holders of Company Options) their respective pro rata
portions of the balance of the Escrow Amount, together with any earnings
thereon pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, less any amounts owing to the
Equityholders' Representative.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Capital Stock;
Closing of Company Transfer Books. At and after the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights as a
stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company
Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.6(b)),
the right to surrender his or her Certificate in exchange for payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration or, in the case of a Dissenting Stockholder,
to perfect his or her right to receive payment for his or her shares of
Company Capital Stock pursuant to the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of Company Capital
Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided for in this Agreement.

Laws affecting creditors' rights and relief of debtors generally and (ii) the
effect of rules of Law and general principles of equity, including rules of

access to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and (ii)

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent

shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Company shall make or cause to be made the registrations, declarations and

with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as

SECTION 6.5 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  


 

  

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer and employee of the Company (collectively, the
"Company Indemnified Parties") against any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by any of the Company Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Liabilities or any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under applicable Law and under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, to indemnify such Company Indemnified Parties and (ii) advance
reasonable expenses of counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation) as incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in connection with
any matters for which such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification from Parent pursuant to this Section 6.5(a) to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Company Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and all
rights of appeal have lapsed that such Company Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under applicable Law, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws, and pursuant to this Section 6.5(a); and
provided further that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay expenses of more than one counsel for all Company Indemnified
Parties in any single Action unless a conflict of interest precludes the
effective representation of more than one Company Indemnified Party with
respect to such Action.

   
 

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation for itself to maintain, in
effect a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering those
persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy (copies of which have been heretofore made
available to Parent or its advisors) with coverage in amount and scope at
least as favorable as the Company's existing coverage; provided, however, that
this Section 6.5(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy
or

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been obtained by the Company which
policy or policies provide such directors and officers with the coverage
described in this Section 6.5(b) for an aggregate period of not less than six
(6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Closing Date, including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) The terms and provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified Parties
by applicable Law, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended third
party beneficiary of this Section 6.5.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.6 Employee Benefit Matters.

  


 

  

 

(a) Not more than ten (10) and not less than five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with an updated version of
Section 4.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall reflect any
terminations of employment, new employee hires or changes to the employee
information otherwise contained therein. All Company Employees who are
employed by the Company immediately preceding the Closing, including those on
vacation and authorized leave of absence (including, without limitation,
family medical leave, military leave, sick leave, and short-term disability
leave), will remain employed immediately following the Closing (such
employees, the "Continuing Employees"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed as an obligation of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue the employment of a Company Employee for any
period following the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 6.6(e), from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor, pay,
perform and satisfy any and all Liabilities, obligations and responsibilities
to or in respect of all Company Employees arising under the terms of each
Company Benefit Plan, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
for as long as such Company Benefit Plan is in effect.

  

  

(c) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Effective Time
(the "Benefits Continuation Period"), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each Continuing Employee with (i) base
salary (or base wages) no less favorable than the base salary (or base wages)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) bonus or incentive opportunities (other than equity-based compensation)
that are no less favorable than the bonus or incentive opportunities (other
than equity-based compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, for the purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause each Continuing Employee to
receive service credit for service with the Company to the same extent such
service credit was granted under the Company Benefit Plans (other than for the
purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan) immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Company Employees (and any dependents or beneficiaries thereof) under any
welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time, 
 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

 

  other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with
respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective
Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all vacation,
personal and sick days accrued by Company Employees under the plans, policies,
programs and arrangements of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time.  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Equityholders' Representative acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Section 6.6 are included for the sole benefit of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement, (ii) shall limit the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement following the Effective Time, or (iii) shall
confer upon the Equityholders' Representative, or upon any other Person who is
not a party to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
Equityholder, any current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company, or any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent
or beneficiary thereof)), any right to continued or resumed employment or
recall, any right to compensation or benefits, or any third party beneficiary
or other right of any kind or nature whatsoever.

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall not make
or change any material Tax election, change any annual tax accounting period,
adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file any material amended Tax
Returns or claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any material closing
agreement, surrender any material Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender
any right to claim any material Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax
liability or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period
applicable to any Tax claim or assessment without Parent's written consent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  


 

  

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Merger (including any real property transfer tax and
any similar tax) shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company when due,
and Parent and the Company shall, sharing expenses equally, file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such taxes and fees,
and, if required by applicable Law, the Company shall join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  


 

  

(c) From the Effective Time until the Escrow Termination Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause the Company not to, amend any Tax Return of the Company
or file any claim for refund of Taxes paid by the Company for any Tax period
that ends on or before, or that includes, the Closing Date, other than any
amended Tax Return or claim for a refund, in each case, arising as a result of
a carryback of losses, credits or other similar tax items, without the prior
written consent of the Equityholders' Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that, if Parent agrees to waive
any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 that may result from the
filing of an amended Tax Return or claim for refund, such consent shall not be
required.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

49

endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend,
any Alternative Proposal, (iv) execute or enter into, any letter of intent,

Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") requesting that the SEC consent
to the immediate withdrawal of the Form S-1 together with all exhibits and
amendments thereto and (B) from the date hereof, it shall not take any action
(including without limitation any preparation in connection therewith and any
filing in furtherance thereof) to register itself or any of its securities
under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  

  

(b) "Alternative Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer made by any
Person for (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,

(a) To the extent that (i) any current or former officer, employee or service
provider of the Company would be entitled to any payment or benefit as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) such
payment or benefit would or could potentially constitute a "parachute payment"

(i) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
binding written waiver by such officer, employee or service provider (each, an
"Excess Parachute Waiver") of any portion of such parachute payment as exceeds
2.99 times such individual's "base amount" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code (collectively, the "Excess Parachute Payments") to the
extent such excess is not subsequently approved pursuant to a stockholder vote
in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement
before it is mailed to the holders of Company Capital Stock (other than the
Principal Stockholders), and the Company shall not permit the Information
Statement to be distributed without Parent's prior written approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that Parent
shall in no way be responsible for any of the content of the Information
Statement except for information supplied in writing by Parent expressly for

Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time; provided, that the Company
shall not distribute any correspondence relating to such consents, waivers or

respect, in either case, such that the condition specified in Section 7.2(a)
hereof would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Company Breach"),
except that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company

occurring prior to such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(a) Effective at and after the Effective Time, the Equityholders, severally
and not jointly, hereby indemnify Parent, its Affiliates and their respective

duplication, the Company and its successors and assignees (collectively, the
"Parent Indemnified Parties") against and agree to hold each of them harmless
from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by Parent or any other Parent
Indemnified Party arising out of (i) any misrepresentation or breach of

4.8(a) and Section 4.9(a), without regard to any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any

agreement made or to be performed by the Company or the Equityholders'
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) any claim by any current or
former holder of any security of the Company, in its capacity as such,

calculation of Working Capital and (vi) any Management Retention Bonuses to
the extent not paid by the Company at or prior to the Closing and not included

Breaches, the Equityholders shall not be liable unless (x) the amount of
Damages with respect to such Warranty Breach arising from a single claim (or
series of related claims) exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and
(y) the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches
exceeds five million six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars ($5,625,000)
(the "Threshold") and then for the full amount of such Damages and (B) the
Equityholders' aggregate maximum liability pursuant to this Section 9.2(a)
shall not exceed the then-remaining General Escrow Amount.

   
 

  

 

(b) Effective at and after the Effective Time, Parent hereby indemnifies the
Equityholders, their Affiliates and their respective successors and assignees
(collectively, the "Equityholder Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
the Equityholder Indemnified Party arising out of (i) any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty (determined without regard to any qualification or
exception contained therein relating to materiality or material adverse effect
or any similar qualification or standard) of Parent or Merger Sub (each such
misrepresentation and breach of warranty a "Parent Warranty Breach") or (ii)
any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that (A) with respect to
indemnification for Parent Warranty Breaches pursuant to this Section 9.2(b),

provided further, that the Equityholder Indemnified Parties can only execute
any claim pursuant to this Section 9.2(b) against Parent through the

SECTION 9.3 Limitations.

  


 

  

(a) The indemnification obligations under Section 9.2 shall be subject to each
of the following limitations:

  

  

(i) there shall be no obligation on the part of the Equityholders to indemnify
the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 9 .2(a) to the extent that any
claim for indemnification relates

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

to an amount otherwise taken into account in determining the Working Capital,
Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Indebtedness;

  


 

  

(ii) the Damages suffered by any Indemnified Party shall be calculated after
giving effect to any amounts recovered from third parties, including insurance
proceeds, in each case net of the reasonable third party out-of- pocket costs
and expenses associated with such recoveries, and taking into account any tax
benefit and/or tax detriment actually realized or incurred by the Indemnified
Party and its Affiliates that is associated with such Damages or the receipt
of an indemnification payment in respect thereof (it being understood and
agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to seek insurance recoveries in respect of Damages to be indemnified
hereunder). If any insurance proceeds or other recoveries from third parties
are actually realized (in each case calculated net of the reasonable third
party out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with such recoveries) by an
Indemnified Party subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of an
indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such
insurance proceedings or third party recoveries relate, the Indemnified Party
shall hold such amounts in trust and appropriate refunds shall be made
promptly to the Indemnifying Party regarding the amount of such
indemnification payment;

  


 

  

(iii) there shall be no obligation to indemnify for any Damages which would
not have arisen but for any alteration or repeal or enactment of any Law after
the Closing Date; and

  


 

  

(iv) all indemnification payments under Section 9.2(a) shall be made
exclusively by payments from the General Escrow Account and, upon the
depletion of the General Escrow Account, there shall be no further recoveries
by the Parent Indemnified Parties whatsoever.

  


 

  

(b) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the same set of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

  


 

  

(c) PARENT AND THE EQUITYHOLDERS ON BEHALF OF EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST REVENUES OR
PROFITS, UNLESS (X) SUCH INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OR THE
PROXIMATE RESULT OF THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE THERETO OR THE MATTER FOR WHICH
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT HEREUNDER OR (Y) SUCH INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER KIND OF SPECIAL DAMAGES ARE
AWARDED TO A PERSON IN AN INDEMNIFIABLE THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.4 Limitation on Set-off. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have
any right to set-off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this
Article IX against any payment due pursuant to Article II or III.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.5 Mitigation. The Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Damages.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.6 Third Party Claim Procedures.

  

  

(a) The Party seeking indemnification under Section 9.2 (the "Indemnified
Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the Party against whom
indemnity is to be sought (or the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Equityholders' Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) in the case of
an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.2(a) against the Equityholders)
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement
of any Action by any third party (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under such section. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  


 

  

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 9.6, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense; provided, that prior to assuming
control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must (i) acknowledge that, if
the facts as alleged by the claimant in the Third Party Claim are true, it
would have an indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting from such Third
Party Claim as provided under this Article IX and (ii) must furnish the
Indemnified Party with reasonable evidence that the Indemnifying Party has
adequate resources to defend the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnity
obligations hereunder.

  

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control
of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of
one counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the Indemnifying Party
does not deliver the acknowledgment referred to in Section 9.6(b)(i) within
thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 9.3(a), (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, Action, indictment or allegation, (iii) the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to
the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to the reputation or future
business prospects of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) the
Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (v) the Indemnifying Party (or the
Equityholders' Representative on behalf of the Equityholders) has failed or is
failing to prosecute or defend vigorously the Third Party Claim or (vi) in the
case of a Parent Indemnified Party as the Indemnified Party, if the amount of
the Third Party Claim, if determined in favor of the claimant, would
reasonably result in Damages, together with all other claims for
indemnification hereunder, that would exceed the remaining amount of the
General Escrow Amount. The Indemnified Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party before entering into any settlement of a
Third Party Claim.

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.6, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the
settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates from all Liabilities with respect to such Third Party Claim
or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(e) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in
which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by
the Indemnified Party; provided, that in such event the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the fees and expenses of one such separate counsel (i) incurred by
the Indemnified Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control
of the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) if representation of both the
Indemnifying 
 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Party, create a conflict of interest.

  


 

  

(f) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.7 Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnity under Section 9.2 against an Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity obligation for any Damages
with respect to such claim, the Parties shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 10.11. 
 

  


 

  

SECTION 9.8 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Parties agree that any
indemnity payments pursuant to this Article IX shall be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Total Cash Equity Price to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.9 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Effective Time, except for
the Consent Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal and the Escrow Agreement and
in the case of fraud, Section 2.7 , Section 3.2 and this Article IX shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties and the other
Indemnified Parties in connection with all matters in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (whether
based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise).

  


 

  

ARTICLE X. 
 

  

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  


 

  

SECTION 10.1 Equityholders' Representative.

  


 

  

(a) Appointment. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders, and without further action of any Equityholder, each
Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed
Canaan VII L.P. (and by execution of this Agreement it hereby accepts such
appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact ("Equityholders' Representative")
for and on behalf of the Equityholders (in their capacity as such), with full
power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of each
Equityholder with respect to Section 2.7, Article III, Article IX, Article X,
and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the Equityholders' Representative
of any and all actions, including litigating, defending or enforcing any
actions, delivering or signing any certificates, notice, consent or instrument
required or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement or for the
enforcement of any rights the Equityholders have against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, hiring or retaining, at the sole expense of the
Equityholders, such counsel, investment bankers, accountants, representatives
and other professional advisors as it determines in its sole and absolute
discretion to be necessary, advisable or appropriate in order to carry out and
perform its rights and obligations hereunder and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Equityholders' Representative under
this

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that the
Equityholders' Representative shall have no right to pursue any claim on
behalf of any Company Indemnified Party in respect of the rights granted to
Company Indemnified Parties under Section 6.5). The power of attorney granted
in this Section 10.1 is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be
delegated by the Equityholders' Representative and shall survive the death or
incapacity of each Equityholder. Such agency may be changed by, (x) prior to
the Effective Time, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a
majority of the shares of the outstanding Company Capital Stock (excluding the
Series C -1 Preferred Stock) voting or consenting, as the case may be, on an
as-converted to Common Stock basis and (y) after the Effective Time, the
holders of a majority in interest of the General Escrow Account from time to
time until all obligations under this Agreement have been discharged
(including within twenty (20) Business Days in the event of the death,
disability or other incapacity of an Equityholders' Representative that is an
individual), and any such successor shall succeed the Equityholders'
Representative as Equityholders' Representative hereunder. No bond shall be
required of the Equityholders' Representative, and the Equityholders'
Representative shall receive no compensation for its services.

  


 

  

 

(b) Limitation on Liability. The Equityholders' Representative shall not be
liable to any Person for any act of the Equityholders' Representative taken in
good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith and reasonable judgment), except to the extent any
Liability or Damage is actually incurred by such Person as a proximate result
of the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders' Representative. The
Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable for, and may seek
indemnification from the Equityholders for, any Liability or Damage incurred
by the Equityholders' Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of its reasonable judgment and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, except to the extent that any such Liability or Damage is
the proximate result of the gross negligence or bad faith of the
Equityholders' Representative. The Equityholders' Representative Escrow
Account shall be available to indemnify and hold the Equityholders'
Representative harmless against any Liability or Damage incurred by the
Equityholders' Representative arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, except to the extent that any such Liability or Damage is the
proximate result of the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders'
Representative. The Equityholders' Representative shall be entitled to recover
any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Equityholders'
Representative in connection with actions taken by the Equityholders'
Representative pursuant to the terms of Section 2.7, Article III, Article IX,
Article X or the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and
the incurring of legal fees and costs) from the Equityholders' Representative
Escrow Account.

   
 

  

(c) Access. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Equityholders' Representative with
reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the
reasonable assistance of the officers and employees of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for the purposes of performing its duties and exercising
its rights under this Agreement; provided, that the Equityholders'
Representative shall treat confidentially any nonpublic information about the
Surviving Corporation (except in connection with the performance by the
Equityholders' Representative of its duties or the exercise of its rights
under this Agreement).

  


 

  

(d) Actions of the Equityholders' Representative. From and after the Effective
Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholders'
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Equityholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Equityholder, and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders'

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
Equityholder. Parent is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for
any acts done by Parent in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Equityholders' Representative.

  


 

  

(e) Representations and Warranties. The Equityholders' Representative, solely

(iii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Equityholders' Representative and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other Parties to this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a
legally valid and binding obligation of the Equityholders' Representative,

terms, except as enforceability may be limited by principles of public policy,
and subject to (A) the effect of any applicable Law of general application
relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, or moratorium or similar
Laws affecting creditors' rights and relief of debtors generally and (B) the
effect of rules of Law and general principles of equity, including rules of
Law and general principles of equity governing specific performance,
injunctive relieve and other equitable remedies (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law); and

  


 

  

(iv) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Equityholders'
Representative, and the performance by the Equityholders' Representative of
its obligations hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement do not and will not
(A) conflict with or result in a violation of the organizational documents of
the Equityholders' Representative, (B) violate any Law applicable to the
Equityholders' Representative or (C) require any consent or approval that has

SECTION 10.4 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, any listing agreement with any U.S. or U.K. securities exchange or share
market, or any listing authority including the U.K. Listing Authority, no
Party to this Agreement shall make any public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise
communicate with any news media regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties to this Agreement; provided, that if any such announcement or
communication is so required, the Parties shall consult with each other, to
the extent reasonably practicable, in advance as to the contents and timing
thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.5 Interpretation. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits in this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, are references to Articles, Sections,
Schedules and Exhibits of or to this Agreement. The Parties to this Agreement
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with
respect to any term or provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties to this Agreement, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
to this Agreement by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the word
"including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without
limitation;" (ii) words (including defined terms) in the singular shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (iii) words of one gender shall
be deemed to include the other gender as the context requires; (iv) the terms
"hereof," "herein," "hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole (including all of the Exhibits to this Agreement) and not to any
particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified;
and (v) unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, accounting terms shall
have the respective meanings assigned to them in accordance with GAAP.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.6 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the terms or
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate, instrument
or other document referred to in this Agreement, shall, for any reason, be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or any other such certificate, instrument or other document
referred to in this Agreement. Any term or provision of this Agreement held
invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain jurisdictions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the Parties as
reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Party waives any term or provision of Law which renders any term or provision
of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

SECTION 10.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits to this
Agreement), the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the Parties to this Agreement with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
the Confidentiality Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties to this Agreement with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties to
this Agreement (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties to this Agreement, and any purported
assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; provided, that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Sub. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

SECTION 10.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for Article II, Article III
and Section 6.5, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 10.10 Waivers and Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed by all of the Parties to this
Agreement. Any failure of the Parties to this Agreement to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived
by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument
signed by the Party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any Party to
this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party to
this Agreement of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the Parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at
Law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on
behalf of a Party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this Section 10.10.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.11 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes
between the Parties under or related to the Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed
entirely within such State, without regard to conflict of law principles that
would result in the application of any Laws other than the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting within the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to
this

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
Action except in such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such Action may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court or, to
the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court; (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Action in any
such Delaware State or Federal court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the Parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the Parties to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 10.3. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect
the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

   
 

  

(b) Buyer Parent hereby irrevocably designates, appoints, authorizes and
empowers as agent for service of process, Parent, to accept, for and on behalf
of Buyer Parent, service of any and all process, notices or other documents
that may be served in any Action relating hereto in any Delaware State or
Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.12.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.13 Equitable Remedies. Each of the Parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties to this Agreement would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other Parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
any other Party under this Agreement, and each Party to this Agreement hereby
agrees to waive the defense (and not to interpose as a defense or in
opposition) in any such suit that the other Parties to this Agreement have an
adequate remedy at Law, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any
bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies
described in this Section 10.13 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other remedies at Law or in equity that the Parties to this Agreement may
elect to pursue.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 10.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission, or by
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a
valid and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
".pdf" format data file signature page were an original thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.15 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to
the performance of this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number
of days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are
specified. Whenever any action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is
not a Business Day, then such action may be validly taken on or by the next
day that is a Business Day.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.16 Legal Representation. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that the Company, the Equityholders' Representative and the Principal
Stockholders (and their respective Affiliates) have retained Latham and Watkins
LLP ("Sellers' Counsel") to act as their counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that Sellers' Counsel has not acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that no other party or Person has the status of a client of the
Sellers' Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result
thereof. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates and the Equityholders' Representative, the
Principal Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates, Sellers' Counsel
may represent the Equityholders' Representative, the Principal Stockholders or
any of their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests
of the Equityholders' Representative, the Principal Stockholders or any of
their respective Affiliates may be directly adverse to Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates and
even though Sellers' Counsel may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute, and Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates hereby waive, on
behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, any conflict of interest in
connection with such representation by Sellers' Counsel. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that, as to all pre-Closing
communications among Sellers' Counsel, the Company and any stockholder of the
Company that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence
and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the Equityholders'
Representative, the Principal Stockholders and their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, and may be controlled by the Equityholders' Representative, the
Principal Stockholders and their respective Affiliates and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that the foregoing
sentence will not be applicable with respect to disputes or claims arising
under Article IX of the Merger Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates to take, all steps
necessary to implement the intent of this Section 10.16.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.17 Buyer Parent Guarantee. In consideration of, and as an
inducement to the Company and the Equityholders' Representative entering into
this Agreement and performing their obligations hereunder, Buyer Parent hereby
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Company and the
Equityholders' Representative the full performance and payment by Parent and
Merger Sub of the covenants, obligations, monetary or otherwise, and
undertakings of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to or otherwise in connection
with this Agreement (the "Buyer Guaranteed Obligations"). Upon breach of, or
other failure to perform, any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation,
agreement or undertaking of Parent or Merger Sub, the Company or the
Equityholders'

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

 

Representative shall give written notice of such breach or failure to Buyer
Parent, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and basis
of such breach or failure, and Buyer Parent shall have three (3) Business Days
from the date such notice is given to Buyer Parent to cause Parent or Merger
Sub to perform its obligations with respect to such breach or failure;
provided, that if such obligations are not satisfied within such three (3)
Business Day period, the Company and the Equityholders' Representative shall
have the right, exercisable in their sole discretion, to pursue any and all
available remedies they may have under this Agreement arising out of any such
breach or nonperformance directly against any or all of Parent, Merger Sub and
Buyer Parent in the first instance. In this respect, for the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer Parent confirms that it is bound by the provisions of Section
10.3, Section 10.5, Section 10.6, Section 10.7, Section 10.8, Section 10.9,
Section 10.10, Section 10.11, Section 10.12, Section 10.13 and Section 10.14
as if it were a "Party" therein. This guarantee is a guarantee of performance
and not exclusively of collection. Without limiting any rights or defenses
that would be available to Buyer Parent if it were a direct obligor hereunder
or any rights or defenses that Buyer Parent, Parent or Merger Sub has
hereunder, (x) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyer Parent hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law
that would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Company or the
Equityholders' Representative and (y) except for the second sentence of this
Section 10.17, Buyer Parent waives promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this guaranty and of the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of any Buyer Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other
notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Buyer Parent, and
all suretyship defenses generally. Buyer Parent's obligations under this
Section 10.17 shall terminate upon the satisfaction by Parent and Merger Sub
of their obligations hereunder. Buyer Parent acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits in connection with this Agreement and
that the waivers set forth in this Section 10.17 are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.
