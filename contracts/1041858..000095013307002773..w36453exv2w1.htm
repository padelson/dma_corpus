<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement desire to effect the acquisition of the Company by
Parent through a merger of the Company and Buyer;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;), Buyer

Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Buyer shall be merged with and
into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Buyer shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the
&#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;). The corporate existence of the Company, with all of its
purposes, rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall continue unaffected and
unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it shall be governed by the DGCL.

within five business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI (other than those conditions which by their terms can only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the parties shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the &#147;<U>Certificate of
Merger</U>&#148;) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by making all other filings
or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or at such other time (but not earlier than the time that the Certificate of
Merger is filed) as the parties agree shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and
time the Merger becomes effective, the &#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148;). On the date of such filing, a
closing (the &#147;<U>Closing</U>&#148;) shall be held at 10:00&nbsp;a.m., New York time, at the offices of
Andrews Kurth LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, 15<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> Floor, New York, New York 10017, or at

the Paying Agent or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such payment shall pay all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid
or are not applicable. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be

Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such claim, action, suit,
