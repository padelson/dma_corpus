AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 24, 2007, by and among RCN CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), RAVEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ ") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and NEON COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement desire to effect the acquisition of the Company by Parent through a merger of the Company and Buyer; 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Buyer shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, with the Company as the surviving corporation; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Buyer and the Company have approved this Agreement and deem it advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the consideration to be paid for each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company_ _Common Stock_ "), and for each share of 6% Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ ," and together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ "), in the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of the Company Capital Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") and resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and certain Company Stockholders are entering into support agreements (the " _Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which, among other things, such Company Stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of Company Capital Stock in favor of adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Buyer shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Buyer shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The corporate existence of the Company, with all of its purposes, rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it shall be governed by the DGCL. 

  

 Section 1.2. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within five business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by their terms can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by making all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time (but not earlier than the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed) as the parties agree shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ "). On the date of such filing, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10017, or at such other time and location as the parties shall otherwise agree. 

  

 Section 1.3. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Buyer shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Buyer shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.4. _Conversion of Company Capital Stock and Buyer Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, the Company or the holders of any of the securities described in this Section 1.4: 

   

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.4(c) and Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be canceled and, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount payable without interest, to the holder of such share of Company Common Stock, upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (the " _Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "). As used herein, " _Per Share Amount_ " means (x) $5.25 if the Adjusted Consolidated Revenue of the Company for the Testing Period applicable to the Closing (the " _Testing Period Revenue_ "), is greater than or equal to the applicable aggregate amount for the three calendar months in the Testing Period set forth on Part A of _Schedule 8.11_ hereof or (y) $5.15 plus the product, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one cent, of (I) $0.10 and (II) (A) the positive difference, if any, between the Testing Period Revenue and the applicable aggregate 

   ##### 

  

   

amount for the three calendar months in the Testing Period set forth in Part
B of _Schedule 8.11_ hereof, divided by (B) the difference between the
applicable aggregate amount for the three calendar months in the Testing
Period set forth in Part A of _Schedule 8.11_ hereof and the applicable
aggregate amount for the three calendar months in the Testing Period
set forth in Part B of _Schedule 8.11_ hereof (but in no event greater that
$5.25); 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.4(c) and Dissenting Shares, if any), including any and all rights with respect to accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such Company Preferred Stock, shall be canceled and, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount payable without interest, to the holder of such share of Company Preferred Stock, upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Preferred Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (the " _Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ " and together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "); 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent, Buyer or any subsidiary of Parent, and each share of Company Capital Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by a Subsidiary shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, all shares of the Company Capital Stock converted pursuant to Section 1.4(a) or (b) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Capital Stock (" _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article I; and 

   

 (e) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, from and after the Effective Time, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.5. _Dissenting Shares_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by the Company Stockholders who have demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of such shares of Company Capital Stock in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as described in Section 1.4(a) or (b), as applicable, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holderÂ’s shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, as described in Section 1.4(a) or (b), as applicable, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in such provisions, without any interest thereon. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL with respect to demands for appraisal and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 Section 1.6. _Stock Options and Warrants_. 

   

 (a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") granted under the Globix Corporation 2003 Stock Option Plan, the Neon Communications, Inc. 2003 DirectorsÂ’ Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the Neon Communications, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") shall be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof, without any action on the part of such holder and in full consideration of such cancellation, shall be entitled to receive, promptly following the Effective Time, from the Surviving Corporation with respect to each share of Company Common Stock issuable under such cancelled Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether or not such Company Options are vested and exercisable), an amount (the " _Option Amount_ ") in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the stated dollar amount of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of the Company Option, less any withholding taxes as described in Section 1.7(e) and without interest. After the Effective Time, holders of canceled Company Options shall have no further rights in respect of such canceled Company Options except the right to receive the Option Amount provided by this Section 1.6(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors or committee of the Company, as applicable, will adopt such resolutions and will take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 1.6(a), without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation other than the right to receive the Option Amount provided by this Section 1.6(a). 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, all Company Warrants will be automatically exercisable for the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of any Company Warrant to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 1.7(f), the holder of such Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (a) the excess, if any, of the stated dollar amount of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of the Company Warrant by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could have purchased had such holder exercised the Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time less any withholding taxes as described in Section 1.7(e) and without interest. 

  

 Section 1.7. _Surrender of Shares of Company Capital Stock; Stock Transfer Books_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with such Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Paying Agent will act as agent for the Company Stockholders and receive the funds necessary to make the payments to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.4 upon surrender of the Company StockholdersÂ’ Certificates and pursuant to Section 1.6 in the case of holders who exercise Company Warrants. Parent shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, deposit with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock and the 

   ##### 

  

   

consideration to be paid to holders of Company Warrants pursuant to Section
1.6 (the " _Fund_ "). Subject to the Paying Agent Agreement, the Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be
payable to Parent. Parent shall promptly replace any monies lost through any
investment made pursuant to this Section 1.7(a) or otherwise satisfy any
deficiency in the amount of the Fund necessary to pay the Merger
Consideration and the consideration to be paid to holders of Company
Warrants pursuant to Section 1.6. The Paying Agent shall make the payments
provided in Section 1.4. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Capital Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 a customary form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration for each share of each series of Company Capital Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, at and after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall accrue or be paid to any beneficial owner of shares of Company Capital Stock or any holder of any Certificate with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed in blank or to the Paying Agent or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

   

 (c) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Fund that had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to the Company Stockholders (including, to the extent not previously delivered to Parent, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all amounts held in the Fund or other funds made available to it), and thereafter each such holder shall be entitled to look only to Parent who shall remain liable for such amounts (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws), and only as general creditors thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date as shall be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), unclaimed funds payable with respect to such 

   ##### 

  

   

Certificates shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Buyer, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any Company Stockholder for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share of Company Capital Stock or
Company Warrant to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, except for Parent and Buyer, the Company Stockholders holding shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration and as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law, and the Merger Consideration paid pursuant to this Article I upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Buyer for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.4. 

   

 (e) Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Stockholder, any holder of Company Options or Company Warrants (each, a " _Payee_ ") such amounts that Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Payee. 

   

 (f) Upon the surrender to the Paying Agent of an original copy of a Company Warrant, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder such amount as the holder of the Warrant shall be entitled to pursuant to Section 1.6(b). The procedures set forth in this Section 1.7 shall apply to any surrender of a Company Warrant. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

The certificate of incorporation of Buyer at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or repealed in accordance with applicable Law or such certificate of incorporation; _provided, however,_ that Article I shall be amended to provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the name of the Company.

 (c) Without limiting Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(b): 

   

 (i) Parent shall as promptly as practicable prepare and file (with the assistance of the Company), or cause to be prepared and filed (with the assistance of the Company), the necessary applications, requests, notices and other filings, and thereafter shall timely make all other filings and notifications, required to obtain all FCC Approvals and State Approvals.

 (ii) Parent and the Company shall promptly provide to the other party a copy of any pleading, order or other document served on it relating to such applications (but no party shall have any obligation to take any steps to satisfy complainants, if any, which steps would have a Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect); 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Approvals and the State Approvals and oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the applications for the FCC Approvals and State Approvals, and any requests for reconsideration or review of any FCC Approval; and

 Section 5.6. _Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification and exculpation by the Company now existing as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement and without regard to any subsequent amendment or other modification thereof, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been made available to Parent, shall survive the Merger, and Parent shall, subject to Section 5.6(c), (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force and effect for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time; and (ii) perform, or cause the Surviving Corporation to perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation with respect thereto (without regard to any discharge of such obligation by the Surviving Corporation in any bankruptcy or similar proceeding). Parent and Buyer agree that any claims for indemnification hereunder as to which they have received written notice prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive, whether or not such claims shall have been finally adjudicated or settled. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of the Company and each Subsidiary and each such person who served at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent, in each case occurring on or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel selected by any Indemnified Party (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Surviving Corporation) promptly after statements therefor are received; and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided, further,_  that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.6(c) to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group. 

   

 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) Indemnified Parties (" _D andO Insurance_") ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to the Indemnified Parties);  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.6(c) more than an amount per year 

   ##### 

  

    

equal to 200% of the 2007 annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance (the amount of which premium is set forth on _Section 5.6 of the
Company Disclosure Letter_). In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required
to expend more than 200% of the 2007 annual premiums, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to 200% of the 2007 annual premiums. If the
Surviving Corporation elects to reduce the amount of insurance coverage
pursuant to the preceding sentence, it will furnish to the officers and
directors currently covered by such DandO Insurance reasonable notice of
such reduction in coverage and shall, to the extent additional coverage is
available, afford such persons the opportunity to pay such additional
premiums as may be necessary to maintain the existing level of DandO Insurance
coverage. In lieu of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6(c), the
Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid
officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability insurance policy in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Party who was covered by the existing DandO Insurance, provided
that the premium for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed 135% of
the 2007 annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6. 

   

 (e) The obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent under this Section 5.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.6 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that each such any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6). 

  

 Section 5.7. _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and the Company shall consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading system to which Parent or the Company is a party, and Parent and the Company will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement to which the restrictions of the foregoing sentence apply without the consent of the other parties, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 Section 5.8. _Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendations_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall, on the date hereof, terminate (and shall cause each Subsidiary to terminate) all negotiations and discussions with all other parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate the making of, any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal;  _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not 

   ##### 

  

    

prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from waiving applicable
provisions of a standstill agreement to permit a person to make an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, or having discussions or negotiations with,
or furnishing non-public information to, any person that makes an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Company Stockholders if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company, based upon the advice of independent outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that such action is required for the Board
of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company Stockholders under the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware; (B)
prior to taking such action, the Company receives from such person an
executed agreement in reasonably customary form relating to the
confidentiality of any non-public information to be provided to such person
and which does not contain terms that prevent the Company from complying with
its obligations under this Section 5.8; and (C) the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, based upon advice from its independent
financial advisor, taking into account all financial considerations,
including the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal deemed relevant by the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors, the
identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, and the conditions
and prospects for completing the Acquisition Proposal, including the
obligations of the Company under Section 7.2, that such Acquisition Proposal
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. The Company shall
provide prompt notice to Parent of the receipt of any such Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal.
Thereafter, the Company shall continue to keep Parent fully and promptly
informed of the status and material changes to the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " means, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any offer or proposal relating to (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
and the Subsidiaries or over 20% of any class of equity or voting securities
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the
Company or such Subsidiary; (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender
offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third
party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of the Company or such Subsidiary; or (iii) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of substantially
all of the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company or such Subsidiary. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona
fide Acquisition Proposal made in writing that is on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with the CompanyÂ’s legal counsel and financial advisors) are more favorable
to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger, taking into account all financial considerations, including the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal
deemed relevant by the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors, the identity of the
person making the Acquisition Proposal and the conditions and prospects for
completing the Acquisition Proposal, including the obligations of the Company
under Section 7.2. 

   

 (c) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) if any proposal or offer relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives.

Thereafter, the Company will notify the Parent in writing of its intention
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change at least three (3) business days
prior to taking such action, specifying the material terms of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, and permit
Parent, within such three (3) business day period, to make an offer that the
Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders
as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall not
effect any Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Superior
Proposal prior to the expiration of such three (3) business day period, and
that the Company shall postpone or adjourn the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, as
necessary, to accommodate the procedures set forth in this sentence. If
within such three (3) business day period, Parent makes an offer that
the Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall so notify the counterparty to the
Superior Proposal of ParentÂ’s offer, and thereafter continue to negotiate in

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders at the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, (x) in response to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal and, in connection with such Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company and the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 5.8) shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) disclosing the fact that the Board of Directors of the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal and the terms of such proposal, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines, after consultation with its legal counsel, that the failure to take any such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or to comply with obligations under federal securities Laws or NASDAQ or the rules and regulations of any U.S. securities exchange upon which the Company Common Stock is listed.

 (c) The Company will as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement prepare the Proxy Statement, file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, and use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest practical time. Parent shall furnish all information concerning it as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such actions. The Company will notify the other parties promptly of the receipt of the comments of the SEC, if any, and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto, and will supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger, and, after consultation with Parent, the Company shall respond promptly to any such comments by, or request for additional information from, the SEC.

Thereafter, Parent will provide, or will cause a subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each Company Employee the opportunity to participate in employee benefit plans, programs and policies which provide benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to employees of Parent who have comparable duties and responsibilities and work schedules.

 (c) Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed as a contract of employment, and this Section 5.11 shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the employ of Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.11(a) and Section 5.11(b), nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to require the provision of coverage or benefits to a Company Employee except to the extent such coverage or benefits is otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law, the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement or any employment agreement or employment offer letter. 

   

 (d) Parent will honor, or will cause a subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Company to honor, any obligations which the Company has at the Effective Time under any Company Benefit Plans (including any employment agreements between the Company or a Subsidiary and a Company Employee) to any employee or former employee or any of their dependents. Nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to cause any Company Employees to be third-party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions of this Section 5.11 or have any rights to enforce such provisions against the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, a Company Employee whose employment terminates during the one-year period immediately following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive the severance payments and benefits provided under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the severance policy described in _Section 5.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ (without amendment on or after the Effective Time).

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any financing required by it to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not in the reasonable judgment of the Company unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) providing reasonably required information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the parties providing such financing, (ii) assisting in the preparation of (A) any offering documents for any debt financing, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, including execution and delivery of customary representation letters reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company in connection with bank information memoranda, (iii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for any debt financing (including consenting to the use of the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos), (iv) executing and delivering, and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, reasonable and customary certificates, management representations to support accounting comfort letters, and legal opinions (including a reasonable and customary certificate of the principal financial officer of 

   #####

letters, consents of accountants for use of their reports in materials related
to any debt financing, and legal opinions, as may be reasonably requested by

furnishing Parent and, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings, its

Parent, and (vii) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of any
debt financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under any such agreement, document or instrument
shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other liability or out-of-pocket expense in connection with any
such financing prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 5.13. _Rule 16b-3_.

 (c) In the event that (x) this Agreement shall be terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h) and (y) at the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal by any person (other than Parent, Buyer or their respective affiliates) has been publicly announced and not withdrawn, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee within three business 

   ##### 

  

    

days after entering into a definitive agreement to consummate an
Acquisition Proposal, provided that such agreement is entered into within 12
months after such termination (and for purposes of this Section 7.2(c),
references to 20% in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" as such term
relates to the definitive agreement to enter into an Acquisition Proposal
within 12 months after such termination shall be deemed to be references to
50%); _provided, however_ , that if the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change at or prior to the
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
Termination Fee shall be paid within three business days of such
termination. 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Termination Fee_ " means
$6,500,000. All payments under this Section 7.2 shall be made in cash by wire
transfer to the account designated in  _Section 7.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ or such other account designated by Parent in writing to
the Company prior to the time of such termination. The Company acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section
7.2, and, in order to obtain such payments, Parent commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for the payments set forth in this
Section 7.2, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Termination Fee and other amounts to be reimbursed to Parent
under this Section 7.2 from the date payments were required to be made until
the date of such payments at the prime rate publicly announced in the _Wall
Street Journal_ as in effect on the date such payments were required to
be made plus one percent (1%). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to a
provision that calls for a payment to be made under this Section 7.2, it
shall not be a defense to the CompanyÂ’s obligation to pay hereunder that this
Agreement could have been terminated under a different provision or could
have been terminated at an earlier or later time. 

   

 Section 7.3. _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended except by action taken or authorized prior to the Effective Time by each of the parties set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made without the further approval of the Company Stockholders, if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the Merger Consideration or change the form thereof or if such further approval is otherwise required by the DGCL. Parent shall not amend any Support Agreement in any material respect without the consent of the Company. 

  

 Section 7.4. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any party may, if in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party; or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations; _provided, however_ , that no such waiver may occur following the Effective Time. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
