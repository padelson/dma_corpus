SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of October 29,
2018 (the " _Execution Date_ "), by and among EnerSys, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Purchaser_ " or, alternatively, " _Parent_ "), Alpha Innovations
Limited, a Cyprus company, (" _Seller 1_ "), Alphatec Limited, a Cyprus
company (" _Seller 2_ "), Radiant Energy Systems Limited, a Cyprus company ("
_Seller 3_ " and, together with Seller 1 and Seller 2, the " _Sellers_ "), and
solely in its capacity as representative as set forth in this Agreement,
Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller
Representative_ ").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. The Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests (the "
_Shares_ ") of the Target Companies (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ), all as more
specifically set forth on _Schedule I_.

  

  

B. Following the Execution Date and at or prior to the Closing, in furtherance
of the Restructuring contemplated herein, Alpha Technology Services, Inc. ("
_ATS_ "), will enter into (i) that certain Asset Purchase Agreement with
Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. (" _Altair_ "), (ii) that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement with Alpha Technologies, Inc. (" _ATI_ ") and each of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, (iii) that certain Asset Purchase Agreement with
Telecomponents Systems, Inc. (" _TCS_ "), and (iv) that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement with AlphaTec Ltd. (" _AlphaTec_ "), a master form of which is
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (such asset purchase agreements collectively,
the " _Restructuring Agreements_ ").

  

  

C. The Sellers desire to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to
purchase from the Sellers, the Shares, immediately prior to the effective time
of the Restructuring and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound and in consideration of the
mutual provisions set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1 
  THE TRANSACTION

  

  

 _Section 1.1 __Share Purchase_. On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Purchaser (or a designated Affiliate of the
Purchaser) will purchase from each Seller, and each Seller will sell, convey,
assign, transfer, and deliver to the Purchaser (or a designated Affiliate of
the Purchaser), the Shares set forth across from each Seller\'s name in the
column titled "Shares and Pro Rata Percentages" on _Schedule I_ , free and
clear of any Encumbrances (other than any restrictions on the transferability
of such securities under applicable securities Laws), for the consideration
set forth across from each Seller\'s name in the column titled "Purchase
Price" on _Schedule I_ , as it may be adjusted pursuant to this _ARTICLE 1_.

  

  

 _Section 1.2 __Purchase Price; Estimated Closing Statement;_ _Closing
Consideration_.

  

  

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Shares (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
will be an amount equal to (i) $750,000,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_ ");
minus (ii) Closing Net Debt; minus (iii) Closing Transaction Expenses; plus
(iv) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Target Working Capital; or minus (v) the amount, if any, by which the Target
Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital (the aggregate sum
obtained by subtracting clauses (ii) and (iii), and adding clause (iv) or
subtracting clause (v), as applicable, the " _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_
"), as ultimately determined pursuant to _Section 1.3_.

  

  

 

1   

 

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchase Price
will be paid as follows:

  

  

(i) $100,000,000 of the Purchase Price (the " _Equity Component_ ") will be
paid in Parent Shares, cash or a combination thereof, in accordance with the
following:

  

  

(A) If the Closing VWAP is between $65.00 and $95.00, the Parent will issue to
Sellers the number of Parent Shares equal to the Equity Component divided by
the Closing VWAP.

  

  

(B) If the Closing VWAP is greater than $95.00, the Sellers may elect to
receive all or a portion of the Equity Component in cash. If the Sellers elect
to receive only a portion of the Equity Component in cash pursuant to this
_Section 1.2(b)(i)(B)_ , then the Parent will issue to Sellers the number of
Parent Shares equal to the remaining portion of the Equity Component divided
by the Closing VWAP.

  

  

(C) If the Closing VWAP is less than $65.00, Purchaser may elect to pay all or
a portion of the Equity Component in cash. If Purchaser elects to pay only a
portion of the Equity Component in cash pursuant to this _Section
1.2(b)(i)(C)_ , then the Parent will issue to Sellers the number of Parent
Shares equal to the remaining portion of the Equity Component divided by the
Closing VWAP.

  

  

(ii) The remainder of the Purchase Price will be paid in cash.

  

  

(c) The Sellers acknowledge that 50% of the Equity Component (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") and an amount in cash equal to the
Adjustment Escrow Amount will be withheld at the Closing and deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 1.4_. If the Sellers (pursuant to
_Section 1.2.(b)(i)(B)_ ) or the Buyer (pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)(i)(C)_ )
elect to receive a portion of the Equity Component in cash, then the
Indemnification Escrow Amount will consist of the same proportion of Parent
Shares to cash as that for the Equity Component, as determined pursuant to
_Section 1.2(b)(i)_ above.

  

  

(d) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers will
deliver to the Purchaser a complete and final version of _Schedule I_ hereto,
an unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and a written statement (together with
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Sellers\' good faith estimate, as of the Closing Date, of:

  

  

(i) the Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ");

  

  

(ii) Closing Net Debt, together with the Persons to whom such outstanding
Indebtedness is owed and the wire instructions for such Persons (the "
_Estimated Closing Net Debt_ "); and

  

  

(iii) Closing Transaction Expenses, together with the Persons to whom such
outstanding Transaction Expenses are owed and the wire instructions for such
Persons (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ").

  

  

The Estimated Closing Statement will be calculated in accordance with the
procedures, policies and methods set forth on, and used in preparing, the
Example Statement.

  

  

 

2   

 

  

(e) At the Closing, the Base Purchase Price will be adjusted using the
estimates and calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement as
follows (the aggregate sum of such adjustments, the " _Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment_ ", and the net amount after giving effect to the Estimated
Purchase Price Adjustment, the " _Closing Consideration_ "):

  

  

(i) Either (A) increased by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Working
Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital, if any, or (B) decreased by the
amount by which the Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, if any;

  

  

(ii) increased or decreased by the amount of Estimated Closing Net Debt; and

  

  

(iii) decreased by the amount of Estimated Transaction Expenses.

  

  

 _Section 1.3 __Post-_ _Closing Adjustment_.

  

  

(a) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a written statement
(together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth the Purchaser\'s calculations (the " _Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations_ ") of (i) the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net Debt, the
Closing Transaction Expenses and the resulting purchase price adjustment based
on the Closing Balance Sheet, and (ii) the Purchase Price based on the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net Debt and the
Closing Transaction Expenses calculated by reference thereto. The Closing
Balance Sheet and the Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and the procedures, policies and methods set forth on,
and used in preparing, the Example Statement.

  

  

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement and the Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations, the Seller Representative will have 30 days (the " _Review
Period_ ") to review the Closing Statement and the Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations. During the Review Period, the Seller Representative and
Sellers\' accountants will have reasonable access to the books and records of
the Acquired Companies, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, the
Purchaser and/or the Purchaser\'s accountants to the extent necessary for
their evaluation of the Closing Statement and to such historical financial
information relating to the Closing Statement and the Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations as the Seller Representative may reasonably request for the
purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Purchase
Price and, if necessary, to prepare an Objection Statement (as defined below).

  

  

(c) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Sellers may object
to the Closing Statement and the Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations by
delivering to the Purchaser a written statement setting forth a description in
reasonable detail of its objections thereto (an " _Objection Statement_ "). If
no Objection Statement is delivered to the Purchaser by the Seller
Representative by the last day of the Review Period, the Closing Statement and
the Purchaser\'s Proposed Calculations will be deemed to have been accepted by
the Seller Representative, and thus the Sellers, and will be final and binding
upon the parties for all purposes under this Agreement.

  

  

 

3   

 

  

(d) If the Sellers timely deliver an Objection Statement to the Purchaser,
then the Purchaser and the Sellers will negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such objections set forth in the Objection Statement within 30 days after the
delivery of the Objection Statement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the
objections set forth in the Objection Statement are so resolved within the
Resolution Period, the Closing Statement and the Purchaser\'s Proposed
Calculations with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing
by the Purchaser and the Sellers, will be final and binding. If the Sellers
and the Purchaser fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the
matters set forth in the Objection Statement before expiration of the
Resolution Period, then any amount remaining in dispute will be submitted for
resolution to PwC or, if PwC is unwilling or unable to serve, then Grant
Thornton, or if neither PwC or Grant Thornton is willing or able to serve,
then the Purchaser and the Sellers will engage another mutually agreeable
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing, which firm is not
the regular auditing firm of the Purchaser, any Seller or any Acquired Company
(such selected independent accounting firm, the " _Independent Accounting
Firm_ "). The Independent Accounting Firm will be required to render a
determination of the applicable dispute within 30 days (or such other time as
the Seller Representative and the Purchaser mutually agree in writing) after
referral of the matter to the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination
must be in writing in the English language and must set forth in reasonable
detail the basis therefor. The Independent Accounting Firm may address only
those items and amounts which are identified in the Objection Statement as
being items which the Seller Representative and the Purchaser are unable to
resolve. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments will be made without
regard to materiality. The resolution of the dispute by the Independent
Accounting Firm will be final and binding on and non-appealable by the
parties.

  

  

(e) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated
between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage that the amount actually disputed but not awarded to
the Sellers or the Purchaser, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount
actually disputed by the Seller Representative and the Purchaser. The fee
portion payable by the Sellers will be split pro rata based on their Pro Rata
Percentages set forth in _Schedule I_.

  

  

(f) For purposes of complying with this _Section 1.3_ , the Purchaser and each
Seller will furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed items
as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and are available to
such Person (or its accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the
disputed items and to discuss such items with the Independent Accounting Firm.

  

  

(g) Upon the final determination, in accordance with this _Section 1.3_ , of
the Closing Statement and the final calculation of the amounts of the Closing
Working Capital, the Closing Net Debt and the Closing Transaction Expenses
calculated by reference thereto, the Final Purchase Price Adjustment will be
calculated using such finally determined amounts. If the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment is not equal to the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment, then a
payment will be made by the Purchaser to the Sellers, or by the Sellers to
Purchaser, as follows:

  

  

(i) if the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 1.3_ , is greater than the Closing Consideration, then the Purchaser
will pay the amount of such difference to the Sellers (pro rata based on the
Sellers\' Pro Rata Percentages); or

  

  

(ii) if the Closing Consideration is greater than the Purchase Price, as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1.3_ , then the Sellers
will pay the amount of such difference to the Purchaser (pro rata based on the
Sellers\' Pro Rata Percentages).

  

  

(h) Any payment to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.3(g)(ii)_ will be made
by the Escrow Agent solely from the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the
Purchaser\'s account specified on _Schedule II_ pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any amounts payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 1.3(g)(ii)_ will be satisfied solely from, and will be
exclusively limited to, the Adjustment Escrow Amount. Any payment to the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.3(g)_ will be paid to the Sellers by the
Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified on _Schedule I_. Any Adjustment Escrow Amount outstanding as of the
expiration of the Adjustment Payment Period (as defined below) will be
disbursed to the Sellers pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Any payment made
pursuant to this _Section 1.3(h)_ will be (i) made within three Business Days
of the date on which the Final Purchase Price Adjustment is determined (the "
_Adjustment Payment Period_ ") and (ii) treated as an adjustment to the final
purchase price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

  

  

 

4   

 

  

(i) The purpose of this _Section 1.3_ is to determine the final Purchase Price
to be paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement. Accordingly, any adjustment
pursuant hereto will neither be deemed to be an indemnification pursuant to
_ARTICLE 8_ , nor preclude any party from exercising any indemnification
rights pursuant to _ARTICLE 8_.

  

  

 _Section 1.4 __Escrow Accounts_. The Purchaser will withhold (i) the
Indemnification Escrow Amount from the Equity Component of the Closing
Consideration to serve as security for the benefit of the Purchaser (on behalf
of itself or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party) against the
indemnifications by the Sellers afforded by this Agreement and (ii) the
Adjustment Escrow Amount from the cash portion of the Closing Consideration
for any payment to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.3(g)_. On the Closing
Date, the Purchaser will deposit the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
Adjustment Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow
Amount will constitute the initial contribution to the Escrow Account, the
distribution of which will be governed according to the terms and conditions
set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

 _Section 1.5 __Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Baker
McKenzie, 660 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, California 94304 and, as needed, remotely
by electronic or facsimile transmissions, no later than two Business Days
after the last of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _ARTICLE 6_ has
been satisfied or waived (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) at

bargaining agreement or other Contract with any labor union or similar

bargaining agreements otherwise in effect with respect to such employees. No
labor organization or group of employees of an Acquired Company, or to the
extent related to the Transferred Business, of a Restructuring Seller, has
made a pending demand for recognition or certification, there are no labor
unions or similar organizations representing or, to the Sellers\' Knowledge,
attempting or threatening to represent any employee of the Acquired Companies,
nor have there been any labor organizing campaigns or representation or
certification proceedings or petitions pending with respect to the Acquired
Companies or the Transferred Business, or any of their employees or, to the

to be, in violation of any material term of any employment contract,
confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement,
noncompetition or other restrictive covenant agreement, or any other contract

each such employee does not subject the Acquired Companies to any material
liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters. The Acquired
Companies, and to the extent related to the Transferred Business, the
Restructuring Sellers, are in compliance in all material respects with all
Laws relating to employment and fair employment practices, immigration, terms

(d) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will cause
accelerated vesting, payment or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of any payment or benefit under or in connection with any Company Plan, this
Agreement (or any agreement, plan or other program contemplated in this
Agreement) or any Contract listed on _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Seller

(f) There have been no prohibited transactions with respect to any Company
Plan. No fiduciary has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other
failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment
of the assets of any Company Plan. No actions, claims (other than routine
benefit claims) or lawsuits have been asserted in writing or instituted
against any Company Plan or related trust, sponsor, administrator or
fiduciary, nor, to the Sellers\' Knowledge, are there facts that could
reasonably be expected to form the basis for any such action, claim or
lawsuit. To the Sellers\' Knowledge, no event has occurred respecting any
Company Plan which would entitle any person (without the consent of the
Acquired Companies, or to the extent related to the Transferred Business, the
Restructuring Sellers) to cause the wind-up or termination of any Company Plan
in whole or in part. No insurance policy or any other contract or agreement
affecting any Company Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in
premiums or payments due thereunder.

related to the Transferred Business, the Restructuring Sellers, contribute to
or have any obligation to contribute to, or any liability with respect to, any

applicable Laws.

  

  

(i) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor any of the transactions

any additional or subsequent events): (i) entitle any current or former

the amount of compensation due to any such individual; (iii) limit or restrict

(v) adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution,
restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization or alter the corporate
structure of the Acquired Companies;

  

  

 

29   

 

  

(vi) take any other action that, if taken between the date of the Interim
Balance Sheet and the Execution Date, would be required to be set forth in
_Section 3.8_ or _Section 3.15(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter; or

  

  

(vii) agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

  

  

 _Section 5.3 __Confidentiality_.

  

  

(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller will, and will cause each of
its Affiliates and its and their Representatives (its " _Restricted Persons_
") to, maintain the confidentiality of, and not use Confidential Information
for their own benefit or the benefit of any other Person.

  

  

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any Seller will, and the Purchaser and each
Seller will cause each of their respective Restricted Persons not to, disclose
to any Person any information with respect to the legal, financial or other
terms or conditions of this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The foregoing does not
restrict the right of any party to disclose such information (i) to its
respective Restricted Persons to the extent reasonably required in the
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or as required for
internal business purposes, (ii) to any Governmental Authority to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any Proceeding relating to the
enforcement of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and (iii) as
required by the rules of any stock exchange or any applicable Law, subject in
any event to _Section 5.4_. Each party will advise its respective Restricted
Persons with respect to the confidentiality obligations under this _Section
5.3_ and will be responsible for any breach or violation of such obligations
by its Restricted Persons.

  

  

(c) If a party or any of its respective Restricted Persons become legally
compelled, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, to make any disclosure
that is prohibited or otherwise restricted by this Agreement, then such party
will (i) take all reasonable steps to preserve the privileged nature and
confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including requesting that the
Confidential Information not be disclosed to non-parties or the public, (ii)
promptly notify the disclosing party in writing so that the disclosing party
may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective order or
other remedy, and (iii) consult with and assist the disclosing party, at the
disclosing party\'s sole cost and expense, in obtaining an injunction or other
appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, such party (or such other
persons to whom such request is directed) will furnish only that portion of
the Confidential Information which, on the advice of its legal counsel, is
legally required to be disclosed and, upon the disclosing party\'s request,
use its best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such information.

  

  

(d) To the extent that any Seller has not done so prior to the Closing, each
Seller will, immediately following the Closing, surrender to the Acquired
Companies or destroy all data, documents, records, databases, specifications,
customer lists, financial reports and all other tangible embodiments of, or
otherwise containing or reflecting, Confidential Information, it being
expressly understood that all these writings, tangible embodiments and other
things are the exclusive property of the Acquired Companies; _provided_ ,
that, subject to the other limitations in this _Section 5.3_ , each Seller may
retain copies of the foregoing solely to the extent required for (and solely
for the purpose of) regulatory and backup purposes.

  

  

 _Section 5.4 __Public Announcements_. The Purchaser and the Sellers will
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon, that portion of any press release or other public
statement that relates to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, and will not (and will cause their respective
Restricted Persons not to) issue any such press release or make any such
public statement before obtaining written consent from the non-issuing party,
except (i) as may be required by applicable Law, including, without
limitation, any and all rules and regulations promulgated by the New York
Stock Exchange or the SEC (based upon the reasonable advice of counsel), court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system or (ii) for
disclosures to their respective officers, directors, managers, members,
managing members, partners, employees, consultants, fiduciaries, financial
sponsors, limited partners, co-investors, agents or Representatives. The
Purchaser and the Sellers will consult with each other concerning the means by
which the employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with the
Acquired Companies will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Purchaser has the right to be present for any such
communication.

  

  

 

30   

 

  

 _Section 5.5 __Further Assurances_. Subject to the other express provisions
of this Agreement, upon the reasonable request of any party to this Agreement,
the other parties will (a) furnish to the requesting party any additional
information, (b) execute and deliver, at their own expense, any other
documents, and (c) take any other actions as the requesting party may
reasonably require to more effectively carry out the intent of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, upon request from the Purchaser or its Representatives, the Sellers
will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Purchaser and its Representatives in connection with the Purchaser\'s
preparation and filing of combined financial statements of the Acquired
Companies that meet the requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and other
applicable Law at the sole expense of the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event will the foregoing require any Seller (or Acquired Company)
to prepare or otherwise provide any financial statements with respect to any
historical financial information of any Seller or Acquired Company.

  

  

 _Section 5.6 __Pre-_ _Closing Transactions_.

  

  

(a) _Restructuring_. No later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Sellers will deliver to the Purchaser the drafts of the
Restructuring Agreements, with all proposed schedules, based on the form
attached as _Exhibit C_. The Purchaser will review such drafts and will
deliver to the Sellers any comments thereto within five Business Days
following receipt thereof. The Sellers will consider all such comments in good
faith; _provided_ , that the Sellers agree not to enter into any Restructuring
Agreements that include any material changes from the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_ without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which such
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Subject to the foregoing, the
Sellers will perform the Restructuring and all actions contemplated or carried
out thereby in compliance with applicable Law, in accordance with the
Restructuring Agreements, without waiver of any conditions set forth therein,
and otherwise in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.

  

  

(b) _Elimination of Account Payables and Receivables with Certain other
Persons_. Prior to the Closing (and before any determination of the Net
Working Capital), except as otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, the
Sellers will, and will cause each of the Acquired Companies (and its
applicable Affiliates with respect to any Transferred Business) to, fully
cancel, satisfy and otherwise eliminate all accounts payable, accounts
receivable and any other obligations between certain identified other Persons,
on the one hand, and any of the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, as set
forth in _Section 5.6(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(c) _Share Transfers_. Prior to the Closing, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties in writing, the Sellers will use reasonable best efforts to effect the
transfer of the following: (i) the shares of Alpha Mexico Network Power held
by Alpha Assets Ltd. to Alpha Technology Services Ltd.; (ii) the shares of
Riverfront Holdings held by Alpha Assets Ltd. to Alpha Technology Services
Ltd; (iii) the equity of Alpha China held by AlphaTec to EnerSys Holdings
Luxembourg Sarl; and (iv) the equity of TCS Hong Kong held by Charles Tan to
EnerSys Holdings Luxembourg Sarl. For the avoidance of doubt, completion of
the foregoing transfers in clauses (i)-(iii) will not be a condition to the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the completion of
the transfer of the equity of TCS Hong Kong described in clause (iv) above
will be a condition to Closing (it being acknowledged and agreed that such
condition will relate to the execution and delivery of the requisite share
transfer conveyance instrument, and not the completion of any registration or
other formalities as may be required under applicable Law).

  

  

 

31   

 

  

 _Section 5.7 __Consents and Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  

  

(a) The parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective in the most expeditious manner possible the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate such
transactions, (ii) taking all actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating
with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any third Person, including any Governmental
Authority (which actions will include furnishing all information required
under the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Laws required to be
obtained or made by any party or its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out fully the
purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, the parties will each use their
respective reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to this
Agreement and will not take any action after the date of this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result
in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any such
Governmental Authority or third Person required to be obtained prior to the
Closing.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the parties will keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required consents, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions
by, any Governmental Authorities, including by working cooperatively in
connection with any sales, divestitures or dispositions of assets or
businesses if and to the extent undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 5.7(b)_. In this regard, prior to the Closing, each party will
promptly consult with the other parties to provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties
(or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement. Each party will promptly inform the other parties, and if in
writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in the case of material
oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any communication
from any Governmental Authorities regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the other parties to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed oral)
communication with any such Governmental Authority. If any party or any
Representative of such party receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will use its
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request. The Purchaser will not participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement (or make oral
submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it
consults with the Sellers in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, gives the Sellers the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Each party will furnish the other parties with copies of
all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement, and furnish the other parties with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions
of information to any such Governmental Authority.

  

  

 

32   

 

  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable but in any event
no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
notifications under the HSR Act, and the parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable, any other filings
or notifications under any other applicable Competition Laws. In the event
that the parties receive a formal request for additional information or
documentary materials after an initial notification pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Competition Law (a " _Second Request_ "), the parties will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable and counsel for the parties will
closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process.

  

  

(d) The parties will use their respective best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act
or any other applicable Competition Law. In connection therewith, if any
Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violating the HSR Act or any
other applicable Competition Law, the parties will cooperate and use their
respective best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Proceeding,
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Judgment, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including by pursuing vigorously all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.7(d)_ will limit the
right of any party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_ , so
long as such party has, up to the time of termination, complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.7_ and the rest
of this Agreement. Each of the parties will use its respective reasonable best
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser will
take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired
Companies or the Purchaser and its subsidiaries and Affiliates and (ii)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit the Purchaser\'s or its Affiliates\' freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Sellers or the Purchaser and its Affiliates, in
each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction, in any Proceeding
under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchaser will in
no event be required to undertake or agree to undertake any such remedial
action that is reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the
business or financial condition of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, taken as
a whole.

  

  

(f) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and Affiliates to not, acquire or
agree to acquire any business or assets, or take or agree to take any other
action, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the parties from
obtaining any Governmental Authorization in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or to prevent or materially delay or impede
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.

  

  

 

33   

 

  

(g) The Purchaser agrees to provide such security and assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Authority or other third Person whose consent or
approval is sought in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Whether or not the Closing occurs, the Purchaser will be
responsible for all fees and payments (including filing fees and legal and
professional fees) to any third Person or any Governmental Authority in order
to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser will not be responsible for any of the
foregoing fees and payments with respect to any Seller in connection with any
Second Request, in which case, each party will be responsible for the fees of
and payments to its own legal and professional advisors.

  

  

 _Section 5.8 __Employees_.

  

  

(a) For the one-year period commencing on the Closing Date (or such longer
period as may be required by any applicable Law), the Purchaser will provide,
or cause the Acquired Companies or its other Affiliate to provide, to each
Person employed by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing,
including those employees on vacation, leave of absence, disability (including
long-term disability), military, parental or sick leave or layoff
(collectively, the " _Transferred Employees_ "), with employee benefits that
in the aggregate are comparable to, in the aggregate, those provided to
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the
Closing Date.

  

  

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or
vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than
equity-based and incentive compensation plans or programs) established or
maintained by the Purchaser for the benefit of Transferred Employees, such
plan, program or arrangement will credit such employees or former employees
for service on or prior to the Closing with the Acquired Companies and their
Affiliates.

  

  

(c) Upon the Closing Date, the Purchaser will honor or cause the Acquired
Companies to honor in accordance with its terms each Company Plan set forth on
_Section 3.17(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter that is an individual
employment, severance, retention or other compensation agreement between the
Acquired Companies and any employee thereof, except as otherwise agreed in
writing by the Purchaser and such Person.

  

  

(d) Subject to _Section 5.8(a)_ above, with respect to the Acquired
Companies\' plans maintained by the Acquired Companies or its Affiliates and
set forth on _Section 3.17(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Welfare
Plans_ "), the Purchaser agrees to maintain, designate or establish one or
more benefit plans, programs or arrangements for the purpose of providing such
benefits to Transferred Employees. The Purchaser or its Affiliate will cause
such benefit plans, programs or arrangements to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations for conditions covered under the applicable Welfare
Plans available to the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing
and any applicable waiting periods to the extent such waiting periods were
waived under the equivalent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) credit Transferred Employees with any deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their dependents under the
Welfare Plans during the portion of 2018 preceding the Closing Date for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any similar plan, program or arrangement in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Closing Date.

  

  

 

34   

 

  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto and nothing in this _Section 5.8_ , express or implied, will
confer upon any Transferred Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section
5.8_ , express or implied, will be (i) deemed an amendment of any plan
providing benefits to any Transferred Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent
the Purchaser or its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or
in any respect any employee benefit plan that the Purchaser or its Affiliates
may establish or maintain.

  

  

(f) The Acquired Companies will (a) use reasonable best efforts to secure from
any Person who is a "disqualified individual" as defined in Section 280G of
the Code, and who has a right to any payments or benefits or potential right
to any payments or benefits in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein that could be deemed to constitute "parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, a waiver of such Person\'s
rights to any such payments or benefits applicable to such Person to the
extent that all remaining payments or benefits applicable to such Person will
not be deemed to be "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
(the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") and (b) if such waiver is secured, submit for
approval by the shareholders of the Seller, the Waived 280G Benefits, to the
extent and in the manner required by Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. The Acquired Companies will not, and the Purchaser
will not be required to, pay any of the Waived 280G Benefits if such payment
is not approved by the shareholders of the Seller as contemplated above. Prior
to obtaining such waivers, and prior to seeking such stockholder approval, the
Acquired Companies will provide drafts of such waivers and such stockholder
approval materials to the Purchaser for its reasonable review and consider in
good faith any comments that the Purchaser may provide thereon. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Acquired Companies will deliver to the Purchaser evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser that (x) a vote of the shareholders
of the Seller was received in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations thereunder, or (y) such requisite stockholder approval has not
been obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits, and, as a consequence,
the Waived 280G Benefits have not been and will not be made or provided.

  

  

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, to complete the actions set forth in
_Section 5.8(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

 _Section 5.9 __Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the Execution Date
through the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1_ , none of the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or the
Restructuring Sellers (with respect to the Transferred Business) will take or
permit any other Person on its behalf to take any action to consummate,
encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to, any Person (other than the Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s
Representatives) concerning any purchase of the Shares, any merger involving
the Acquired Companies or the Restructuring Sellers (with respect to the
Transferred Business), any sale of substantially all of the assets of the
Acquired Companies, or other similar transaction involving the Acquired
Companies or the Restructuring Sellers (with respect to the Transferred
Business) (in each case, other than assets sold in the Ordinary Course of
Business in accordance with _Section 5.2_ ). In addition, promptly following
the Execution Date, the Sellers, the Acquired Companies and the Restructuring
Sellers will take such actions as may be necessary in order to require the
return or destruction of any information relating to the Acquired Companies or
the Restructuring Sellers previously provided to any Person (other than the
Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s Representatives) with respect to any such
potential transaction.

  

  

 

35   

 

  

 _Section 5.10 __Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.

  

  

(a) For a period of five years commencing on the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), each Seller will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business anywhere in the world; (ii) have an
interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted
Business anywhere in the world in any capacity, including as a partner,
shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or
(iii) intentionally interfere in any material respect with the business
relationships (whether formed prior to or after the date of this Agreement)
between the Acquired Companies or the Restructuring Sellers and customers or
suppliers of the Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities
of any Person traded on any national securities exchange if the Sellers, in
the aggregate, are not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which
controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of
any class of securities of such Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing will not apply to securities issued by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

  

  

(b) During the Restricted Period, each Seller will not, and will not permit
any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee
of an Acquired Company or encourage any such employee to leave such employment
or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.10(b)_ will prevent
such Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose
employment has been terminated by an Acquired Company, Restructuring Seller or
the Purchaser or (ii) after 180 days from the date of termination of
employment, any employee whose employment has been terminated by the employee.

  

  

(c) During the Restricted Period, each Seller will not, and will not permit
any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or entice, or
attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of an Acquired Company
or potential clients or customers of an Acquired Company for purposes of
diverting their business or services from such Acquired Company.

  

  

(d) Each Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
_Section 5.10_ would give rise to irreparable harm to the Purchaser, for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in
the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such
obligations, the Purchaser will, in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

  

  

(e) Each Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
5.10_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
Purchaser and constitute a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In the
event that any covenant contained in this _Section 5.10_ should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant will be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this _Section 5.10_ and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written will not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

 _Section 5.11 __Physical Inventory_. The Purchaser and the Sellers will
jointly conduct a physical review and inspection of all inventory of the
Acquired Companies at pre-determined locations (the " _Inventory Inspection_
"), for the purpose of establishing a baseline for Purchaser\'s inventory
analysis of the Acquired Companies post-Closing and to calculate any necessary
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.3_. The parties will
work together in good faith, and use commercially reasonably efforts, to
conduct such Inventory Inspection as expeditiously as possible, in the five
days (including weekends, if applicable) prior to the Closing Date. The
parties will cooperate and jointly prepare a joint analysis setting forth all
of the Acquired Companies\' inventory on hand at Closing, including (i) part
number, (ii) description, (iii) number of units, (iv) cost, (v) whether of a
quality and quantity useable in the Ordinary Course of Business and (vi) with
respect to all finished goods, whether such finished goods are suitable for
resale in the Ordinary Course of Business, slow moving, excess or obsolete.
For the avoidance of doubt "obsolete" inventory will be inventory items that
were not sold or used in production in the last 12 months.

effect as though made at and as of such date (except to the extent any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser speaks as of any other specific
date, in which case such representation or warranty will have been true and
correct in all material respects as of such date), except for such failures to

ARTICLE 7 
  CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  

  

 _Section 7.1 __Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. To the extent permitted
or required, the taxable year of each of the Acquired Companies that includes
the Closing Date will close as of the end of the Closing Date. Whenever it is
necessary to allocate the liability for Taxes that are payable by or with
respect to the Acquired Companies for any Straddle Period, the portion of any
such Tax that is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date will be:

  

  

(a) in the case of Taxes that are not described in _Section 7.1(b)_ hereof
(such as (i) Taxes based on income or receipts, (ii) Taxes imposed in
connection with the sale or other transfer or assignment of property
(including all sales and use Taxes) other than Transfer Taxes (as defined
below), and (iii) withholding and employment Taxes), deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the taxable period of the Acquired Companies
ended with and included the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) will be allocated between
the period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period;

  

  

(b) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Acquired Companies (such as real property Taxes
or other ad valorem Taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire period.

  

  

 

38   

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
allocations in respect of any Straddle Period of the Acquired Companies
pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ and _Section 7.1(b)_ above will be made without
taking into account any items related to any assets and liabilities acquired
pursuant to any Restructuring Agreement.

  

  

 _Section 7.2 __Tax Returns_.

  

  

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_. The Sellers
will, at the Sellers\' sole cost and expense, prepare (or cause to be
prepared) all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any
Acquired Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Period that have a Due Date
after the Closing Date. All such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns will be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice employed by the applicable
Acquired Company, except as required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Canadian federal income Tax Returns of ATL for the Pre-Closing
Period otherwise ending immediately prior to the Closing Date may, at the
Purchaser\'s option, include an election under subsection 256(9) of the ITA.
The Sellers will deliver drafts of each such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return to
the Purchaser for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the Due Date of
such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. If the Purchaser disputes any item on such
Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, the Purchaser will notify the Seller
Representative (by written notice within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such
draft Pre-Closing Period Tax Return) of such disputed item (or items), the
basis for its objection, and proposed revisions to such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return, and any dispute will be resolved (and such Tax Returns filed) pursuant
to the provisions of _Section 7.2(c)_ below. No later than three Business Days
prior to the earlier of the Due Date of a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return or the
date such Tax Return is filed, the Sellers will pay (in immediately available
funds) to the Purchaser the amount of all Seller Taxes required to be paid
with respect to such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return (determined pursuant to
this _Section 7.2(a)_ but subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ ).

  

  

(b) _Preparation and Filing of Straddle Period Tax Returns_. The Purchaser
will, at its sole cost and expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Straddle Period Tax Returns required to be
filed by or on behalf of each Acquired Company. All Straddle Period Tax
Returns will be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the
past practice employed by the applicable Acquired Company, except as required
by applicable Law. The Purchaser will deliver drafts of any such Straddle
Period Tax Return to the Seller Representative for review and comment, and
will notify the Seller Representative of the Purchaser\'s calculation of the
Sellers\' share of the Taxes of the Acquired Companies for such Straddle
Period (determined in accordance with _Section 7.1_ ), at least 30 days prior
to the Due Date of such Straddle Period Tax Return. If the Seller
Representative disputes any item on such Straddle Period Tax Return, or
Purchaser\'s calculation of the Sellers\' share of the Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for such Straddle Period (determined in accordance with _Section
7.1_ ), the Seller Representative will notify the Purchaser (by written notice
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Straddle Period Tax Return and
calculation) of such disputed item (or items), the basis for its objection,
and proposed revisions to such Straddle Period Tax Return, and any dispute
(and the filing of such Tax Return) will be resolved pursuant to the provision
of _Section 7.2(c)_. If the Seller Representative does not object by written
notice within such period, such draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return and
calculation of Sellers\' share of Taxes for such Straddle Period will be
deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for
purposes of this _Section 7.2(b)_. No later than three Business Days prior to
the earlier of the Due Date of a Straddle Period Tax Return or the date such
Straddle Period Tax Return is filed, the Sellers will pay (in immediately
available funds) to the Purchaser the amount of all Seller Taxes required to
be paid with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return (determined pursuant
to this _Section 7.2(b)_ but subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ below).

  

  

 

39   

 

  

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. The Purchaser and the Sellers will act in good faith
to resolve any dispute prior to the Due Date of any Tax Return prepared
pursuant to this _Section 7.2_.

  

  

(i) If the Purchaser and the Sellers cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question will be resolved by a nationally recognized law firm
experienced in Tax matters (the " _Tax Law Firm_ "), which Tax Law Firm will
be mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the Sellers. The Purchaser and the
Sellers will jointly and reasonably determine the scope of the engagement with
the Tax Law Firm pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)(i)_. The Tax Law Firm will
resolve any disputed items in favor of the Tax treatment proposed to be taken
by the Sellers with respect to such disputed item (" _Sellers\' Tax Position_
"), if the Tax Law Firm concludes that (A) it is at least "more likely than
not" that Sellers\' Tax Position would prevail, or (B) Sellers\' Tax Position
is a Substantial Authority Position, subject to the Substantial Authority
Position Cap. The Tax Law Firm will render its final determination in writing
no later than 90 days after the Due Date of the applicable Tax Return, which
final determination will meet the requirements for written advice under §10.37
Treasury Department Circular No. 230, will be addressed to the Purchaser and
the applicable Acquired Company, and the Purchaser and the applicable Acquired
Company will be entitled to rely upon such written final determination. Except
to the extent provided in _Section 7.2(d)_ , the Tax Law Firm\'s written
determination will be binding upon the parties.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ , in the
event that the Tax Law Firm has not delivered its written final determination
as described in _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ by the applicable Due Date, the Purchaser
will file or cause to be filed the applicable Tax Return in such manner as the
Purchaser reasonably determines, and if a written final determination pursuant
to and as described in _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ from the Tax Law Firm is delivered
after the Due Date of such applicable Tax Return (but within 90 days of the
Due Date of such applicable Tax Return), the Purchaser will, at its election,
either (x) amend (or cause to be amended) such Tax Return to the extent
necessary to conform to the Tax Law Firm\'s final determination, or (y)
without actually filing such amended Tax Return, agree that any payment
obligations between the parties in connection with this Agreement will be
determined as though such amended Tax Return had been so filed.

  

  

(iii) The fees and expenses of the Tax Law Firm will be allocated between the
Sellers and the Purchaser as follows: (A) 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the
Sellers with respect to the fees and expenses related to any disputed item to
the extent the Tax Law Firm concludes that the Sellers\' Tax Position with
respect to such disputed item meets at least the "substantial authority"
standard (as defined under Section 6662 of the Code (or successor provisions
thereof)), and (B) 100% by the Sellers with respect to the fees and expenses
related to any disputed item to the extent the Tax Law Firm concludes that the
Sellers\' Tax Position with respect to such disputed item does not meet at
least the "substantial authority" standard (as defined under Section 6662 of
the Code (or successor provisions thereof)).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_ to
the contrary, in connection with a disputed item (or items) relating to a Tax
Return of an Acquired Company to be filed pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ for which the Sellers have provided to the Purchaser a MLTN
Tax Opinion prior to the Due Date of the applicable Tax Return with respect to
such disputed item (or items), the Purchaser agrees to file such Tax Return in
a manner consistent with such MLTN Tax Opinion, regardless of the final
determination of the Tax Law Firm, _provided_ , _further_ , that, in
connection with a disputed item (or items) relating to a Tax Return of an
Acquired Company to be filed pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
for which the Sellers have provided to the Purchaser a Substantial Authority
Tax Opinion prior to the Due Date of the applicable Tax Return with respect to
such disputed item (or items), the Purchaser agrees to file such Tax Return in
a manner consistent with such Substantial Authority Tax Opinion, regardless of
the final determination of the Tax Law Firm, but subject to the Substantial
Authority Position Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, if the Sellers have not provided a MLTN Tax Opinion or Substantial
Authority Tax Opinion prior to the Due Date of an applicable Tax Return but
thereafter and within 90 days of the Due Date of such applicable Tax Return,
the Sellers provide to Purchaser a MLTN Tax Opinion or Substantial Authority
Tax Opinion, then the Purchaser will, at its election, either (x) amend (or
cause to be amended) such Tax Return in a manner consistent with such MLTN Tax
Opinion or Substantial Authority Tax Opinion subject to the Substantial
Authority Position Cap, as the case may be, or (y) without actually filing
such amended Tax Return, agree that any payment obligations between the
parties in connection with this Agreement will be determined as though such
amended Tax Return had been so filed, regardless of the determination of the
Tax Law Firm.

  

  

 

40   

 

  

 _Section 7.3 __Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all Tax Returns with respect to transfer, documentary, recording,
notarial, sales, use, registration, stamp and other similar Taxes or fees
imposed by any Governmental Authority (such Taxes, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for
any Transfer Taxes related to the transactions contemplated pursuant to
_Section 5.6_ or the Restructuring Agreements), if any, will be prepared and
filed by the Purchaser, and the Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation if
required by applicable Law. Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser will
cooperate as reasonably requested by the other party to establish any
available exemption from (or otherwise reduce) any such Transfer Taxes, and
the Purchaser will bear and pay, or promptly reimburse the Sellers for, all
such Transfer Taxes, subject to the first sentence of this _Section 7.3_. For
the avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes related to the transaction
contemplated pursuant to _Section 5.6_ or the Restructuring Agreements will be
borne and paid solely by the Sellers.

  

  

 _Section 7.4 __Cooperation_. The Sellers and the Purchaser will cooperate,
and will cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and Representatives to cooperate, to provide each other with such
assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
cooperation in connection with any MLTN Tax Opinion or Substantial Authority
Tax Opinion sought by the Sellers), or any audit or other examination in
connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding involving a
Governmental Authority relating to Taxes of the Acquired Companies, and the
enforcement of the provisions of this _ARTICLE 7_. Such cooperation will
include, upon the request of the Sellers or the Purchaser, as the case may be,
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters and making employees (including those of the Acquired Companies)
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information.

  

  

 _Section 7.5 __Post-_ _Closing Actions_. Except as otherwise specifically
contemplated pursuant to this Agreement or as required by applicable Law,
after the Closing, the Purchaser will not, without the prior written consent
of the Sellers (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), cause or permit an Acquired Company to (i) file or amend any Tax
Return that relates in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle
Period, or (ii) take any other action solely with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (other
than any action on the Closing Date after the Closing that is in the Ordinary
Course of Business), in each case, if such amendment or action could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of increasing the Tax Liability for
which Sellers are responsible under this Agreement or decreasing any Tax
refund to which Sellers are entitled under this Agreement.

  

  

 

41   

 

  

 _Section 7.6 __Tax Refunds_. The Sellers will be entitled to any refunds of
Taxes paid by the Acquired Companies that relate to any Pre-Closing Period or
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (to be equitably
apportioned between the Purchaser and the Sellers in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 7.1_ ) (whether in the form of cash refund
received, or a credit in lieu of such refund or offset against Taxes otherwise
payable (solely to the extent that such credit in lieu of or offset against
Taxes is used to reduce Taxes of an Acquired Company for a taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date)), including any interest
received from a Governmental Authority with respect thereto, that are actually
received by the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies, in each case, net of any
Tax Liabilities or increase in Tax Liabilities imposed on the Purchaser, the
Acquired Companies, or any of their Affiliates resulting from such refund;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers will not be entitled to any refund
to the extent such refund (x) relates to the carryback of a Tax attribute from
any period ending after the Closing Date, (y) is required to be paid over by
any Acquired Company to any Person under any provision of any contract to
which such Person was a party prior to the Closing or (z) relates to the
payment of Taxes by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing
Date to the extent the Purchaser was not previously indemnified or otherwise
reimbursed for such Taxes. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for any Tax period (or portion of any Tax period) beginning after
the Closing Date will be for the account of the Purchaser. The Purchaser will
be entitled to any refund relating to Transfer Taxes. Each party will pay, and
will cause its Affiliates to pay, to the Person entitled to receive a refund
of Tax pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ the amount of such refund (i) within 30
days after such amount is received, or (ii) when used by a party or any of its
Affiliates to credit an account with a Taxing Authority or otherwise used to
offset any Taxes otherwise payable (solely to the extent that such credit in
lieu of or offset against Taxes is used to reduce Taxes of an Acquired Company
for a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date)
within 30 days after such credit to such account or such offset, in each case,
net of any reasonable third Person costs incurred by such party or its
Affiliates in procuring such refund. In the event that any refund that is paid
over by a party pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ is subsequently disallowed or
required to be returned to the applicable Taxing Authority, the other party
will promptly repay to the party the amount of such refund, together with any
interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Taxing
Authority.

  

  

 _Section 7.7 __Tax Contest_.

  

  

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller Representative will notify (" _Tax Claim
Notice_ ") the other in writing within 15 Business Days after receipt by
either party of any written notice from any Taxing Authority of any Tax
Contest, _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of one party to give such
notice to such other party will not relieve the other party of its
indemnification obligations under this Agreement except to the extent, if any,
that such party has been actually prejudiced thereby.

  

  

 

(b) Within 15 Business Days after the Seller Representative\'s receipt of a
Tax Claim Notice relating to a Pre-Closing Period of an Acquired Company, the
Seller Representative may, by written notice to the Purchaser, elect to assume
the defense of such Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
Representative will not be entitled to control (or retain control of) the
defense of such Tax Contest if the Indemnification Escrow Amount (or the then
available portion of such Indemnification Escrow Amount, after deducting
therefrom the aggregate amount of any and all pending or previously paid
claims under the Escrow Agreement) is reasonably expected to be less than 50%
of the amount of the claim or assessment asserted in writing by any Taxing
Authority (as quantified by such Taxing Authority at the onset of such Tax
claim or at any point during such Tax Contest with such Taxing Authorities) in
such Tax Contest. If the Seller Representative timely and properly elects to
assume the defense of a Tax Contest related to a Pre-Closing Period pursuant
to _Section 7.7(b)_ , the Seller Representative will (i) bear its own costs
and expenses (on behalf of the Sellers), (ii) keep the Purchaser reasonably
informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Contest
(including promptly forwarding copies to the Purchaser of any related
correspondence, and providing the Purchaser with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before sending it to any Taxing
Authority), (iii) consult with the Purchaser in connection with the defense or
prosecution of any such Tax Contest and the negotiation and settlement of any
Tax claim, and (iv) provide such cooperation and information as the Purchaser
will reasonably request, and the Purchaser will have the right, at its own
expense, to participate in (but not control) the defense or prosecution of
such Tax Contest (including participating in any discussions with the
applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Tax Contest), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller Representative will not settle or compromise (or
take any other actions with respect to) such Tax Contest without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

 

42   

 

 

  

(c) The Purchaser will control the defense of any Tax Contest that (i) the
Seller Representative fails to properly or timely elect to control or cannot
elect to control (or loses its right to control) pursuant to _Section 7.7(b)_
_,_ or (ii) relates to a Straddle Period; and the Seller Representative will
cooperate with the Purchaser in pursuing the defense of such Tax Contest. The
Sellers will reimburse the Purchaser for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Purchaser relating to any Tax Contest described in _Section
7.7(b)_ that Seller Representative would have been permitted to control under
_Section 7.7(b)_ but did not elect (or failed to properly or timely elect) to
control; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Purchaser will bear its own
costs and expenses relating to any Tax Contest described in _Section 7.7(b)_
if the Seller Representative loses its right to control such Tax Contest under
_Section 7.7(b)_ (or would have lost its right to control such Tax Contest
under _Section 7.7(b)_ if Seller Representative had elected to control such
Tax Contest) as a result of insufficient Indemnification Escrow Amount as
provided in _Section 7.7(b)_ , and (ii) the Purchaser will bear its own costs
and expenses relating to any other Tax Contests described in this _Section
7.7(c)_. In connection with any Tax Contest that is described in this _Section
7.7(c)_ and controlled by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will (i) keep the
Seller Representative informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Contests (including promptly forwarding copies to the
Seller Representative of any related correspondence, and providing the Seller
Representative with an opportunity to review and comment on any material
correspondence before sending it to any Taxing Authority), and (ii) consult
with the Seller Representative in the negotiation and settlement of any such
Tax Contest. The Seller Representative may participate in (but not control)
the conduct of such Tax Contests at its own expense (on behalf of the
Sellers), and the Purchaser will not settle or compromise any such Tax Contest
described in this _Section 7.7(c)_ without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _ARTICLE 8_ to the contrary, the procedures
set forth in this _Section 7.7_ will exclusively govern the conduct of any Tax
Contests relating to the Acquired Companies.

  

  

 _Section 7.8 __Conduct of_ _Business with respect to Taxes_. During the
period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies will
(and Sellers will cause each Acquired Company to):

  

  

(a) (i) timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them and all such
Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, (ii) timely pay all Taxes due and
payable, and (iii) promptly notify the Purchaser of any income, franchise or
similar (or other material) Tax claim, investigation or audit pending against
or with respect to each of the Acquired Companies in respect of any Tax
matters (or any significant developments with respect to ongoing Tax matters),
including material Tax Liabilities and material Tax refund claims; and

  

  

(b) unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Purchaser (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), not to take any of
the following actions: (i) make, revoke or amend any Tax election; (ii) change
any annual accounting period; (iii) adopt or change any method of accounting
or reverse any accruals (except as required by a change in Law or GAAP); (iv)
file any amended Tax Returns; (v) sign or enter into any closing agreement or
settlement agreement with respect to any, or compromise any, claim or
assessment of Tax liability; (vi) surrender any right to claim a refund,
offset or other reduction in liability; or (vii) consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitations period applicable to any claim or assessment, in
each case, with respect to Taxes.

  

  

 

43

Affiliates will cause each of ATI and Altair to:

  

  

(a) file all Tax Returns required to be filed by it after the Closing;

  

  

(b) pay all Taxes due and payable by it, including all Taxes resulting from
the Restructuring; and

  

  

(c) retain or set aside an amount payable to it pursuant to the applicable
Restructuring Agreement to satisfy all of its Liabilities (including, but not
limited to, Liabilities resulting from the Restructuring and Taxes due), and
not dissolve (whether by liquidation, merger, conversion, or otherwise) prior
to the later of (i) the 5th anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the date
on which all of its respective Liabilities have been paid or appropriate
amounts have been set aside for the payment thereof.

of Losses, or to any court of competent jurisdiction, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Third Party Claims.

  

  

(i) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or demand, whether or
not involving a Proceeding, by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party will give the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice within 30 days following
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. Such Claim Notice will
describe the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the
amount of the damages claimed by the other Person, in each case to the extent
known to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or
deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability or
obligation under this Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
suffers actual Losses directly caused by the delay or other deficiency.

  

  

 

45   

 

  

(ii) Within 30 days after the Indemnified Party\'s delivery of a Claim Notice
under this _Section 8.3(b)_ , the Indemnifying Party may assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim by giving to the Indemnified Party written
notice of the intention to assume such defense with counsel of its choice that
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. An Indemnifying Party will
lose any previously acquired right to control the defense of any Third Party
Claim if for any reason the Indemnifying Party ceases to actively, competently
and diligently conduct the defense.

  

  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not able to, assume or
maintain control of the defense of a Third Party Claim in compliance with this
_Section 8.3(b)_ , the Indemnified Party will have the right to control the
defense of the Third Party Claim. The party not controlling the defense (the "
_Noncontrolling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense. The
party controlling the defense (the " _Controlling Party_ ") will reasonably
advise the Noncontrolling Party of the status of the Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and, with respect to any Third Party Claim, the Controlling
Party will consider in good faith recommendations made by the Noncontrolling
Party. The Noncontrolling Party will furnish the Controlling Party with such
information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Claim and related
Proceedings (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading
which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and will
otherwise cooperate with and assist in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(iv) If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party has the right to agree in good faith to any
compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, the
Third Party Claim with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). All amounts paid or
payable under such settlement or Judgment are Losses that the Indemnifying
Party owes to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 8_. If the
Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not enter into a settlement of, or the entry of any
Judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, except as set forth in this _Section 8.3(b)(iv)_. If
a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to
liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
and complete release of each Indemnified Party from any and all Liabilities in
connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to
accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party will give written
notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails
to timely consent to such firm offer within ten days after its receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third
Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party
as to such Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement
offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also
fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer
to settle such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an Indemnifying Party
assumes any defense of any claim for which an Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification hereunder, the expenses incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith, including legal costs and expenses, will not constitute
Losses for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount of Losses the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified for pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 8_.

  

  

 

46   

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.3_ , _Section
7.7_ will exclusively govern the conduct of any Tax Contests relating to the
Acquired Companies.

  

  

 _Section 8.4 __Survival_. All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate of instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be
performed at or prior to the Closing will survive the Closing and will expire
at 11:59 p.m. (Central time) on the date that is 18 months after the Closing
Date, other than (a) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
2.1_ (Organization and Good Standing), _Section 2.2_ (Authority and
Enforceability), _Section 2.3_ (Ownership), _Section 3.1_ (Organization and
Good Standing), _Section 3.2_ (Capitalization), _Section 4.1_ (Organization
and Good Standing), _Section 4.2_ (Authority and Enforceability), _Section
4.5_ (Sufficiency of Funds), and _Section 4.7_ (Capitalization and Ownership)
(collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), each of which will
survive until the date that is six years after the Closing Date, (b) the
specific indemnity for Seller Taxes in _Section 8.1(c)_ will survive the
Closing until the date that is four years after the Closing Date and (c) all
other covenants and agreements of the parties contained herein requiring
performance at or after the Closing, which will survive the Closing
indefinitely or, if there is an express period specified therein, for such
period explicitly specified therein and only to the extent of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims for indemnification asserted in good
faith and in writing in accordance with this _ARTICLE 8_ before expiration of
the applicable survival period will not thereafter be barred by the expiration
of the relevant representation or warranty and such claims will survive until
finally resolved.

  

  

 _Section 8.5 __Limitations on Liability_.

  

  

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, (i) except in the case of any
claim for fraud or criminal act(s) by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies,
or (ii) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations, any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Sellers\' representations
and warranties in this Agreement under _Section 8.1(a)_ will be satisfied
solely by recourse under, and will be exclusively limited to, payment from the
Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
Additionally, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to
indemnification for Losses from any Seller under _Section 8.1(a)_ (i) for any
Losses arising from a particular set of facts and circumstances totaling less
than $75,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Loss_ "), and (ii) unless and until the
aggregate Losses for which they would otherwise be liable exceed $750,000 (the
" _Deductible_ "), at which time the Sellers will be liable from the first
dollar of any such Loss, subject to the other limitations herein. Any De
Minimis Losses will be expressly excluded from counting towards the
Deductible. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Deductible will not apply to
claims relating to a (A) breach of the Fundamental Representations, (B) any
inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty pursuant to _Section
3.15_ (Tax Matters), (C) fraud or criminal act(s) by or on behalf of the
Acquired Companies or (D) with respect to any other claims for Losses under
_Section 8.1_.

  

  

(b) Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for aggregate
Losses from any Seller under _Section 8.1(b)_ (other than with respect to a
breach of _Section 8.1_ itself), _Sections_ _8.1(c)_ or _8.1(f)_ will be
satisfied solely by recourse under, and will be exclusively limited to,
payment from the Indemnity Escrow Account.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification
in excess of the Purchase Price for aggregate Losses from any Seller (i) for
fraud or criminal acts by or on behalf of any Seller or Acquired Company, (ii)
any inaccuracy in or breach of Fundamental Representations, or (iii) pursuant
to _Sections_ _8.1(d)-(e)_.

  

  

 

47   

 

  

(d) Losses relating to any fraud or criminal act(s) of, by or on behalf of any
party will neither be applied toward, nor limited by, the foregoing
limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification for any
Loss or alleged Loss to the extent (but solely to the extent) such Loss or
alleged Loss is taken into account in determining the Closing Net Debt,
Closing Working Capital, or the Closing Transaction Expenses and such amount
is included in the calculation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.3_ ).

  

  

(e) The Seller Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification for
Losses under _Section 8.2_ in excess of the Purchase Price.

  

  

(f) The Purchaser will not be entitled to be compensated more than once for
the same Losses suffered or incurred. The Purchaser will not under any
circumstances be entitled to indemnification pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(a)_
to the extent that any such item or matter for which indemnification is sought
under _Section 8.1(a)_ is disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Letter and then
only to the extent of the potential liability disclosed or (ii) pursuant to
_ARTICLE 8_ to the extent of any liability specifically accrued on, reserved
for or otherwise reflected in the Closing Statement which has been
specifically and to the extent taken into account in the calculation of the
Closing Net Debt, the Closing Working Capital or the Closing Transaction
Expenses, other than reserves, if any, relating to the matters set forth in
_Section 3.19_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of the Parties\' indemnification obligations under _ARTICLE 8_ , all of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or any certificate
or schedule that are qualified as to "material," "materiality," "material
respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or words of similar import or effect will
be deemed to have been made without any such qualification for purposes of
determining any inaccuracy or breach in any representation or warranty and the
amount of Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach
of any representation or warranty.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will any
Purchaser Indemnified Party be indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 8_ related to or arising from the amount, value or condition of any
Tax asset or attribute (e.g., net operating loss carry-forward or tax credit
carry-forward) generated or arising in any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date, of any Acquired Company or the ability
of the Purchaser or any Acquired Company to utilize any such Tax asset or
attribute after the Closing.

  

  

 _Section 8.6 __Insurance Proceeds_. The amount of any and all Losses for
which indemnification is provided pursuant to this _ARTICLE 8_ will be net of
any amounts of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto (net of any increase in premiums and costs of collection).

  

  

 _Section 8.7 __Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, other than (a)
claims for fraud or arising from any criminal act(s) by or on behalf of any of
the Acquired Companies, (b) claims arising out of any Ancillary Agreement, and
(c) as provided in _Section 10.10_ , (i) the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any matter arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be pursuant to the indemnification
obligations set forth in this _ARTICLE 8_ and, except to the extent the
Purchaser has asserted a claim for indemnification by giving a Claim Notice in
accordance with _Section 8.3_ prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in _Section 8.4_ , the Purchaser will have no remedy
against the Sellers for any breach of any provision of this Agreement and (ii)
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any matter
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in this _ARTICLE 8_ and,
except to the extent a Seller has asserted a claim for indemnification by
giving a Claim Notice in accordance with _Section 8.3_ prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 8.4_ , the Sellers
will have no remedy against the Purchaser for any breach of any provision of
this Agreement. In no event will the Sellers have any Liability for Losses to
the extent arising from the conduct of the Acquired Companies or its business
after the Closing, except for Losses resulting from any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Specified Tax Representations or Seller Taxes. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY
PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE 8_ FOR ANY
INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOST OPPORTUNITY OR LOST SALES) IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT OF THE
CONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE
NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT, IN
EACH CASE EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAYABLE BY AN INDEMNIFIED
PARTY TO A THIRD PARTY IN RESPECT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

  

  

 

48   

 

  

 _Section 8.8 __Purchase Price Adjustment_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Sellers and the Purchaser will treat any payment made to
an Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 8_ as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes, and will complete and file all Tax Returns
consistent with such treatment.

  

  

ARTICLE 9 
  TERMINATION

  

  

 _Section 9.1 __Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Sellers;

  

  

(b) by the Purchaser, (i) if there has been a material violation or breach by
the Sellers of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations under _Section 6.1_ at the Closing and such violation or breach
has not been waived by the Purchaser or, in the case of a covenant breach,
cured by the Sellers within ten days after written notice thereof from the
Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser is not then in material
breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions in _Section 6.1_
not to be satisfied, or (ii) if all of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2_ will have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_ , that such
conditions will have been capable of being satisfied as of the termination of
this Agreement) but the Closing will not have been consummated by the third
Business Day after the date on which the Closing should have occurred pursuant
to _Section 1.5_ and the Purchaser is ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing;

  

  

(c) by the Sellers, (i) if there has been a material violation or breach by
the Purchaser of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations under _Section 6.2_ at the Closing and such violation or breach
has not been waived by the Sellers or, in the case of a covenant breach, cured
by the Purchaser within ten days after written notice thereof by the Sellers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Sellers nor the Acquired Companies
are then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the
conditions in _Section 6.2_ not to be satisfied; or (ii) if all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ will have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing; _provided_ , that such conditions will have been capable of being
satisfied as of the termination of this Agreement) but the Closing will not
have been consummated by the third Business Day after the date on which the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and the Sellers are
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing; or

  

  

 

49   

 

  

(d) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers for any reason if the Closing has
not occurred by January 31, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing by the parties, or such later date as the parties
may agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party cannot terminate
under this provision if the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of
the failure on the part of such party to perform any of its obligations
hereunder (except the failure on the part of such party to satisfy a closing
condition over which such party has no control);

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_ , if as of the
Outside Date all of the conditions precedent to obligations of the Purchaser
set forth in _Section 6.1_ , other than the condition set forth in _Sections_
_6.1(d)_ and _6.2(d)_ and those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, have been satisfied, then each of the Sellers and
the Purchaser will have the right, exercisable by delivery of written notice
to the other party at least five Business Days prior to the Outside Date, to
extend the Outside Date to a date not later than March 31, 2019. Following the
exercise of such right by either party, all references to the Outside Date in
this Agreement will refer to the extended Outside Date set forth in the notice
delivered by the other party.

  

  

 _Section 9.2 __Effect of Termination_.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either the Purchaser
or the Sellers as provided above, the provisions of this Agreement will
immediately become void and of no further force or effect (other than the
provisions of _Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.3_ , _Section 5.4_ , this _Section
9.2_ and _ARTICLE 10_ (and any definitions contained in or applicable to any
such Section or Article), which will survive the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with their terms); _provided_ , that, nothing in this Agreement
will relieve any party hereto from liability for (i) failure to perform the
obligations set forth in _Section 5.3_ (Confidentiality), (ii) any fraud,
willful misconduct or criminal act or (iii) the taking of any action or the
failure to take any action with the knowledge or reckless disregard that such
act or failure to act would be a material breach of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that, in
lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ , _Section
9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_ , as applicable, either the Sellers or the
Purchaser may exercise their right under _Section 10.10_ to specifically
enforce the other parties\' obligation to consummate the Closing.

  

  

ARTICLE 10

 _Section 10.2 __Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified except in a written document signed by all of the
parties hereto and that identifies itself as an amendment to this Agreement.

  

  

 _Section 10.3 __Waiver and Remedies_. The parties may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party to this
Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
any other party to this Agreement contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or
(c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or
waiver by any party to this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in a
written document signed on behalf of the party or parties against whom the
waiver or extension is to be effective. No extension or waiver will apply to
any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or
noncompliance with any covenant, agreement or condition, as the case may be,
other than that which is specified in the written extension or waiver. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy under this
Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no
course of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver of such right or
remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy
precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy or the
exercise of any other right or remedy. Except as otherwise expressly set out
in this Agreement, any enumeration of a party\'s rights and remedies in this
Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party\'s rights and remedies
are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any
rights and remedies authorized in law or in equity.

  

  

 

51   

 

  

 _Section 10.4 __Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto, the Seller Disclosure Letter and the documents and
instruments referred to in this Agreement that are to be delivered at the
Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties,
or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

  

  

 _Section 10.5 __Assignment and Successors and No Third Person Rights_. This
Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. No party may assign any rights under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party, except for assignments to Affiliates for
which no consent is required. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any third Person, other than the parties
to this Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement except such
rights as may inure to a successor or permitted assignee under this _Section
10.5_ or the rights to indemnification that may inure to the parties specified
in _ARTICLE 8_.

  

  

 _Section 10.6 __Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in
any way and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such
invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and
enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this
Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision.

  

  

 _Section 10.7 __Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure Letter) are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part of this Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Letter is
arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections and paragraphs of _ARTICLES_ _2_ and _3_. The disclosure in any
section of the Seller Disclosure Letter qualifies as a disclosure in other
sections and paragraphs of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent
reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is applicable to another
section or paragraph of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

 _Section 10.8 __Interpretation_. In the negotiation of this Agreement, each
party has received advice from its own attorney. The language used in this
Agreement is the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against
any party because that party or its attorney drafted the provision.

  

  

 _Section 10.9 __Governing Law_. The internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and its Exhibits and Schedules and all of
the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation,
construction, performance and enforcement and any disputes or controversies
arising therefrom or related thereto.

  

  

 _Section 10.10 __Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. The parties accordingly agree that, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the parties are entitled to
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and otherwise to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement, both prior to and
following the Closing.

  

  

 

52   

 

  

 _Section 10.11 __Disputes._

  

  

(a) In the event of a dispute arising out of or in relation to this Agreement
(a " _Dispute_ "), any party to the Dispute may deliver a written dispute
notice to the other party to the Dispute. The written disputes notice will
refer to this clause and must contain reasonable details of the Dispute as
well as the Losses, if any, suffered by the party giving the written dispute
notice. The parties to a Dispute must, no later than ten Business Days after
delivery of the written dispute notice, hold a meeting (the " _Dispute
Meeting_ ") at which they must use all reasonable efforts to resolve the
Dispute in an amicable manner.

  

  

(b) In the Dispute, the Seller Representative will represent any and all
Sellers and the Chief Executive Officer or other executive authorized officer
of the Purchaser will represent the Purchaser, with each having sufficient
authority to conduct negotiations on behalf of the Sellers and the Purchaser,
respectively, and, if relevant, to settle the Dispute.

  

  

(c) Any Dispute which is not amicably resolved within 20 Business Days after
delivery of the written dispute notice will (regardless of whether or not a
Dispute Meeting has actually been held) at the request of any party to the
Dispute, be referred to non-binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules
of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The
place of arbitration will be Delaware. The language of the arbitration
Proceedings will be English. The Seller Representative will appoint one
arbitrator and the Purchaser will appoint one arbitrator and the two
arbitrators so appointed will agree on a third arbitrator, who will be the
chairman of the arbitration tribunal. If a party fails to appoint an
arbitrator or the two arbitrators appointed by the parties cannot agree on a
third arbitrator, in each case within 30 calendar days, then the relevant
arbitrator will be appointed subject to the rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect.

  

  

(d) On or before the 45th day following (and including) the date on which
third arbitrator was finally selected, the arbitrators will render a written
judgment with respect to each matter involved in the Dispute. Any award of the
arbitrators will be non-binding on the parties. The arbitrators will decide
all issues in dispute pursuant to applicable Law as specified in _Section
10.9_.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 10.11_ limits the right of a party to bring
Proceedings against another party in any court of competent jurisdiction upon
the conclusion of the arbitration procedures set forth in this _Section
10.11_.

  

  

(f) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to claim any
immunity from Proceedings brought by another party against it under this
_Section 10.11_ (and to ensure that no such claim is made on its behalf). Each
party hereby consents generally to the giving of any relief or the issue of
any process in connection with those Proceedings, and waives all rights of
immunity in respect of it or its assets.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this
_Section 10.11_ will not apply to disputes described in either _Section 1.3_
or _Section 7.2(c)_ of this Agreement, which will be resolved as specifically
provided therein.

  

  

 _Section 10.12 __Jurisdiction and Service of Process._ In any action or
Proceeding between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the
extent not subject to _Section 10.11_ ), each of the parties knowingly,
voluntarily and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of New
Castle County, Delaware, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the

 _Section 10.16 __Seller Representative_.

  

  

(a) By virtue of their execution of this Agreement, each Seller knowingly and
irrevocably designates and appoints the Seller Representative as such
Seller\'s exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement with full power and authority to act for and on behalf of
each Seller to give and receive notices and communications, to accept service
of process on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 8.3_ and _Section
10.12_ , to authorize and agree to any purchase price adjustments pursuant to
_Section 1.3_ and other applicable provisions of this Agreement and the other
documents delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement),
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with Judgments of courts or other Governmental Authorities and awards of
arbitrators, with respect to, any claims by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
against any Seller or by any Seller against any Purchaser Indemnified Party,
or any other dispute between any Purchaser Indemnified Party and any Seller,
in each case relating to this Agreement, the other documents delivered in
connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement) or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and to take all actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Seller Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement or the other documents delivered in connection herewith
(including the Escrow Agreement and Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Representative will have
no obligation to act on behalf of the Sellers, except as expressly provided
herein, in the Escrow Agreement, and in the Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Seller
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Seller
Disclosure Letter. The Seller Representative will be entitled to (A) rely upon
_Schedule I_ , (B) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and
(C) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on
behalf of the applicable Seller or other party. Notices or communications to
or from the Seller Representative constitute notice to or from each of the
Sellers for all purposes under this Agreement and the other documents
delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement), in each
case, whether entered into or taken before, on or after the date of such
designation and appointment of the Seller Representative.

  

  

 

54   

 

  

(b) In the event of the resignation of the Seller Representative, the death,
incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act of the
Seller Representative, or the termination of the Seller Representative by the
decision of the majority of Sellers, a successor Seller Representative will be
appointed promptly by the Sellers (upon prior written consent of the
Purchaser, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), such
appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by such
successor Seller Representative. Each successor Seller Representative has all
of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement
upon the original Seller Representative, and the term "Seller Representative"
as used in this Agreement includes any successor Seller Representative. The
immunities and rights to indemnification will survive the resignation or
removal of the Seller Representative or any member of the Advisor and the
Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(c) A decision, act, instruction or Consent of the Seller Representative under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the Representative Engagement
Agreement constitutes a decision, act, instruction or Consent of all the
Sellers and is final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller and such
Seller\'s successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified by such Seller,
and all defenses which may be available to any Seller to contest, negate or
disaffirm the action of the Seller Representative taken in good faith under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Representative Engagement
Agreement are waived. The Purchaser and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any
such decision, act, instruction or Consent of the Seller Representative as
being the decision, act, instruction or Consent of the Sellers. The Purchaser
is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done or
omissions by the Purchaser in accordance with such decision, act, instruction
or Consent of the Seller Representative.

  

  

(d) The relationship created herein is not to be construed as a joint venture
or any form of partnership between or among the Seller Representative or any
Seller for any purpose of U.S. federal or state Law, including federal, state
or foreign income Tax purposes. Neither the Seller Representative nor any of
its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to any Seller.

  

  

(e) Certain Sellers have entered into an engagement agreement (the " _Seller_
___Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Seller Representative to
provide direction to the Seller Representative in connection with its services
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Seller Representative
Engagement Agreement (the designated representative of the Sellers, being the
" _Advisor_ "). Neither the Seller Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor the Advisor
(collectively, the " _Seller Representative Group_ "), will be liable to any
Seller for any action or failure to act in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Seller Representative\'s responsibilities hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement or under the Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement, unless and only to the extent such action or failure to act
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Representative Group from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs,
expenses (including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the " _Seller
Representative Expenses_ ") incurred without gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Seller Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement or under the Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement. Such Seller Representative Expenses may be recovered first, from
the Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount otherwise distributable to the Sellers at the time of distribution, and
third, directly from the Sellers. The Sellers acknowledge that the Seller
Representative will not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any
of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Seller Representative Engagement Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Seller Representative will
not be required to take any action unless the Seller Representative has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are
sufficient to protect the Seller Representative against the costs, expenses
and liabilities which may be incurred by the Seller Representative in
performing such actions. Each of the Purchaser and its Affiliates acknowledge
that the Seller Representative is party to this Agreement solely for purposes
of serving as the "Seller Representative" hereunder, and no action, suit,
claim, investigation, or proceeding will be brought by, or on behalf of, the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates against the Seller Representative with
respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or any
statement, certificate, instruction, opinion, instrument or other documents
delivered hereunder (with it being understood that any covenant or agreement
of or by the "parties" or "each of the parties" will not be deemed to require
performance by, or be an agreement of, the Seller Representative unless
performance by the Seller Representative is expressly provided for in such
covenant or the Seller Representative expressly so agrees in writing).

  

  

 

55   

 

  

(f) This appointment and grant of power and authority by the Sellers to the
Seller Representative pursuant to this _Section 10.16_ is made in
consideration of the common interest of the Sellers and the Seller
Representative to facilitate the negotiation and completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(including any post-Closing actions) and is in consideration of the mutual
agreements and covenants made in this Agreement. Such appointment and grant of
power and authority, and the powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Seller Representative Group hereunder (i) are coupled with an
interest and will be irrevocable and may not be terminated by the act of any
Seller or by operation of Law, whether upon the death, incapacity, illness,
bankruptcy or dissolution of any Seller, or by the occurrence of any other
event and (ii) will survive the delivery of an assignment by any Seller of the
whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Indemnification
Escrow Amount.

  

  

(g) Upon the Closing, the Purchaser will wire to the Seller Representative
$100,000 (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ "). The Expense Fund Amount will be held
by the Seller Representative in a segregated client account and will be used
(i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Seller
Representative for any Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Seller Representative Engagement
Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisor (the " _Expense
Fund_ "). The Seller Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and will have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Seller Representative is
not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations. The Sellers will not receive any interest on the Expense Fund and
assign to the Seller Representative any such interest. Subject to Advisor
approval, the Seller Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Fund
from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Sellers. As soon as
reasonably determined by the Seller Representative that the Expense Fund is no
longer required to be withheld, the Seller Representative will distribute the
remaining Expense Fund (if any) to the Escrow Agent for further distribution
to the Sellers.

ESCROW AGREEMENT

  


 

  


 

  

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (as the same may be amended or modified from time to
time pursuant hereto, this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
[●], by and among Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Seller Representative_ "), EnerSys, a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ ",
and together with Seller Representative, sometimes referred to individually as
" _Party_ " or collectively as the " _Parties_ "), and Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). All capitalized terms used in this
Agreement but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth
in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Purchaser and Seller Representative are among the parties to that
certain Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 29, 2018, by and among
Purchaser, Alpha Innovations Limited, a Cyprus company, Alphatec Limited, a
Cyprus company, Radiant Energy Systems Limited, a Cyprus company (the "
_Sellers_ ") and Seller Representative (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Purchaser is purchasing the Shares from the Sellers in
accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement provides that Purchaser will deposit with the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof (i) the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to serve as security for the benefit of Purchaser against the
indemnifications by the Sellers afforded by _Article 8_ of the Purchase
Agreement and (ii) $7,500,000 in cash (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") to
serve as security for the benefit of Purchaser for payments to Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 1.3(g)-(h)_ of the Purchase Agreement.

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the Parties desire that the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
Adjustment Escrow Amount be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  


 

  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


 

  

1. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  

  

2. Escrow Assets.

  

  

(a) _Deposit_. Purchaser agrees to deposit with the Escrow Agent (i) [●]
shares of common stock of EnerSys, a Delaware corporation and the ultimate
owner of Purchaser (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") and the cash amount, if any, of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount, as determined in accordance with _Section
1.2(b)_ of the Purchase Agreement and (ii) the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(together with the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Assets_ ") on
the date hereof. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Shares as a book
position registered in the name of Computershare Trust Company, N.A. as Escrow
Agent for the benefit of Sellers. The Escrow Agent shall hold all other Escrow
Assets in a bank account and shall deposit such amount in one or more
interest-bearing accounts to be maintained by the Escrow Agent in the name of
the Escrow Agent at one or more of the banks, jointly approved by Purchaser
and Seller, listed in _Schedule 3_ to this Agreement, each of which shall be a
commercial bank with capital exceeding $500,000,000 (the " _Approved Banks_ "
and all amounts held in such account, including any Escrow Income (as defined
below) received in respect thereof, less any losses on investments thereof,
less distributions thereof, if any, the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The Parties agree
that the Adjustment Escrow Amount will be held in escrow and will be available
only to secure the obligations, if any, to pay Purchaser in accordance with
_Section 1.3(g)-(h)_ of the Purchase Agreement.

  

  

(b) _Ownership of the Escrow Assets_. The Escrow Agent does not own or have
any interest in the Escrow Assets but is serving as escrow holder, having only
possession thereof and agreeing to hold and distribute the Escrow Assets in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  

  

(c) _Rights with Respect to the Escrow Assets_.

  

  

i. With respect to the Escrow Shares, during the term of this Agreement, (A)
Seller Representative shall have the right to exercise any voting rights with
respect to any of the Escrow Shares; provided that Seller Representative shall
not have the right to exercise any voting rights with respect to any Reserved
Portion (as defined below) and (B) Sellers shall have the right to receive
dividends and distributions in respect of the Escrow Shares; provided that any
such dividends or distributions declared or made during the term of this
Agreement shall become part of the Escrow Assets pursuant to _Section
2(c)(ii)_ hereof. Seller Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent in
writing as to the exercise of any voting rights, and the Escrow Agent shall
comply, to the extent it is able to do so, with any such directions of Seller
Representative. In the absence of such directions, the Escrow Agent shall not
vote any of the shares of EnerSys common stock comprising the Escrow Shares.

  

  

     

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

ii. Any dividends or distributions paid with respect to the Escrow Shares and
any interest or other income otherwise earned on such dividends and
distributions and on the cash portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount or
the Adjustment Escrow Amount (collectively, " _Escrow Income_ ") shall be
deemed part of the Escrow Assets and be delivered and accrue to the Escrow
Fund, to be distributed in accordance with _Section 3_.

  

  

iii. The Escrow Agent offers the custody of funds placed, at the direction of
the Parties, in bank account deposits. The Escrow Agent will not provide any
investment advice in connection with this service. For purposes of this
Agreement, any such deposit of Escrow Income shall be deemed to be at the
direction of the Parties. At any time and from time to time, the Parties may
direct the Escrow Agent by written notice (A) to deposit any portion of the
Escrow Income with a specific Approved Bank, (B) not to deposit any new Escrow
Income in any Approved Bank specified in the notice and/or (C) to withdraw all
or any of the Escrow Income that may then be deposited with any Approved Bank
specified in the notice. With respect to any withdrawal notice, the Escrow
Agent will endeavor to withdraw such amount specified in the notice as soon as
reasonably practicable and the Parties acknowledge and agree that such
specified amount remains at the sole risk of the Parties prior to and after
such withdrawal. Such withdrawn amounts shall be deposited with any other
Approved Bank or any Approved Bank specified by the Parties in the notice.

  

  

iv. Escrow Agent shall pay interest on the Escrow Fund at a rate equal to 50%
of the then current 1 month U.S. Treasury Bill rate. Such interest shall
accrue to the Escrow Fund within three (3) Business Days (as defined in
_Section 10_ hereof) of each month end. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
retain for its own benefit, as partial compensation for its services
hereunder, any reduced banking charges and any amount of interest earned on
the Escrow Fund in excess of the amount payable to this _Section 2(c)(iv)_ or
otherwise herein provided.

  

  

v. The amounts held in custody by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement
are at the sole risk of the Parties and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for
any diminution of the Escrow Deposit which may result from any deposits made
pursuant to this Agreement, including any losses resulting from a default by
an Approved Bank or any other credit losses (whether or not resulting from
such default) or other losses on any deposit required to be liquidated in
order to make a payment required hereunder. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Escrow Agent is acting prudently and at their direction when
depositing the Escrow Deposit at any Approved Bank, and the Escrow Agent is
not required to make any further inquiries in respect of any Approved Bank.

  

  

vi. With respect to the Escrow Shares, in the event of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other
similar change in capitalization or event, or any distribution to holders of
the shares of EnerSys common stock, other than a regular cash dividend, the
Escrow Shares shall be appropriately adjusted on a pro rata basis.

  

  

3. Disposition and Termination.

  

  

(a) _Purchase Price Adjustment Claims_. Upon the Escrow Agent\'s receipt of
adequate documentation evidencing a final determination of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 1.3_ of the Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of its receipt of
that instruction, release, by wire transfer to an account or accounts
designated by the applicable Party, an amount from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount equal to the amount specified in such documentation. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the following forms of documentation will be considered
adequate: (A) a joint written instruction signed by Seller Representative and
Purchaser stating that there has been a final determination of the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 1.3_ of the Purchase Agreement and specifying the
amounts to be paid to the Sellers and/or Purchaser, as applicable, or (B) a
written notification from Purchaser or Seller Representative of a final and
non-appealable decision of the Independent Accounting Firm.

  

  

     

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

(b) _Indemnification-Related Claims_.

  

  

i. Subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in this _Section_
___3(b)_ , Purchaser shall be entitled to make indemnification claims against
the Indemnification Escrow Amount for any and all Losses incurred by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party for which the Purchaser Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification under _Article 8_ of the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to and
in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article 8_ of the Purchase
Agreement (subject always to the limitations and requirements set forth in the
Purchase Agreement and this Escrow Agreement).

  

  

ii. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if on or
before the date that is four years following the date of this Agreement (the "
_Escrow Termination Date_ ") the Escrow Agent and the Seller Representative
have received from Purchaser a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis for a claim for
indemnification pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the dollar amount of
the claim or, if such amount is unknown, Purchaser\'s good faith reasonable
estimate of the dollar amount of such claim (in each case also expressed as a
number of shares of EnerSys common stock calculated by dividing such dollar
amount by [●] (the " _Claimed Amount_ ")). Upon receipt of a Claim Notice, the
Escrow Agent shall continue to keep in escrow an amount of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount equal to the Claimed Amount set forth in such Claim Notice(s)
(the " _Reserved Portion_ ") until such Claimed Amount is resolved as provided
in the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
preceding sentence shall survive the Escrow Termination Date. At the time of
delivery of any Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent and the Seller
Representative, a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by
Purchaser to the Sellers in accordance with the terms of the Purchase
Agreement.

  

  

iii. Unless Seller Representative delivers to the Escrow Agent a notice
objecting in good faith to the creation of the Reserved Portion (or any amount
thereof) or the claim contained in the Claim Notice (the " _Contest Notice_ ")
within thirty (30) calendar days of Seller Representative receiving the
relevant Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 3(b)(i)_ hereof, the Escrow Agent
shall, without further instructions, promptly liquidate that portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount equal to the Claimed Amount as set forth in such
Claim Notice and deliver such amount to Purchaser after prior written notice
to Seller Representative. The Escrow Agent shall continue to hold in escrow
any contested Claimed Amount until release is otherwise authorized pursuant to
_Section 3(b)(iii)_ hereof. If any Contest Notice includes an objection to
only a portion of a Claimed Amount, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release to
Purchaser an amount from the Indemnification Escrow Amount equal to the
portion of the Claimed Amount in relation to which there is no objection after
prior written notice to Seller Representative.

  

  

iv. In the event that Seller Representative shall deliver a Contest Notice in
accordance with _Section 3(b)(ii)_ above, the Escrow Agent shall make
distributions with respect any Claimed Amount subject to such Contest Notice
only in accordance with: (i) any joint written instructions executed by both
Seller Representative and Purchaser; or (ii) a written notification from
Purchaser or Seller Representative of a final order from any court of
competent jurisdiction, which notification shall attach a copy of such final
order (a " _Final Order_ "). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any
such joint written instructions or Final Order and upon receipt thereof shall
promptly liquidate and distribute that portion of the remaining
Indemnification Escrow Amount as instructed in such joint written instructions
or Final Order.

  

  

v. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
payments made by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund shall first be made
from the cash portion of the Escrow Fund.

  

  

(c) _Release of Remaining Escrow Assets_. As soon as practicable (but no later
than three Business Days) after the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release to the Sellers the remaining portion of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount, if any, less any Reserved Portion. Any Reserved Portion shall
continue to be held in escrow under this Agreement by the Escrow Agent until
the claims contained in any Claim Notice(s) with respect thereto become
resolved pursuant to the terms hereof, even if such claims have not been
finally resolved prior to the Escrow Termination Date. In addition, upon the
later of the Escrow Termination Date or resolution of all continuing
indemnification claims, the Seller Representative shall deposit with the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to the remaining balance, if any, of the Expense
Fund (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for further distribution to the
Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Termination Date shall only
apply to the release of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and shall not
trigger any release of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (which will be released
pursuant to _Section_ ___3(a)_ hereof).

  

  

     

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

(d) _Joint Written Instruction_ _s_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if the Escrow Agent receives joint written instructions
from Seller Representative and Purchaser, or their respective successors or
permitted assigns, as to the disbursement of any Escrow Assets, the Escrow
Agent shall disburse such Escrow Assets pursuant to such joint written
instructions. The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to follow any
directions set forth in any joint written instructions unless and until the
Escrow Agent is satisfied, in its reasonable discretion, that the persons
executing said joint written instructions are authorized to do so.

  

  

(e) _Claims in Excess of the Escrow Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if any amount to be released at any time or under
any circumstances exceeds the then-current market value of the remaining
Escrow Assets, the Escrow Agent shall release the remaining Escrow Assets and
shall have no liability or responsibility to the Parties for any deficiency.

  

  

(f) _Termination_. Upon delivery of any and all remaining Escrow Assets by the
Escrow Agent, this Agreement shall terminate, subject to the provisions of
_Section 7_.

  

  

4. Escrow Agent.

  

  

a) _Duties_. The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically
and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties or obligations of any kind shall be implied nor
read into this Agreement against or on the part of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent accepts the duties and responsibilities under this Agreement as
agent only, and no trust is intended to be, or is or will be, created hereby
and the Escrow Agent shall owe no duties hereunder as trustee. The Escrow
Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor
have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith,
if any, including without limitation the Purchase Agreement, nor shall the
Escrow Agent be required to determine if any person or entity has complied
with any such agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow
Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference
thereto may be made in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, those of the Purchase Agreement,
any schedule or exhibit attached to this Agreement, or any other agreement
among the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control
only in connection with any matter related to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from
acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or request furnished to
it hereunder and reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper Party or Parties without inquiry and without
requiring substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable to any Party, any beneficiary or other person for refraining from
acting upon any instruction setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to,
or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Assets, or any
portion thereof, unless such instruction shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 10_ below and the Escrow Agent has
been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required
hereunder and as set forth in _Section 10_. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any
such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no
duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Assets nor
shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the
accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with it hereunder.

  

  

(b) _Liability_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any Damages (as
defined below) arising from or related to any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it except to the extent that such Damages are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of the Escrow
Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any
loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and
perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents.
The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel, accountants and other skilled
persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with, or in reasonable reliance upon, the advice or
opinion of any such legal counsel, accountants or other skilled persons. In
the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is some
ambiguity as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions,
claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with
any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from
taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property
held in escrow until it shall be given a direction in writing by the Parties
which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the
Escrow Agent or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute without making the Escrow Agent a party to the
same.

  

  

     

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  

5. Succession.

  

  

(a) _Resignation_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its
duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in
writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent
within the relevant jurisdiction or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties hereto. The
Escrow Agent\'s sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period
expires shall be to hold the Escrow Assets (without any obligation to reinvest
the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if
any, or in accordance with the directions of a Final Order or judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of delivery Escrow Agent\'s
obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the provisions of
_Section_ _7_ hereunder. In accordance with _Section 7_ below, the Escrow
Agent shall have the right to withhold an amount in cash equal to any amounts
due and owing to the Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow
Agent shall reasonably believe may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in
connection with the termination of the Agreement.

  

  

(b) _Removal_. The Escrow Agent may be removed (with or without cause) and a
new escrow agent may be appointed upon mutual agreement of Purchaser and
Seller Representative. In such event, Purchaser and Seller Representative
shall deliver joint written notice to the Escrow Agent of such removal
together with joint written instructions authorizing delivery of this
Agreement together with the Escrow Assets and any and all related instruments
or documents to a successor escrow agent.

  

  

(c) _Successors_. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or
substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow
Agent under this Agreement without further act.

  

  

6. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation for its services under this agreement as Escrow Agent and for reimbursement for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, in the amounts and payable as set forth on _Schedule 2_. All amounts owing under the foregoing sentence shall be paid fifty (50%) percent by Purchaser and fifty (50%) percent by Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). The Escrow Agent shall also be entitled to payment of any amounts to which the Escrow Agent is entitled under the indemnification provisions contained herein as set forth in _Section 7_. This _Section 6_ shall survive termination of this Agreement or the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent for any reason.

  

  

7. Indemnity.

  

  

(a) Subject to _Section 7(c)_ below, the Escrow Agent shall be liable for any
losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements,
actions, suits, proceedings, litigations, investigations, costs or expenses
(including without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees and expenses
of outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expenses of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively " _Damages_ ") only to the
extent such Damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
a result of the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that any liability of Escrow Agent will be limited to
direct damages sustained by a Party to this Agreement which in the aggregate
shall not exceed the value of the Escrow Asset held by the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(b) Purchaser and the Seller Representative (solely on behalf of the Sellers
and not in its individual capacity) shall jointly and severally indemnify and
hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against, and the Escrow Agent shall
not be responsible for, any and all Damages arising out of or attributable to
the Escrow Agent\'s duties under this Agreement or this appointment, including
the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any Damages or
enforcing this Agreement, except to the extent such Damages are determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of the Escrow Agent\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The indemnification provided for under this
_Section 7(b)_ shall be allocated and paid fifty (50%) percent by Purchaser
and fifty (50%) percent by Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers).

  

  

     

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

  

(c) Without limiting the Parties\' indemnification obligations set forth in
_Section 7(b)_ above, except in connection with third party claims, neither
the Parties nor the Escrow Agent shall be liable for any incidental, indirect,
special or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever, including, but not
limited to, loss of anticipated profits, occasioned by a breach of any
provision of this Agreement, even if apprised of the possibility of such
damages.

  

  

(d) This _Section 7_ shall survive termination of this Agreement or the
resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent for any reason.

  

  

8. Patriot Act Disclosure/Taxpayer Identification Numbers/Tax Reporting.

  

  

(a) _Patriot Act Disclosure_. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 (" _USA PATRIOT Act_ ") requires the Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that Section
326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agent\'s identity verification
procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to
confirm the Parties identity including without limitation name, address and
organizational documents (" _I_ _dentifying Information_ "). The Parties agree
to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining
from third parties any such Identifying Information required as a condition of
opening an account with or using any service provided by the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(b) _Certification and Tax Reporting_. The Parties, if applicable, have
provided the Escrow Agent with their respective fully executed Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-8, or W-9 and/or other required
documentation. All interest or other income earned under this Agreement shall
be allocated to Purchaser and reported, as and to the extent required by law,
by the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, on IRS Form
1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the Escrow
Assets by Purchaser whether or not said income has been distributed during
such year. Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the
absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law, and shall remit
such taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Parties hereby represent and
warrant to the Escrow Agent that (i) there is no sale or transfer of an United
States Real Property Interest as defined under IRC Section 897(c) in the
underlying transaction giving rise to this Agreement; and (ii) such underlying
transaction does not constitute an installment sale requiring any tax
reporting or withholding of imputed interest or original issue discount to the
IRS or other taxing authority.

  

  

9. Notices. All communications hereunder shall be in writing and except for communications from the Parties setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the full or partial transfer or distribution of the Escrow Assets, including but not limited to transfer instructions (all of which shall be specifically governed by _Section 10_ below), shall be deemed to be duly given after it has been received and the receiving party has had a reasonable time to act upon such communication if it is sent or served:

  

  

(a) delivered if delivered personally or by nationally recognized overnight
courier service (costs prepaid),

  


 

  

(b) sent by electronic mail with confirmation of transmission by the
transmitting equipment (or, the first Business Day following such transmission

certified or registered mail, return receipt requested to the appropriate

(a) In the event transfer instructions are so received by the Escrow Agent by
facsimile or other electronic transmission (including e-mail), the Escrow
Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone
call-back to the person or persons designated on _Schedule 1_ hereto, and the
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the
person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-
backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by
the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the
authorized representatives identified in _Schedule 1_ , the Escrow Agent is
hereby authorized both to receive written instructions from and seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of
Purchaser\'s executive officers, (" _Executive Officers_ "), as the case may
be, which shall include the titles of President, Chief Executive Officer,
Controller, General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer, as the Escrow Agent
may select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully
executed incumbency certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the

deliver the Escrow Assets to the custodian account or recipient designated by
Seller Representative in writing. Purchaser acknowledges that the Escrow Agent

In the event that any escrow property shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent reasonably obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  

  

12. Miscellaneous. Except for transfer instructions as provided in _Section 10_ , the provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and the Parties. Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by the Escrow Agent or any Party, except as provided in _Section 5_ , without the prior consent of the Escrow Agent and the Parties. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York. Each Party and the Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of any court of the State of New York or United States federal court, in each case, sitting in New York County, New York. The Parties and the Escrow Agent further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement. No Party to this Agreement is liable to any other Party for Damages due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of the Parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission (including e-mail), and such facsimile or other electronic transmission (including e-mail) will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such Party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have no right to enforce any term of this Agreement. The Parties represent, warrant and covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and regulations. Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such applicable law may be waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the Parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this Agreement shall be enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in _Section 7_ above, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or the Escrow Assets escrowed hereunder.

harmless, without duplication, Buyer, its Affiliates and each Person serving
as an officer, director, partner, stockholder or employee of Buyer and any of
its Affiliates (each individually a " _Buyer Indemnified Person_ " and

arising out of, relating to or resulting from any of the following:

   
---|---|---

    | 6.2 |  

 _Obligations of Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 6.5_
, from and after the Effective Time, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless,
without duplication, Seller, its Affiliates and each Person serving as an
officer, director, partner, stockholder or employee of Seller and any of its

any nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement; or

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) |  

any Assets or Assumed Liabilities, or any Taxes arising or resulting from or

    | 6.3 |  

 _Direct Claims_.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) |  

A party that seeks indemnity under this _Section 6_ (an " _Indemnified Person_
") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Person_ ") containing (i) a
description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Person, and (ii) a
reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the
facts then known by the Indemnified Person.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) |  

Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Person will
deliver to the Indemnified Person a written response to such Claim Notice. If
the Indemnifying Person fails to so respond within 30 days after delivery of
the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Person will be deemed to have
irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice and agreed to pay the Losses at issue in
the Claim Notice.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) |  

If, within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Person
delivers a written notice disputing the Indemnified Person\'s entitlement to
indemnification for the Losses described in the Claim Notice, then the
Indemnified Person will be entitled to submit such indemnification claim to
any court of competent jurisdiction, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

  

  

 

6   

 

  

  

  

    | 6.4 |  

 _Third-Party Claims_.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) |  

If any Indemnified Person receives notice of a claim or demand, whether or not
involving a Proceeding, by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or
an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against
such Indemnified Person with respect to which the Indemnifying Person is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Person will give the Indemnifying Person a Claim Notice within 30 days
following receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. Such Claim Notice
will describe the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and
the amount of the damages claimed by the other Person, in each case to the
extent known to the Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Person in so notifying the
Indemnifying Person will relieve the Indemnifying Person of any Liability or
obligation under this Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Person
suffers actual Losses directly caused by the delay or other deficiency

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) |  

Within 30 days after the Indemnified Person\'s delivery of a Claim Notice
under this _Section 6.4_ , the Indemnifying Person may assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim by giving to the Indemnified Person written
notice of the intention to assume such defense with counsel of its choice that
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person. An Indemnifying Person
will lose any previously acquired right to control the defense of any Third
Party Claim if for any reason the Indemnifying Person ceases to actively,
competently and diligently conduct the defense.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) |  

If the Indemnifying Person does not, or is not able to, assume or maintain
control of the defense of a Third Party Claim in compliance with this _Section
6.4_ , the Indemnified Person will have the right to control the defense of
the Third Party Claim. The party not controlling the defense (the "
_Noncontrolling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense. The
party controlling the defense (the " _Controlling Party_ ") will reasonably
advise the Noncontrolling Party of the status of the Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and, with respect to any Third Party Claim, the Controlling
Party will consider in good faith recommendations made by the Noncontrolling
Party. The Noncontrolling Party will furnish the Controlling Party with such
information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Claim and related
Proceedings (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading
which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and will
otherwise cooperate with and assist in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

  

 

7   

 

  

  

    | (d) |  

If the Indemnified Person is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Person has the right to agree in good faith to any compromise
or settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising from, the Third Party
Claim with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). All amounts paid or payable
under such settlement or Judgment are Losses that the Indemnifying Person owes
to the Indemnified Person under this _Section 6_. If the Indemnifying Person
is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person
will not enter into a settlement of, or the entry of any Judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person, except as set forth in this _Section 6.4(d)_. If a firm
offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or
the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Person and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional and complete
release of each Indemnified Person from any and all Liabilities in connection
with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person desires to accept and
agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Person will give written notice to that
effect to the Indemnified Person. If the Indemnified Person fails to timely
consent to such firm offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice,
the Indemnified Person may continue to contest or defend such Third Party
Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Person as
to such Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement offer.
If the Indemnified Person fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person may
settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to
settle such Third Party Claim.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (e) |  

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an Indemnifying Person assumes
any defense of any claim for which an Indemnified Person has sought
indemnification hereunder, the expenses incurred by such Indemnifying Person
in connection therewith, including legal costs and expenses, will not
constitute Losses for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount of
Losses Buyer Indemnified Person are entitled to be indemnified for pursuant to
this _Section 6._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (f) |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event of any Third Party Claim for Excluded Liabilities relating or
attributable to Taxes for which Seller is the Indemnifying Person and Buyer is
the Indemnified Person, the procedures and limitations set forth in _Section
7.7(a)_ , _Section 7.7(b)_ _Section 7.7(c)_ of the Purchase Agreement will
apply to all such Third Party Claims for Excluded Liabilities related or
attributable to Taxes, as if such provisions were fully set forth herein,
substituting (i) "Buyer" for "Purchaser", and (ii) "Seller" for "Seller
Representative", and whereby "Tax Contest" will mean any Tax audit,
assessment, adjustment, examination, or other proceeding with, by or against
any Governmental Authority or with respect to Excluded Liabilities related or
attributable to Taxes, in each case, for which the Seller may reasonably be
expected to be liable or obligated to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement to the contrary, Seller will be permitted
to elect and assume control of the defense of any Tax Contest relating to any
Tax period of Seller ending on or before the closing date of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 6.5 |  

 _Limitations; Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) |  

The aggregate total amount in respect of which Seller will be liable to
indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement will not exceed aggregate value of the Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities sold and transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that the aggregate total amount in respect of which Seller
and each other seller that is party to a Restructuring Agreement (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement) will be liable to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Person as a result of any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.3_ (or any corresponding representation and
warranty in any other Restructuring Agreement) will not exceed the then-
remaining amount held in the Indemnity Escrow Account (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement), if any.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

  

 

8   

 

  

  

    | (b) |  

No Buyer Indemnified Persons will be entitled to indemnification or
reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the
extent such Person or its Affiliates has received payment or have been
actually reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement. To the extent arising from any breach of
any representations, warranties or covenants hereunder, Losses with respect to
any Person as of any date will be determined net of the amount of any
insurance proceeds actually received by such Person with respect thereto
(whether received prior to or subsequent to a claim made by such Person).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (c) |  

Except in the case of (i) fraud or criminal act(s) on behalf of Seller or (ii)
the indemnification provided under _Article 8_ of the Purchase Agreement, from
and after the Effective Time, the exclusive remedy for any Indemnified Person
for any matter arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is the indemnification provided under this _Section 6_. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 6_ will modify, impair or otherwise limit the
rights and remedies of any Indemnified Person under the Purchase Agreement
(including any right to indemnification under _Article 8_ thereof).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (d) |  

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO
EVENT WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _SECTION 6_
FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOST OPPORTUNITY OR LOST SALES)
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT OF THE
CONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE
NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT, IN
EACH CASE EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAYABLE BY AN INDEMNIFIED
PERSON TO A THIRD PARTY IN RESPECT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 6.6 | _Tax Treatment._ Unless otherwise required by any applicable
Law, all indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement will
constitute for all Tax purposes an adjustment to the purchase price, and no
Party will take any position inconsistent with such characterization.

    _Section 7._  |  

 _Miscellaneous_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.1 |  

[ _Consents_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, neither this Agreement nor any documents or agreement delivered
pursuant to this Agreements effects an assignment of any [Contract or] [any
other] Asset if applicable local Law would nevertheless deem this Agreement to
be an assignment, and such constructive assignment thereof, without the
consent of a third Person, would constitute a breach or other contravention
thereof or would be ineffective with respect to any party thereto, and with
respect to any such [Contract or other] Asset, the Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time the consent of the applicable third Person or, alternatively,
written confirmation from such third Person reasonably satisfactory to the
Parties that such consent is not required. In no event, however, will Seller
or any of its Affiliates be obligated to pay any money to any Person or to
offer or grant other financial or other accommodations to any Person in
connection with obtaining any consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or
approval with respect to any such [Contract or other] Asset. The failure by
Buyer or Seller to obtain any required consent, waiver, confirmation, novation
or approval with respect to any such [Contract or other] Asset will not, in
and of itself, relieve any Party from its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby at the Effective Time. If and when such
consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or approval is obtained, Seller will
promptly transfer and assign such [Contract or other] Asset to Buyer in
accordance with this Agreement. Until such Asset can be transferred and
assigned to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ , each Party will use
commercially reasonable best efforts to enter into such arrangements to
provide to Buyer the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable
Law, operational equivalent of the transfer and assignment of such [Contract
or other] Asset to Buyer as of the Effective Time, and the performance by
Buyer of its obligations with respect thereto. Buyer will, as agent or
subcontractor for Seller pay, perform and discharge fully the Liabilities and
obligations of Seller thereunder from and after the Effective Time. To the
extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller will hold in trust for and pay
to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies
received by Seller to the extent related to such [Contract or other] Asset in
connection with the arrangements under this _Section 7.1_.]

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.2 |  

 _Tax and Related Matters_.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (a) |  

Seller will pay all Transfer Taxes that are required to be paid in connection
with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the Restructuring, regardless of the Party upon which such
amounts would have been imposed absent this provision. The Parties will
cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably requested and legally
permitted to minimize any such Taxes including obtaining and supplying any
exemption certificates or other documents necessary to reduce or eliminate
such Taxes. The Party required by Law to file such Tax Returns will prepare
and file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes, costs and fees within the time period prescribed by Law; provided,
however, Buyer will not file any such Tax Return that is required to be filed
by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_ without the prior written consent
of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | (b) |  

All Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis on or with respect to the
Assets or the Business (such as real property Taxes or other ad valorem Taxes)
for Tax periods beginning on or before, and ending after, the closing date of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be prorated between
Seller and Buyer in accordance with the principles of _Section 7.1(b)_ of the
Purchase Agreement). Seller will be responsible for such periodic Taxes
relating to the portion of such Taxable period beginning on the first day of
such Tax period and ending on and including the closing date of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer will be responsible for
the periodic Taxes relating to the portion of such Taxable period beginning
the day after the closing date of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and ending on the last day of such Taxable period.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

  

 

10   

 

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

After the Closing, Seller will (i) file all Tax Returns required to be filed
by it; and (ii) pay all Taxes due and payable by it, including all Taxes
resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise in connection
with the Restructuring; and (iii) retain or set aside an amount of the
purchase price payable to it pursuant to this Agreement to satisfy all of its
Liabilities (including, but not limited to, Liabilities resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Restructuring and the Taxes due), and
not dissolve (whether by liquidation, merger, conversion, or otherwise) prior
to the later of (i) the 5th anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the date
on which all of its respective Liabilities have been paid or appropriate
amounts have been set aside for the payment thereof.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.3 |  

 _Further Assurances_. The Parties hereto each agree to perform such acts,
execute and deliver such instruments and documents, and do all such other
things as may be reasonably necessary to accomplish the transactions
contemplated in and to otherwise give effect to this Agreement. If the Parties
discover after the Effective Time that any Asset to be transferred or Assumed
Liability to be assumed under this Agreement did not properly transfer on the
Effective Time, Seller and Buyer will cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to take any actions necessary to effect such transfer(s) or
assumption as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.4 |  

 _Refunds and Remittances_. If Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, after the Effective Time receives any funds properly belonging to the
other Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the receiving
Party will promptly so advise such other Party, will segregate and hold such
funds in trust for the benefit of such other Party and will promptly deliver
such funds, together with any interest earned thereon, to an account or
accounts designated in writing by such other Party.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.5 |  

 _Governing Law_. The laws of the State of Delaware (excluding its rules
governing conflicts of laws that may require an application of a different
law) will govern the construction, interpretation and other matters arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement (whether arising in contract,
tort, equity or otherwise).

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.6 |  

 _Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. In any action or Proceeding between
any of the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Parties knowingly,
voluntarily and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of New
Castle County, Delaware, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the
U.S. federal courts in the District of Delaware, and waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of forum. Any party to
this Agreement may make service on another party by sending or delivering a
copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 7._ _10_.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

  

 

11   

 

  

  

    | 7.7 |  

 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.8 |  

 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way and the
parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid, illegal and
unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that
achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.9 |  

 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto,
constitutes the final agreement by and between the Parties, and is the
complete and exclusive statement of the Parties\' agreement on the matters
contained herein. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements
between the Parties with respect to the matters contained herein are
superseded by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties
contemplate that they may desire to enter into or execute transfer instruments
of various kinds consistent with, but in some cases duplicative of, this
Agreement in order to effect the transfer of the Assets and/or to facilitate
the registration of such transfer with local governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over the Assets.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

    | 7.10 |  

 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must be

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

  

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as
of [●], 2018, by and among Alpha Technology Services, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (" _ATS_ ") on the one hand, and Alpha Technologies, Inc., a
British Columbia company and Altair Advanced Industries, Inc., a Washington
corporation (collectively, the " _Asset Sellers_ "), on the other hand.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Purchase Agreement (defined below).

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of
October 29, 2018 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among the Purchaser,
Sellers and the Seller Representative, ATS and each Asset Seller will enter
into Restructuring Agreements pursuant to which, among other things, certain
assets and related liabilities of the Asset Sellers will be assigned and
transferred to ATS.

  

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement and the Restructuring Agreements, the Asset Sellers and ATS have
agreed that, following the Closing, ATS will provide, or cause to be provided
to, the Asset Sellers certain transition services on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound and in consideration of the
mutual provisions set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

  

 _Section 1._ _Transition Services_. During the term of this Agreement, ATS
shall provide, or cause to be provided to, the Asset Sellers, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, such administrative services more
particularly described on _Schedule A_ (the " _Transition Services_ ").

  

 _Section 2_. _Nature of the Transition Services_.

  

(a) _Level of Service_. ATS shall perform the Transition Services in the
manner and at a relative level of service and degree of care, quality and
efficiency substantially similar to that provided by ATS with respect to the
Asset Sellers during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date.

  

(b) _Use of Services_. The Transition Services shall be provided to the Asset
Sellers for use exclusively in connection with the conduct of their respective
businesses and only for substantially the same purpose and in substantially
the same manner as the Asset Sellers used such services immediately prior to
the Closing Date. The Asset Sellers shall not, and shall not permit their
Affiliates or any of its or their employees or agents, to resell any
Transition Services to any third party.

  

(c) _Level of Use_. The parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the
Transition Services. Accordingly, the Asset Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to end its reliance on the receipt of Transition Services
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing, and each party
shall take all necessary measures that can reasonably be expected of that
party for purposes of ceasing the provision or the receipt of Transition
Services.

  

     

 

  

  

(d) _Modification of Transition Services_. ATS may make changes from time to
time in the manner of performing Transition Services so long as (i) ATS
provides the Asset Sellers with advance written notice of such changes and
(ii) such changes do not have a materially adverse impact on the nature,
quality, availability or timeliness of the applicable Transition Service.

  

(e) _Additional Services; Extension of Services_. The Asset Sellers may
request, by written notice to ATS, that ATS provide (i) additional Transition
Services that are not specifically identified in _Schedule A_ or (ii) an
extension of existing Transition Services, in either case, in connection with
the orderly transition of their respective businesses. If ATS elects, in its
sole and absolute discretion, to provide additional Transition Services or an
extension of Transition Services pursuant to such a request, _Schedule A_
shall be amended to reflect such addition or extension and such rate of
compensation therefor as the parties may mutually agree.

  

(f) _Cooperation and Access_. Each party will cooperate and cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate with each other in respect of the provision
of the Transition Services, including by using commercially reasonable efforts
to refrain from taking actions that would prohibit or materially limit the
performance of such party\'s obligations or would increase the cost of
provision of any Transition Service. Without limiting the foregoing, the Asset
Sellers shall make available on a timely basis to ATS and its Affiliates
information, personnel, facilities and materials reasonably requested to
enable provision of the Transition Services by or on behalf of ATS. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party will designate a project manager who
shall serve as the other party\'s main contact person to coordinate the
parties\' respective obligations under this Agreement. The parties will each
be entitled to rely on instructions or information provided by the designated
project manager, and shall not be in breach of this Agreement as a result of
such reliance.

  

(g) _Compliance with Law_. During the term of this Agreement and in connection
with the provision of the Transition Services, ATS, the Asset Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall comply in all material respects and shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause others to comply in all material
respects, with applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties shall, upon the request of a party, cooperate in good
faith to promptly execute, and cause any Affiliate or third party to which it
discloses data relating to an identified or identifiable natural Person,
whether on a standalone basis or when aggregated with other data (" _Personal
Data_ ") or allows access to Personal Data, to execute supplemental data
processing agreement(s) if a party reasonably concludes that such steps are
necessary to address applicable data protection or privacy Laws concerning the
processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. The parties shall agree on
the supplemental data processing agreement(s) in good faith, taking into
account the nature of the Transition Services provided and the obligation to
carry out this contractual relationship in compliance with applicable data
protection or privacy Laws.

  

 _Section 3_. _Cessation of Usage of Transition Services_. The Asset Sellers
shall have no obligation to continue to use any of the Transition Services and
may terminate any Transition Service, in whole or in part, by giving ATS not
less than ten (10) days\' prior written notice of its desire to terminate any
particular Transition Service, in whole or in part (the " _Termination Notice_
"). As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of the Termination
Notice, ATS shall advise the Asset Sellers whether the termination of such
Transition Service shall require the termination or partial termination of any
other Transition Services that are related to or dependent upon the Transition
Service the Asset Sellers seek to terminate. Subject to _Section 4(b)_ , upon
such termination, the Asset Sellers\' obligation to pay any future fees
applicable to such Transition Service, and ATS\'s obligation to provide such
Transition Service hereunder, shall terminate.

  

     

 

  

  

 _Section 4._ _Term and Termination_.

  

(a) _Term_. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and
continue until the date upon which ATS shall have no continuing obligation to
perform any Transition Services as a result of each of their expiration. The
date on which the term of this Agreement terminates in accordance with the
preceding sentence is referred to herein as the " _Termination Date_."

  

(b) _Effect of Termination_. On the Termination Date, all rights and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall immediately cease and
terminate, and no party shall have any further obligation to the other party
with respect to this Agreement, except with respect to (i) fees and charges
then incurred under this Agreement but unpaid and (ii) the rights and
obligations pursuant to this _Section 4(b),_ and _Section 5(d)-(f)_ , _Section
7_ , _Section 8_ , _Section 9_ and _Section 10_ , which shall survive such
termination in accordance with their respective terms.

  

 _Section 5_. _Fees_.

  

(a) _Compensation for Transition Services_.

  

(i) The Transition Services shall be free of charge for the first ninety (90)
days. After the expiration of such ninety (90) day period, if the Asset
Sellers determine that they need continued Transition Services, the price for
such services will be separately negotiated and agreed to in good faith.

  

(ii) During the term of this Agreement, the Asset Sellers shall reimburse ATS
for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses (the " _Out-of-Pocket
Expenses_ ") incurred by it and/or its Affiliates in connection with the
performance of the Transition Services.

  

(iii) Other than the fees to be paid for the Transition Services as set out in
_Schedule A_, the parties shall bear their own expenses in connection with the
Transition Services.

  

(b) _Time of Payment_. On a monthly basis, to the extent that the Asset
Sellers have incurred charges for the Transition Services in such month, ATS
shall provide an invoice of work performed (each, an " _Invoice_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail the amounts owed by the Asset Sellers for the
Transition Services based upon the fees set forth in _Schedule A_ and any Out-
of-Pocket Expenses. The Asset Sellers shall pay in full the aggregate amount
set forth on each Invoice within thirty (30) days after delivery thereof. All
payments hereunder shall be paid, in U.S. dollars, in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by ATS.

  

     

 

  

  

(c) _Invoice Disputes_. In the event of any dispute with respect to an Invoice
(or any portion thereof), the Asset Sellers shall deliver a written statement
to ATS no later than ten (10) days prior to the date payment is due on the
disputed Invoice listing all disputed items and providing a reasonably
detailed description of each disputed item. Amounts not so disputed shall be
deemed accepted and shall be final and binding on the parties; provided,
however, that nothing in this _Section 5(c)_ shall prevent the Asset Sellers
from disputing any Invoice that includes an incorrectly calculated fee or
charge for a period of sixty (60) days following the date the Invoice was paid
by the Asset Sellers.

  

(d) _Sales Taxes_. All consideration under this Agreement is exclusive of any
sales, transfer, value-added, goods or services tax or similar gross receipts
based tax (excluding all other taxes including taxes based upon or calculated
by reference to income, receipts or capital) imposed against or on any of the
Transition Services (" _Sales Taxes_ ") provided hereunder, and such Sales
Taxes will be added to the applicable Invoice where applicable. The Asset
Sellers shall be responsible for any such Sales Taxes and shall either (i)
remit such Sales Taxes to ATS (which shall remit such amounts to the
applicable taxing authority) or (ii) provide ATS with a certificate or other
acceptable proof evidencing an exemption from liability for such Sales Taxes.

  

(e) _Other Taxes_. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
the Asset Sellers under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or
withholding for any taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any
applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any tax from any such
payment by ATS, then ATS (i) shall be entitled to make such deduction or
withholding, and (ii) shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld in
accordance with applicable Law.

  

(f) _No Right of Setoff_. The parties acknowledge that they shall have no
right under this Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to become due and
owing) to it by any other party, whether under this Agreement, the Purchase
Agreement, the other Ancillary Documents or otherwise, against any amount owed
(or to become due and owing) by it to any other party.

  

 _Section 6_. _Personnel_.

  

(a) _Right to Designate and Change Personnel_. ATS shall have the right, in
its sole discretion, to designate which personnel shall be assigned to perform
the Transition Services, including the right to remove and replace any such
personnel at any time or to designate an Affiliate to perform any or all of
the Transition Services.

  

(b) _Responsibility for Wages and Fees_. For such time as any employees of ATS
or any of its Affiliates are providing the Transition Services, (i) such
employees will remain employees of ATS or its applicable Affiliates, and shall
not be deemed to be employees of the Asset Sellers for any purpose, and all
such employees shall be within the exclusive direction, control and
supervision of ATS and its Affiliates, and (ii) ATS or its applicable
Affiliate shall be solely responsible for the payment and provision of all
wages, bonuses, commissions and employee benefits (including severance and
worker\'s compensation) and for the withholding and payment of applicable
taxes relating to such employment.

  

     

 

  

  

 _Section 7_. _Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) _ATS IP and Assets_. Any software, development tools, know-how,
methodologies, processes, technologies, algorithms or other Intellectual
Property, and any tangible or other intangible assets, owned by ATS or any of
its Affiliates and which may during the term of this Agreement be operated or
used in connection with the provision or receipt of the Transition Services
shall remain ATS\'s or any such Affiliate\'s property, and neither the Asset
Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any rights or
interests therein, except as provided in the immediately following sentence.
the ownership of any assets created, obtained, acquired, discovered,
developed, conceived or otherwise obtained or coming into existence during or
as a result of the performance of any Transition Services pursuant to this
Agreement shall remain the property of ATS; _provided_ , that any such assets
that relate solely to the business of the Asset Sellers and which are created,
obtained, acquired, discovered, developed, conceived or otherwise obtained
solely by the Asset Sellers or its Affiliates without any participation,
involvement or assistance from ATS or any of its Affiliates shall be the sole
and exclusive property of the Asset Sellers or their Affiliates, as
applicable.

  

(b) _Confidentiality_.

  

(i) In consideration of each disclosure of Confidential Information by the
parties, each party shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives (its " _Restricted Persons_ ") to, maintain the
confidentiality of, and not use Confidential Information for their own benefit
or the benefit of any other Person.

  

(ii) Neither ATS nor the Asset Sellers will, and ATS and the Asset Sellers
will cause each of their respective Restricted Persons not to, disclose to any
Person any information with respect to the legal, financial or other terms or
conditions of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The foregoing does not restrict the right of any party to disclose such
information (i) to its respective Restricted Persons to the extent reasonably
required in the performance of this Agreement or as required for internal
business purposes, (ii) to any Governmental Authority to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any Proceeding relating to the enforcement of this
Agreement, and (iii) as required by the rules of any stock exchange or any
applicable Law. Each party will advise its respective Restricted Persons with
respect to the confidentiality obligations under this _Section 7(b)_ and will
be responsible for any breach or violation of such obligations by its
Restricted Persons.

  

(iii) If a party or any of its respective Restricted Persons become legally
compelled, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, to make any disclosure
that is prohibited or otherwise restricted by this Agreement, then such party
will (i) take all reasonable steps to preserve the privileged nature and
confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including requesting that the
Confidential Information not be disclosed to non-parties or the public, (ii)
promptly notify the disclosing party in writing so that the disclosing party
may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective order or
other remedy, and (iii) consult with and assist the disclosing party, at the
disclosing party\'s sole cost and expense, in obtaining an injunction or other
appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, such party (or such other
persons to whom such request is directed) will furnish only that portion of
the Confidential Information which, on the advice of its legal counsel, is
legally required to be disclosed and, upon the disclosing party\'s request,
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such information.

  

     

 

  

  

 _Section 8._ _Limitation of Liability; Indemnification_.

  

(a) _LIMITATION ON WARRANTY_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE ASSET
SELLERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (I) ATS AND ITS AFFILIATES ARE NOT
IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING TRANSITION SERVICES, ATS AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE
AGREED TO PROVIDE THE TRANSITION SERVICES HEREUNDER SOLELY AS AN ACCOMMODATION
TO THE ASSET SELLERS AND SUCH TRANSITION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS,
WHERE-IS" BASIS AND IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER ATS NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
MAKES, NOR ARE THE ASSET SELLERS RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY WITH
RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS OR THE RESULTS
TO BE OBTAINED FROM SUCH TRANSITION SERVICES, AND THE ASSET SELLERS AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES HEREBY DISCLAIM THE SAME.

  

(b) _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_.

  

(i) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN
NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _SECTION
8_ FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOST OPPORTUNITY OR LOST
SALES) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT
OF THE CONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
THE NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT,
IN EACH CASE EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAYABLE BY AN INDEMNIFIED
PERSON TO A THIRD PARTY IN RESPECT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, other than in
the event of fraud or intentional misconduct, ATS\'s maximum liability to the
Asset Sellers and their respective Affiliates arising under or in relation to
this Agreement or any of the Transition Services shall be limited to an amount
equal to the amount paid by the Asset Sellers under this Agreement.

  

(c) _Indemnity_. ATS shall indemnify and hold harmless the Asset Sellers and
their Affiliates (the " _Asset Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
any and all Losses incurred by the Asset Seller Indemnified Parties arising or
resulting from gross negligence or intentional misconduct of ATS or any
delegate of ATS with regard to the provision of, failure to provide, or manner
of providing any Transition Services. The Asset Sellers shall indemnify and
hold harmless ATS and its Affiliates (the " _ATS Indemnified Parties_ ") from
and against any and all Losses incurred by the ATS Indemnified Parties arising
or resulting from the Asset Seller\'s assistance with, participation in and
performance of this Agreement, including with respect to any third-party
claims and Losses related thereto, other than Losses caused by gross
negligence or intentional misconduct of ATS or any delegate of ATS. The
procedures contained in the indemnification provisions set forth in _Article
8_ of the Purchase Agreement shall apply with respect to each party\'s
indemnification obligations under this _Section 8(c)_. The right to
indemnification and the remedies set forth in this _Section 8(c)_ shall
constitute the parties\' sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any and
all claims arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Transition
Services provided hereunder.

  

     

 

  

  

 _Section 9._ _Dispute Resolution_.

  

(a) _Dispute Notice; Dispute Meeting_. In the event of a dispute arising out
of or in relation to this Agreement (a " _Dispute_ "), any party to the
Dispute may deliver a written dispute notice to the other party to the
Dispute. The written disputes notice will refer to this clause and must
contain reasonable details of the Dispute as well as the Losses, if any,
suffered by the party giving the written dispute notice. The parties to a
Dispute must, no later than ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the
written dispute notice, hold a meeting (the " _Dispute Meeting_ ") at which
they must use all reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute in an amicable
manner. In the Dispute, [●] will represent any and all Asset Sellers and [●]
will represent ATS, with each having sufficient authority to conduct
negotiations on behalf of the Asset Sellers and ATS, respectively, and, if
relevant, to settle the Dispute.

  

 


 

  

(b) _Arbitration_

 

  

(i) Any Dispute which is not amicably resolved within twenty (20) Business
Days after delivery of the written dispute notice will (regardless of whether
or not a Dispute Meeting has actually been held) at the request of any party
to the Dispute, be referred to non-binding arbitration in accordance with the
Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.
The place of arbitration will be Delaware. The language of the arbitration
Proceedings will be English. The Asset Sellers will appoint one arbitrator and
ATS will appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed will
agree on a third arbitrator, who will be the chairman of the arbitration
tribunal. If a party fails to appoint an arbitrator or the two arbitrators
appointed by the parties cannot agree on a third arbitrator, in each case
within thirty (30) calendar days, then the relevant arbitrator will be
appointed subject to the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in
effect.

  

(ii) On or before the forty-fifth (45th) day following (and including) the
date on which third arbitrator was finally selected, the arbitrators will
render a written judgment with respect to each matter involved in the Dispute.
Any award of the arbitrators will be non-binding on the parties. The
arbitrators will decide all issues in dispute pursuant to applicable Law as
specified in _Section 10(i)_.

  

(iii) Nothing in this _Section 9_ limits the right of a party to bring
Proceedings against another party in any court of competent jurisdiction upon
the conclusion of the arbitration procedures set forth in this _Section 9_.

  

(iv) Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to claim any
immunity from Proceedings brought by another party against it under this
_Section 9_ __ and to ensure that no such claim is made on its behalf). Each
party hereby consents generally to the giving of any relief or the issue of
any process in connection with those Proceedings, and waives all rights of
immunity in respect of it or its assets.

  

     

 

  

  

 _Section 10._ _General Provisions_.

  

(a) _Amendment_. This Agreement can only be amended, modified or supplemented
at any time by the parties to this Agreement, through an instrument
identifying itself as an amendment to this Agreement and signed by each party
hereto.

  

(b) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto)
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, or any
of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

  

(c) _Force Majeure_. In the event that ATS is delayed in or prevented from
performing its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, due to
any cause, act or event beyond such ATS\'s reasonable control, including acts
of God strikes, embargoes, terroristic attacks, delays in the mail,
transportation and delivery, power failures and shortages, fires, floods,
epidemics and unusually severe weather conditions (a " _Force Majeure Event_
"), then upon written notice to the Asset Sellers, (i) the affected
obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended to the extent reasonably
necessary during the period of the Force Majeure Event, (ii) ATS shall have
the right to apportion its services in an equitable manner to all users, (iii)
ATS shall not have any liability to the Asset Sellers or any other Person in
connection with such suspended obligation and (iv) ATS shall resume
performance as soon as practicable after the Force Majeure Event has ended.
The Asset Sellers may immediately cancel the underlying Transition Service if
the Force Majeure Event lasts longer than sixty (60) days; provided that, upon
such cancellation by the Asset Sellers, ATS is entitled to receive payment of
any and all fees incurred in the performance of the Transition Services prior
to the date of such cancellation.

  

(d) _Interpretation; Headings_. In the negotiation of this Agreement, each
party has received advice from its own attorney. The language used in this
Agreement is the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against
any party because that party or its attorney drafted the provision. The
descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not constitute a part of this Agreement.

  

(e) _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way
and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid,
illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable
provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision.

  

     

 

  

  

(f) _Assignment and Successors and No Third Person Rights_. This Agreement
binds and benefits the parties and their respective successors and assigns. No
party may assign any rights under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other party, except for assignments to Affiliates for which no
consent is required. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any third
Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement except such rights as may inure to a successor or
permitted assignee under this _Section 10(f)_ or the rights to indemnification
that may inure to the parties specified in _Section 8(c)_.

  

(g) _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other parties. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email

(i) _Governing Law_. The internal laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates,
including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance and
enforcement and any disputes or controversies arising therefrom or related
thereto.

  

(j) _Jurisdiction and Service of Process._ In any action or Proceeding between
any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent not subject to
_Section 9_ ), the parties knowingly, voluntarily and irrevocably submits to
the jurisdiction of the courts of New Castle County, Delaware, or, if it has
or can acquire jurisdiction, in the U.S. federal courts in the District of
Delaware, and waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to
convenience of forum. Any party to this Agreement may make service on another
party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served
at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
_Section 10(h)_.

  

(k) _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

  

(l) _Waiver and Remedies._ The parties may (i) extend the time for performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party to this Agreement,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
party to this Agreement contained in this Agreement or in any certificate,
instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) waive
compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit
of such party contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver by any
party to this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in a written document
signed on behalf of the party or parties against whom the waiver or extension
is to be effective. No extension or waiver will apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any covenant, agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that
which is specified in the written extension or waiver. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing
between the parties, operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or
further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or
remedy. Except as otherwise expressly set out in this Agreement, any
enumeration of a party\'s rights and remedies in this Agreement is not
intended to be exclusive, and a party\'s rights and remedies are intended to
be cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any rights and
remedies authorized in law or in equity.

  

     

 

  

  

(m) _Relationship of the Parties._ Each party acknowledges and agrees that

venture or relationships of trust or agency between the parties and that all
Transition Services are provided by ATS as an independent contractor. In
matters relating to this Agreement, each party shall be solely responsible for
the acts of its employees and agents, and such employees or agents shall not
be considered employees or agents of the other party. Neither party shall have
any right, power or authority to create any obligation, express or implied, on
behalf of the other except to the extent expressly provided herein. Each party
agrees not to hold itself out as having any authority or relationship contrary
to this _Section 10(m)_.
