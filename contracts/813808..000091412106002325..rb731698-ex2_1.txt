                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 26, 2006 (this
"Agreement"), by and between Republic Bancorp Inc., a Michigan corporation
("Republic"), and Citizens Banking Corporation, a Michigan corporation
("Citizens").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

            WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Republic and Citizens have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement in which Republic will, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Citizens (the
"Merger"), so that Citizens is the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation"); and

            WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this
Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

            WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree
as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

            1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the
"MBCA"), at the Effective Time, Republic shall merge with and into Citizens.
Citizens shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Michigan. As of the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Republic shall cease.

            1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Michigan on the Closing Date. The
term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

            1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 724 of the MBCA.

            1.4 Conversion of Republic Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Citizens, Republic or
the holder of any of the following securities:

                  (a) Each share of common stock, without par value, of Citizens
      (including the related preferred stock purchase rights, the "Citizens
      Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
      Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the
      Merger.

                  (b) All shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of
      Republic issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
      (the "Republic Common Stock") that are owned by Republic or Citizens
      (other than shares of Republic Common Stock held in trust accounts,
      managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
      capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares,
      "Trust Account Common Shares") and other than shares of Republic Common
      Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Republic or Citizens in respect of
      a debt previously contracted (any such shares, "DPC Common Shares")) shall
      be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Citizens or other
      consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (c) Subject to Section 1.4(f), all shares of Republic Common
      Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Citizens
      or Republic, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
      be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. For the
      avoidance of doubt, the Stock Consideration paid pursuant to this Section
      1.4(c) shall not be subject to, and will not be deemed to be Stock
      Election Shares or otherwise taken into account in calculating,
      adjustments under Section 1.5(b).

                  (d) Subject to Sections 1.4(f) and 1.5, each share of Republic
      Common Stock, except for shares of Republic Common Stock owned by Republic
      or Citizens (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares)
      or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries, shall be converted,
      at the election of the holder thereof, in accordance with the procedures
      set forth in Section 2.1, into the right to receive the following, without
      interest:

                        (i) for each share of Republic Common Stock with respect
            to which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and
            not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Article II (a "Cash
            Election"), the right to receive in cash from Citizens an amount
            (the "Cash Consideration") equal to the Per Share Amount
            (collectively, the "Cash Election Shares");

                        (ii) for each share of Republic Common Stock with
            respect to which an election to receive Citizens Common Stock has
            been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to
            Article II (a "Stock Election"), the right to receive from Citizens
            the fraction of a share of Citizens Common Stock (the "Stock
            Consideration") as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (collectively, the
            "Stock Election Shares"); and

                        (iii) for each share of Republic Common Stock other than
            shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been
            effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to
            Article II (collectively, the "Non-Election Shares"), the right to
            receive from Citizens such Stock Consideration and/or Cash
            Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 1.5(b).

                  "Exchange Ratio" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the
      nearest one ten thousandth, of (A) the Per Share Amount divided by (B) the
      Citizens Closing Price.

                  "Per Share Amount" shall mean the sum, rounded to the nearest
      cent, of (A) $2.08 plus (B) the product, rounded to the nearest cent, of
      0.4378 (the "Share Ratio") times the Citizens Closing Price.

                  "Citizens Closing Price" shall mean the average, rounded to
      the nearest cent, of the closing sale prices of Citizens Common Stock on
      The Nasdaq Stock Market (the "Nasdaq") as reported by The Wall Street
      Journal for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the
      Effective Time.

                  "Cash Component" shall mean $154,850,330.

                  The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are
      sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration."

                  (e) All of the shares of Republic Common Stock converted into
      the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I
      shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
      shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate
      previously representing any such shares of Republic Common Stock (each, a
      "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
      Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which
      the shares of Republic Common Stock represented by such Certificate have
      been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as
      any dividends to which holders of Republic Common Stock become entitled in
      accordance with Section 2.3(c).

                  (f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
      Time, the outstanding shares of Citizens Common Stock shall have been
      increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
      kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
      recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
      stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and
      proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Share Ratio.

                  (g) The parties acknowledge that pursuant to Section 762 of
      the MBCA no shareholders of Republic shall be entitled to exercise
      appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

            1.5 Proration. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in
this Agreement, the total number of shares of Republic Common Stock to be
converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (the "Cash Conversion
Number") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Cash
Component by (y) the Per Share Amount. All other shares of Republic Common Stock
shall be converted into Stock Consideration (other than shares of Republic
Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 1.4(b)).

            (b) Within two Business Days after the Effective Time, Citizens
shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined below) to effect the allocation among
holders of Republic Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration as follows:

                  (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Republic Common Stock
      with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (the "Cash
      Election Number") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock
      Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
      right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each
      holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
      Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to
      the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares
      held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash
      Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number
      (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a),
      whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down),
      with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being
      converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

                  (ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash
      Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds
      the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall
      Number"), then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right
      to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock
      Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

                        (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the
            number of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall
            be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and
            the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into
            the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
            number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
            multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such
            holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
            Number and the denominator of which is the total number of
            Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
            consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Non-Election
            Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
            such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to
            receive the Stock Consideration; or

                        (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
            Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
            into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election
            Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to
            receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock
            Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
            number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a
            fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the
            Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election
            Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock
            Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent
            with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Stock Election Shares
            shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
            holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to
            receive the Stock Consideration.

            1.6 Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards. (a) As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of Republic Common Stock
granted to employees or directors of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries under
any of the 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1998 Stock Option Plan, Voluntary Management
Stock Accumulation Plan, Incentive Stock Plan and Second Amended and Restated
Directors Compensation Plan, all as amended, and the award agreements thereunder
(collectively, the "Republic Stock Plans") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Republic Options") shall be converted
into an option (an "Adjusted Option") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions as applied to each such Republic Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such Republic
Options in accordance with the terms thereof, including terms approved by the
Republic board prior to the date of this Agreement as described on Section
1.6(a) of the Republic Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Article III of this
Agreement)), the number of whole shares of Citizens Common Stock that is equal
to the number of shares of Republic Common Stock subject to such Republic Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of
Citizens Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
exercise price for each such share of Republic Common Stock subject to such
Republic Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange
Ratio.

            (b) As of the Effective Time, each share of Republic Common Stock
granted to any employee or director of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries under
a Republic Stock Plan that is outstanding and subject to restrictions at the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Republic Restricted Shares") shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive, on the same terms and conditions as applied
to each such Republic Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including the same transfer restrictions), the number of whole shares of
Citizens Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Republic Common
Stock subject to such Republic Restricted Share immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) (the "Citizens Restricted Share Right"); provided, however, that,
upon the lapsing of restrictions with respect to each such Citizens Restricted
Share Right in accordance with the terms applicable to the corresponding
Republic Restricted Share as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Citizens shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Citizens Restricted
Share Right such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code and any applicable state or local tax law with respect to the lapsing
of such restrictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Republic Restricted
Share that is not subject to transfer restrictions as of the Effective Time,
based on actions taken by the Republic board prior to the date of this Agreement
(as described on Section 1.6(b) of the Republic Disclosure Schedule), shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less applicable
withholding) determined in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this
Agreement based on the holder's election in accordance with Section 2.1 of this
Agreement, and treating such Republic Restricted Shares in the same manner as
all other shares of Republic Common Stock for such purposes.

            (c) As of the Effective Time, each warrant with respect to shares of
Republic Common Stock granted to any employee or director of Republic or any of
its Subsidiaries under a Republic Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Republic Warrants") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into a warrant to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as
applied to each such Republic Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
(taking into account any accelerated vesting of such Republic Warrants in
accordance with the terms thereof, including terms approved by the Republic
board prior to the date of this Agreement, as described on Section 1.6(c) of the
Republic Disclosure Schedule), the number of whole shares of Citizens Common
Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Republic Common Stock subject to
such Republic Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price
per share of Citizens Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the exercise price for each such share of Republic Common Stock subject to
such Republic Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio (each a "Citizens Warrant").

            (d) As of the Effective Time, Citizens shall assume the obligations
and succeed to the rights of Republic under the Republic Stock Plans with
respect to the Adjusted Options, the Citizens Restricted Share Rights and the
Citizens Warrants. Republic and Citizens agree that prior to the Effective Time
each of the Republic Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent possible
without requiring shareholder approval of such amendments, (i) if and to the
extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the conversion of Republic
Options, Republic Restricted Shares, Republic Warrants granted to any employee
or director of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries under a Republic Stock Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above and the substitution of Citizens for Republic
thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such
Republic Stock Plans by Citizens and (ii) to preclude any automatic or formulaic
grant of options, restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or after the
date hereof. From and after the Effective Time, all references to Republic
(other than any references relating to a "change in control" of Republic) in
each Republic Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of Republic
Options or Republic Restricted Shares shall be deemed to refer to Citizens,
unless Citizens determines otherwise.

            (e) Citizens shall take all action reasonably necessary or
appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of
shares of Citizens Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted
Options or settlement of the Citizens Warrants. Within two Business Days of the
Closing Date, Citizens shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Citizens
Common Stock necessary to fulfill Citizens's obligations under this Section 1.6.

            1.7 Certificate of Incorporation of Citizens. At the Effective Time,
the Citizens Articles (as defined in Section 4.1(b)), as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law.

            1.8 Bylaws of Citizens. At the Effective Time, the Citizens By-laws
(as defined in Section 4.1(b)), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (but amended to include the Director Bylaw), shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law.

            1.9 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes
of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

                                   ARTICLE II

                        DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

            2.1 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of Republic
Common Stock ("Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following
procedures:

            (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.1 (herein called an "Election") (i) the number of
shares of Republic Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of
Republic Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Cash Election.

            (b) Citizens shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Republic
(the "Form of Election") which shall be mailed to record holders of Republic
Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise their right to make an
Election prior to the Election Deadline.

            (c) Citizens shall make the Form of Election initially available not
less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline
and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a
Form of Election to any shareholder of Republic who requests such Form of
Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the
Election Deadline.

            (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person
authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this
Agreement, which person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Citizens
and reasonably acceptable to Republic (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an
agreement (the "Exchange Agent Agreement") entered into prior to the mailing of
the Form of Election to Republic shareholders, shall have received, by the
Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by Certificates to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth
in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities
exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States; provided,
that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Republic
Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth
on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made
Election, unless otherwise determined by Citizens, in its sole discretion and
any shares of Republic Common Stock held by such Holder shall be deemed
Non-Election Shares. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the
parties, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which
the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the day prior to the
Republic Shareholders' Meeting or such other time and date as Citizens and
Republic may mutually agree. Republic and Citizens shall cooperate to issue a
press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least
five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline.

            (e) Any Republic shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Form of Election. Subject to the terms of the
Exchange Agent Agreement, if Citizens shall determine in its reasonable
discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of
Republic Common Stock (neither Citizens nor Republic nor the Exchange Agent
being under any duty to notify any shareholder of any such defect), such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Republic Common
Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be
Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

            (f) Any Republic shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election
Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall
be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from Citizens or Republic that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with Article VIII.

            (g) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Citizens,
in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i)
the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Republic shareholder
with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the manner and extent to
which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations
prescribed by Section 1.5, (iii) the issuance and delivery of certificates
representing the whole number of shares of Citizens Common Stock into which
shares of Republic Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iv) the method
of payment of cash for shares of Republic Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Citizens Common Stock.

            2.2 Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Citizens shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, (i) certificates representing the number of shares of Citizens Common
Stock sufficient to deliver, and Citizens shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii) immediately
available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the
extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.3(f)) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund") and Citizens shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash
in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.

            2.3 Delivery of Merger Consideration. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Republic Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Citizens Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not properly complete and
submit an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall
pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
such Certificate(s))) (the "Letter of Transmittal") to the Exchange Agent and
shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Citizens Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.3(f) upon surrender of
such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

            (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s),
accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Republic Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration (elected or
deemed elected by it, subject to, and in accordance with Sections 1.4 and 1.5)
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Citizens Common Stock to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Republic Common
Stock represented by its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Citizens Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with,
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to,
this Article II.

            (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Citizens
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Citizens Common Stock represented thereby, in each case
unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of
Citizens Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to shares of Citizens Common Stock represented by such
Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such
surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Citizens Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

            (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
representing Republic Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of Republic, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Citizens Common
Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such Republic Common Stock shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Citizens that the
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Citizens) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Citizens Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c) hereof and any other cash
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Republic
Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Citizens, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Citizens, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Republic Common Stock
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent
or Citizens, as the case may be.

            (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Republic of any shares of Republic Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Republic Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Citizens Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
in accordance with Section 1.5 and the procedures set forth in this Article II.

            (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Citizens
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Citizens Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Citizens. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Citizens shall pay to each former shareholder of Republic who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Citizens Closing Price by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Republic
Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Citizens Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4.

            (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Republic as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be paid to Citizens. Any former shareholders of Republic who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Citizens
with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Citizens Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Republic Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Citizens, Republic, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Republic Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

            (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Citizens or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Citizens may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF REPUBLIC

            Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule (the "Republic
Disclosure Schedule") delivered by Republic to Citizens prior to the execution
of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among other things, items, the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate, either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this Article
III, or to one or more of Republic's covenants, provided, however, that
disclosure in any section of such Republic Disclosure Schedule shall apply only
to the indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to another section of this
Agreement), Republic hereby represents and warrants to Citizens as follows:

            3.1 Corporate Organization. (a) Republic is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Michigan. Republic has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business, in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic. As used
in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse
Change" means, with respect to Citizens, Republic or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, an effect, event, development or change (a) which is
materially adverse to the business, results of operations or financial condition
of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided that none of the
following shall be deemed, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and
none of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or will be a Material Adverse Effect or a Material Adverse Change: any
effect, event, development or change primarily arising out of or resulting from
(A) changes, after the date hereof, in generally accepted accounting principles
or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks or savings
associations and their holding companies generally, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global or national political conditions or in general U.S.
or global economic or market conditions affecting banks or their holding
companies generally (including changes in interest or exchange rates) except to
the extent that any such changes have a disproportionate adverse effect on such
party, (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the impact thereof on customers, suppliers, licensors and employees, or (E) the
commencement, occurrence, continuation or intensification of any war, sabotage,
armed hostilities or acts of terrorism not directly involving the properties or
assets of the applicable person or its Subsidiaries; or (b) would prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of Republic or Citizens to
perform its obligations hereunder.

            (b) Republic is duly registered as a bank holding company under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). True, complete and
correct copies of the Third Restated Articles of Incorporation of Republic, as
amended (the "Republic Articles"), and the By-laws of Republic (the "Republic
By-laws"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been
made available to Citizens.

            (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, each Republic
Subsidiary (i) is duly incorporated or duly formed, as applicable to each such
Subsidiary, and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where
its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it
to be so licensed or qualified and (iii) has all requisite corporate power or
other power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted. The articles of incorporation, by-laws and
similar governing documents of each Republic Subsidiary, copies of which have
previously been made available to Citizens, are true, complete and correct
copies of such documents as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to either party, means
any bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, that is consolidated with
such party for financial reporting purposes under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"), and the terms "Republic Subsidiary" and

relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information

modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all
Republic SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. No executive
officer of Republic has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of

fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,

involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The books and records of Republic and its Subsidiaries have been, and
are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Ernst & Young LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Republic as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with Republic on a matter of accounting principles or

are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Republic
included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31,
2006 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2006 or in

            (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Republic

on Republic. Republic (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Republic, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Republic by others within those entities, and (y) has

Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Republic's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Republic's internal
controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by
management to Republic's auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously
been made available to Citizens. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to
believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

            (d) Since December 31, 2005, (i) through the date hereof, neither

directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Republic or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Republic.

Republic and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable laws,
statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines of any Governmental
Entity relating to labor, employment, termination of employment or similar
matters and have not engaged in any unfair labor practices or similar prohibited
practices.

            3.12 Compliance with Applicable Law. (a) Republic and each Republic
Subsidiary holds all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to
each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any
respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or
guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to Republic or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations, or such non-compliance or default, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic.

            (b) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Republic has been
and is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. Section 3.12(b) of Republic
Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, a schedule of all
executive officers and directors of Republic who have outstanding loans from
Republic, and there has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in
whole or in part, any such loan during the two years immediately preceding the
date hereof.

            3.13 Certain Contracts. (a) Except as set forth on Section 3.13(a)
of the Republic Disclosure Schedule, neither Republic nor any Republic
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of
any directors, officers, employees or consultants, other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) that provides for
indemnification of any director, officer or employee of Republic, (iii) which,
upon execution of this Agreement or consummation or shareholder approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment or benefits
(whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from Citizens, Republic,
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
officer or employee of Republic or any Subsidiary thereof, (iv) that is or
includes any non-competition, non-solicitation or exclusive dealing agreement or
obligation, or any other agreement or obligation that purports to limit or
restrict in any respect (A) the ability of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries
to solicit customers or employees or (B) the manner in which, or the localities
in which, all or any portion of the business and operations of Republic or its
Subsidiaries or, following consummation of the Merger, the business and
operations of Citizens and its Subsidiaries, is or could be conducted, (v) that
relates to the incurrence of Indebtedness (other than deposit liabilities,
advances and loans from a Federal Home Loan Bank, and sales of securities
subject to repurchase, in each case in the ordinary course of business) in the
principal amount of $2.5 million or more, (vi) that grants any person a right of
first refusal, right of first offer or similar right with respect to any
material properties, assets or businesses of Republic or its Subsidiaries, (vii)
that is a consulting agreement or service contract (including data processing,
software programming and licensing contracts and outsourcing contracts for the
provision of collection and other services in connection with the business and
operations of Republic and its Subsidiaries) involving the payment of annual
fees of $250,000 or more, or (viii) that is a "material contract" (as such term
is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed
after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by
reference in Republic SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof. As used
herein, "Indebtedness" of a person shall mean (i) all obligations of such person
for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations of such person evidenced by bonds,
debentures, notes and similar instruments, (iii) all leases of such person
capitalized in accordance with GAAP, and (iv) all obligations of such person
under sale-and-lease back transactions, agreements to repurchase securities sold
and other similar financing transactions. Each contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding of the type described in this Section 3.13, whether or not set
forth in Republic Disclosure Schedule, is referred to as a "Republic Contract,"
and neither Republic nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received
notice of, any violation of any Republic Contract by any of the other parties
thereto. Section 3.13(a) of the Republic Disclosure Schedule accurately
categorizes each of the Republic Contracts according to the applicable clause(s)
of the definition of Company Material Contracts. Republic has made available
true and complete copies of each (i) Republic Contract and (ii) each contract or
agreement that involved payments by Republic or its Subsidiaries in fiscal year
2005 of more than $250,000 or which could reasonably be expected to involve
payments during fiscal year 2006 or 2007 of more than $250,000 other than where
such contract or agreement was or is terminable at will on 60 days or less
notice without payment of a penalty in excess of $50,000.

            (b) Each Republic Contract is valid and binding on Republic or its
applicable Subsidiary and is in full force and effect. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic, (i) each Republic Contract is accurately categorized
in Section 3.13(a) of the Republic Disclosure Schedule according to the
applicable clause(s) of the definition of Republic Contracts, (ii) Republic and
each Republic Subsidiary has in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by it to date under each Republic Contract, and (iii)
no event or condition exists that constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time
or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of Republic or any of
its Subsidiaries under any such Republic Contract.

            3.14 Risk Management Instruments. (a) "Derivative Transactions"
means any swap transaction, option, warrant, forward purchase or sale
transaction, futures transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction or collar
transaction relating to one or more currencies, commodities, bonds, equity
securities, loans, interest rates, events or conditions (credit-related or
otherwise) or any indexes, or any other similar transaction or combination of
any of these transactions, and any collateralized debt obligations or other
similar instruments or any debt or equity instruments evidencing or embedding
any such types of transactions, and any related credit support, collateral or
other similar arrangements related to such transactions; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the term "Derivative Transactions" shall not include any
Republic Stock Option.

            (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, (i) all Derivative
Transactions that are currently outstanding (which for the avoidance of doubt
shall not include any Republic Stock Option), whether entered into for the
account of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary or for the account of a customer
of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary, were duly authorized by Republic and
entered into by Republic and, to the knowledge of Republic, the counterparties
thereto in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable laws, rules, regulations
and policies of any Regulatory Authority and in accordance with the investment,
securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures employed by Republic and its Subsidiaries, and with counterparties
believed at the time to be financially responsible and able to understand
(either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of
such Derivative Transactions; (ii) all of such Derivative Transactions are
legal, valid and binding obligations of Republic or a Republic Subsidiary
enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity),
and are in full force and effect; and (iii) Republic and each applicable
Republic Subsidiary have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative
Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to
the knowledge of Republic, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

            3.15 Investment Securities. (a) Each of Republic and each Republic
Subsidiary has good title to all securities owned by it (except those sold under
repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and
clear of any Lien, except to the extent such securities are pledged in the
ordinary course of business to secure obligations of Republic or its
Subsidiaries. Such securities are valued on the books of Republic in accordance
with GAAP in all material respects.

            (b) Republic and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses
employ investment, securities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures (the "Policies, Practices and Procedures") which Republic believes
are prudent and reasonable in the context of such businesses. Prior to the date
hereof, Republic has made available to Citizens in writing the material
Policies, Practices and Procedures.

            3.16 Loan Portfolio. (a) Section 3.16(a) of the Republic Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of
December 31, 2005, of all written or oral loan agreements, notes or borrowing
arrangements (including leases, credit enhancements, commitments, guarantees and
interest-bearing assets) payable to Republic or its Subsidiaries (collectively,
"Loans"), other than "non-accrual" Loans, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount, as of December 31, 2005, of all "non-accrual" Loans. As of
December 31, 2005, Republic and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, did not have
outstanding Loans and assets classified as "Other Real Estate Owned" with an
aggregate then outstanding, fully committed principal amount in excess of that
amount set forth on Section 3.16(a) of the Republic Disclosure Schedule, net of
specific reserves with respect to such Loans and assets, that were designated as
of such date by Republic as "Watch", "Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss", or words
of similar import ("Problem Loans"). Section 3.16(a) of the Republic Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (A) a summary of Problem Loans of Republic as of December
31, 2005, by category of Loan (e.g., commercial, consumer, etc.), together with
the aggregate principal amount of such Loans by category and the amount of
specific reserves with respect to each such category of Loan and the amount of
reserves with respect to each such category of Loans and (B) each asset of
Republic or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of December 31, 2005, is classified
as "Other Real Estate Owned" and the book value thereof.

            (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, each Loan (i) is
evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness which are
true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been
secured by valid liens and security interests which have been perfected and
(iii) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity).
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, all Loans originated by
Republic or its Subsidiaries, and all such Loans purchased, administered or
serviced by Republic or its Subsidiaries (including Loans held for resale to
investors), were made or purchased and are administered or serviced, as
applicable, in accordance with customary lending standards of Republic or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (and in the case of Loans held for resale to
investors, the lending standards, if any, of such investors) and in accordance
with applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules. All such
Loans (and any related guarantees) and payments due thereunder are, and on the
Closing Date will be, free and clear of any Lien, and Republic or its
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects, and on the Closing Date will
have complied in all material respects, with all laws and regulations relating
to such Loans.

            (c) None of the agreements pursuant to which Republic or any of its
Subsidiaries has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or
pools of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests
therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.

            (d) Each of Republic and each Republic Subsidiary, as applicable, is
approved by and is in good standing (i) as a supervised mortgagee by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development to originate and service Title I FHA
mortgage loans; (ii) as a GNMA I and II Issuer by the Government National
Mortgage Association; (iii) by the Department of Veteran's Affairs to originate
and service VA loans; and (iv) as a seller/servicer by the Federal National
Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to originate
and service conventional residential mortgage Loans (each such entity being
referred to herein as an "Agency" and, collectively, the "Agencies").

            (e) None of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it
ever been since December 31, 2004 subject to any material fine, suspension,
settlement or other agreement or other administrative agreement or sanction by,
or any material reduction in any loan purchase commitment from any Agency or any
federal or state agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of
mortgage or consumer Loans. Neither Republic nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice, nor does it have any reason to believe, that any Agency
proposes to limit or terminate the underwriting authority of Republic or any of
its Subsidiaries or to increase the guarantee fees payable to any such Agency.

            (f) To the knowledge of Republic, each Loan included in a pool of
Loans originated, acquired or serviced by Republic or any of its Subsidiaries (a
"Republic Pool") meets all eligibility requirements (including all applicable
requirements for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and loan guaranty
certificates) for inclusion in such Republic Pool. All such Republic Pools have
been finally certified or, if required, recertified in accordance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, except where the time for certification
or recertification has not yet expired. To the knowledge of Republic, no
Republic Pools have been improperly certified, and no Loan has been bought out
of a Republic Pool without all required approvals of the applicable investors.

            3.17 Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic,
Republic or a Republic Subsidiary (a) has good and marketable title to all the
properties and assets reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in
Republic SEC Reports as being owned by Republic or a Republic Subsidiary or
acquired after the date thereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of
since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business) (the "Republic Owned
Properties"), free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except (i)
statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (ii) Liens for real property
Taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) easements, rights of way, and other similar
encumbrances that do not materially affect the use of the properties or assets
subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties and (iv) such imperfections or irregularities of
title or Liens as do not materially affect the use of the properties or assets
subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties (collectively, "Permitted Encumbrances"), and (b)
is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial
statements included in such Republic SEC Reports or acquired after the date
thereof (except for leases that have expired by their terms since the date
thereof) (the "Republic Leased Properties" and, collectively with the Republic
Owned Properties, the "Republic Real Property"), free and clear of all Liens of
any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in possession
of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is
valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the knowledge of Republic,
the lessor. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Republic, threatened
condemnation proceedings against the Republic Real Property. Republic and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable health and safety related
requirements for the Republic Real Property, including those under the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational Health and Safety Act of
1970.

            3.18 Intellectual Property. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic, (a) Republic and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use
(in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all Intellectual Property used in
or necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted; (b) the use
of any Intellectual Property by Republic and its Subsidiaries does not, to the
knowledge of Republic, infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any person
and is in accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Republic or
any Republic Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property; (c)
no person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of
Republic or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by and/or licensed to Republic or its Subsidiaries; (d) neither Republic
nor any Republic Subsidiary has received any written notice of any pending claim
with respect to any Intellectual Property used by Republic or any Republic
Subsidiary and no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Republic or any
Republic Subsidiary is being used or enforced in a manner that would be expected
to result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
Intellectual Property. For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property"
means trademarks, service marks, brand names, certification marks, trade dress
and other indications of origin, the goodwill associated with the foregoing and
registrations in any jurisdiction of, and applications in any jurisdiction to
register, the foregoing, including any extension, modification or renewal of any
such registration or application; inventions, discoveries and ideas, whether
patentable or not, in any jurisdiction; patents, applications for patents

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic, (a) there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,
claims, actions, causes of action or notices with respect to any environmental,
health or safety matters or any private or governmental environmental, health or
safety investigations or remediation activities of any nature seeking to impose,
or that are reasonably likely to result in, any liability or obligation of
Republic or any of its Subsidiaries arising under common law or under any local,
state or federal environmental, health or safety statute, regulation or
ordinance, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Republic or any
of its Subsidiaries; (b) to the knowledge of Republic, there is no reasonable
basis for, or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to, any such
proceeding, claim, action, investigation or remediation by any Governmental
Entity or any third party that would give rise to any liability or obligation on
the part of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries; and (c) neither Republic nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree,
letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing
any liability or obligation with respect to any of the foregoing.

            3.20 State Takeover Laws. The Board of Directors of Republic has

Republic (a) is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b) knows of no reason why all
regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be obtained on a
timely basis.

has received an opinion from Goldman, Sachs & Co. to the effect that as of the
date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the matters set forth in such

a true, correct and complete copy of such opinion for informational purposes
promptly following receipt thereof by Republic.

            3.23 Republic Information. The information relating to Republic and
its Subsidiaries that is provided by Republic or its representatives for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or in any other

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CITIZENS

            Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule (the "Citizens
Disclosure Schedule") delivered by Citizens to Republic prior to the execution

            4.2 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of Citizens

number of shares of Citizens Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding Citizens Options under Citizens Stock Plans as of the Citizens
Capitalization Date, the aggregate number of Citizens Options that are vested or

or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance
of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary
or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any

            4.3 Authority; No Violation. (a) Citizens has full corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly,
validly and unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Citizens. The
Board of Directors of Citizens has determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of
Citizens and its shareholders, has directed that this Agreement be submitted to
Citizens's shareholders for approval and adoption at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders, has determined to recommend such approval and has adopted a
resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for the approval of Citizens
shareholders required pursuant to the rules of The Nasdaq National Market for
the issuance of shares of Citizens Common Stock pursuant to Article I (the
"Stock Issuance"), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Citizens are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Citizens and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
Republic) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Citizens, enforceable
against Citizens in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity).

            (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Citizens, nor the consummation by Citizens of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Citizens with any of the terms or provisions of this

Disclosure Schedule, no payment made or to be made in respect of any employee or
former employee of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries is or will be
nondeductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

            (g) Neither Citizens nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any labor or collective bargaining agreement and there are no
organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization activities seeking
recognition of a collective bargaining unit with respect to, or otherwise
attempting to represent, any of the employees of Citizens or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no labor related controversies, strikes, slowdowns,
walkouts or other work stoppages pending or, to the knowledge of Citizens,
threatened and neither Citizens nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any
such labor related controversy, strike, slowdown, walkout or other work stoppage
within the past three years. Neither Citizens nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any
Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices. Each of
Citizens and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable laws,
statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines of any Governmental
Entity relating to labor, employment, termination of employment or similar
matters and have not engaged in any unfair labor practices or similar prohibited
practices.

            4.21 Loan Portfolio. (a) Section 4.21(a) of the Citizens Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of
December 31, 2005, of all Loans, other than "non-accrual" Loans, and (ii) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of December 31, 2005, of all
"non-accrual" Loans. As of December 31, 2005, Citizens and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, did not have outstanding Loans and assets classified as "Other
Real Estate Owned" with an aggregate then outstanding, fully committed principal
amount in excess of that amount set forth on Section 4.21(a) of the Citizens
Disclosure Schedule, net of specific reserves with respect to such Loans and
assets, that were designated as of such date by Citizens as "Other Loans
Specifically Mentioned", "Special Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss",
or words of similar import ("Criticized Assets"). Section 4.21(a) of the
Citizens Disclosure Schedule sets forth (A) a summary of Criticized Assets of
Citizens as of December 31, 2005, by category of Loan (e.g., commercial,
consumer, etc.), together with the aggregate principal amount of such Loans by
category and the amount of specific reserves with respect to each such category
of Loan and the amount of reserves with respect to each such category of Loans
and (B) each asset of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of December
31, 2005, is classified as "Other Real Estate Owned" and the book value thereof.

            (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Citizens, each Loan (i) is
evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness which are
true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been
secured by valid liens and security interests which have been perfected and
(iii) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity).
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Citizens, all Loans originated by
Citizens or its Subsidiaries, and all such Loans purchased, administered or
serviced by Citizens or its Subsidiaries (including Loans held for resale to
investors), were made or purchased and are administered or serviced, as
applicable, in accordance with customary lending standards of Citizens or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (and in the case of Loans held for resale to
investors, the lending standards, if any, of such investors) and in accordance
with applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules. All such
Loans (and any related guarantees) and payments due thereunder are, and on the
Closing Date will be, free and clear of any Lien, and Citizens or its
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects, and on the Closing Date will
have complied in all material respects, with all laws and regulations relating
to such Loans.

            (c) None of the agreements pursuant to which Citizens or any of its
Subsidiaries has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or
pools of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests
therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.

            (d) Each of Citizens and each Citizens Subsidiary, as applicable, is
approved by and is in good standing, as applicable, with the Agencies.

            (e) None of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it
ever been since December 31, 2004 subject to any material fine, suspension,
settlement or other agreement or other administrative agreement or sanction by,
or any material reduction in any loan purchase commitment from any Agency or any
federal or state agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of
mortgage or consumer Loans. Neither Citizens nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice, nor does it have any reason to believe, that any Agency
proposes to limit or terminate the underwriting authority of Citizens or any of
its Subsidiaries or to increase the guarantee fees payable to any such Agency.

            (f) To the knowledge of Citizens, each Loan included in a pool of
Loans originated, acquired or serviced by Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries (a
"Citizens Pool") meets all eligibility requirements (including all applicable
requirements for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and loan guaranty
certificates) for inclusion in such Citizens Pool. All such Citizens Pools have
been finally certified or, if required, recertified in accordance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, except where the time for certification
or recertification has not yet expired. To the knowledge of Citizens, no
Citizens Pools have been improperly certified, and no Loan has been bought out
of a Citizens Pool without all required approvals of the applicable investors.

            4.22 Certain Contracts.

            (a) "Citizens Contract" shall mean any contract, arrangement,

material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to
date under each Citizens Contract, and (ii) no event or condition exists that
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default on the part of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such Citizens Contract.

            6.1 Regulatory Matters. (a) Citizens and Republic shall promptly

            (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and

or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties,
Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Entities. Republic and Citizens shall have
the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, all the information relating to Republic or
Citizens, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which

necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters

require Citizens to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to
any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities, that

scale relative to Republic) on either Citizens or Republic (a "Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition").

            (c) Each of Citizens and Republic shall, upon request, furnish to
the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Citizens,
Republic or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            (d) Each of Citizens and Republic shall promptly advise the other
upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental
Entity consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Citizens Requisite Regulatory
Approval or Republic Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

            (e) Republic shall cooperate with such reasonable requests as may be
made by Citizens with respect to any post-Closing reorganization of Citizens's
and Republic's Subsidiaries, including filing prior to the Closing such
applications with Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Entities as may be
necessary or desirable in connection with any such reorganization.

            6.2 Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of Republic
and Citizens shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all reasonably requested
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period,
such party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the
other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance
laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request.
Neither Republic nor Citizens, nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries
or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

            (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the parties as of May 5, 2006 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement. In the event of
any conflict between the terms of this Section 6.2(b) and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
control.

            (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this
Agreement.

            6.3 Shareholder Approvals. Each of Republic and Citizens shall call
a meeting of its shareholders (the "Republic Shareholders' Meeting" and the
"Citizens Shareholders' Meeting," as applicable) to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder
approvals required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of
Republic and Citizens shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
respective shareholders the shareholder vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement or the Stock Issuance, respectively, required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Republic and
Citizens agree that they have an unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement
to their respective shareholders at their respective shareholder meetings.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Republic
or Citizens shall adjourn or postpone the Republic Shareholders' Meeting or
Citizens Shareholders' Meeting, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement
is provided to their respective shareholders, in advance of a vote on, in the
case of Citizens, the Stock Issuance and, in the case of Republic, the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, or, if, as of the time for which
the Citizens Shareholders' Meeting or the Republic Shareholders' Meeting, as the
case may be, is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Citizens
Common Stock or Republic Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if in the reasonable good faith determination of either
Citizens or Republic additional time is needed to solicit an affirmative
shareholder vote by the Citizens shareholders in order to obtain the approval of
the Stock Issuance, or the Republic shareholders in order to obtain the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, as the case may be.

            6.4 Affiliates. Republic shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate"
(for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Republic to deliver to
Citizens, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to
the date of the meeting of Republic shareholders to be held pursuant to Section
6.3, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit C.

            6.5 Nasdaq Listing. Citizens shall cause the shares of Citizens
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on the
Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

            6.6 Employee Matters.

            (a) Citizens and its Subsidiaries shall employ as of the Closing
Date those employees who are employed by Republic or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Covered Employees"). For the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2006, the Surviving
Corporation shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to the
Covered Employees employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Covered Employees under the
Republic Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that severance benefits will be provided to such Covered Employees
under the new severance plan to be implemented as of the Effective Time in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is the
intention of Citizens, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to develop new
benefit plans (or amend existing benefit plans of Citizens and/or Republic) (the
"New Benefit Plans"), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time. Once established, on a going forward basis, such new benefit plans shall
(i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis,
taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location,
tenure, qualifications and abilities and (ii) not discriminate between the
Surviving Corporation Employees who were covered by Republic benefit plans, on
the one hand, and those covered by Citizens benefit plans on the other, at the
Effective Time. In order to avoid a lapse in participation, prior to the time
that any such New Benefit Plans are established, Covered Employees shall either
continue to participate in the Republic Benefit Plans or shall participate in
one or more of the Citizens Benefit Plans, it being understood that the Covered
Employees may commence participating in the New Benefit Plans on different dates
following the Closing Date.

            (b) Except as provided below, Citizens shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to give all Covered Employees full credit for such employees'
service with Republic or any Republic Subsidiary, to the same extent recognized
by Republic or any Republic Subsidiary for comparable purposes under the
Republic Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, for all
purposes(including, without limitation, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits and levels of benefits) of
any employee benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation in which such Covered
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time (with respect
to a new plan, to the extent past service credit is taken into account under the
applicable new plan for any eligible employee, including legacy Citizens
employees), and for purposes of determining seniority in connection with
employment at Citizens or its subsidiaries, except to the extent that such
crediting of service would result in duplication of benefits and provided that
no prior service shall be recognized for any purpose under (A) any defined
benefit plan or (B) any frozen post-retirement welfare plan. With respect to any
health, dental, vision plan, life or long-term disability benefit plans or
arrangements of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Republic and its
Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the
plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible to
participate, Citizens shall (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations
under such Citizens or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered
Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under
the Republic Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise take all necessary and
appropriate steps to ensure that such Covered Employee shall not suffer a lapse
in health, dental, vision, life or long-term disability plan coverage in
connection with the Merger, and (y) recognize any medical or other health
expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing
Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Citizens or any of
its Subsidiaries.

            (c) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall take
all action necessary to effectuate the agreements set forth in Section 6.6(c) of
the Citizens Disclosure Schedule.

            (d) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor
in accordance with their terms all Republic Benefit Plans, provided that nothing
herein will prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending any such agreement
or plan in accordance with its terms, including such amendments as may be
necessary to avoid the imposition of a Tax under Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this
Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time
for, or preclude the ability of either party to terminate, any Surviving
Corporation Employee for any reason or (ii) require the Surviving Corporation to
continue any Republic Benefit Plan or Citizens Benefit Plan, or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time to the
extent permitted by their terms and applicable law.

            6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) From
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, any individual who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary or
who is or was serving at the request of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary as a
director or officer of another person (the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including fees and expenses of
counsel), fines, penalties, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a
"Claim") based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of Republic or any
Subsidiary of Republic, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or
any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken
at the request of Citizens pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party
as provided in the certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) of Republic or any Republic Subsidiary, and
any existing indemnification agreements including those set forth in Section 6.7
of Republic Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, it being understood that
nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

            (b) Citizens and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the
defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. To
the extent permitted by applicable law, Citizens shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (and not reasonably
objected to by Citizens), promptly after statements therefor are received, and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, Citizens shall have the burden of proof to establish that the Indemnified
Party's conduct did not comply with the standards set forth under applicable Law
and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to a hearing before a court of
competent jurisdiction with respect to such matter should Citizens claim that
the Indemnified Party's conduct did not comply with the standards set forth
under applicable Law and all costs and expenses of such hearing (including those
of the Indemnified Party) shall be paid by Citizens and such Indemnified Party
in proportion to the relative success of Citizens and such Indemnified Party
(where, e.g., the party whose position succeeds in its entirety shall not be
required to bear any of such costs and expenses).

            (c) Citizens shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time
by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by
Republic (provided that Citizens may substitute therefor policies with one or
more reputable unaffiliated third-party insurers of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such; provided that in no event shall Citizens be required to expend
annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums
currently paid by Republic (which current amount is set forth in Section 6.7 of
the Republic Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"),
and provided further that if Citizens is unable to maintain such policy (or such
substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Citizens shall obtain
as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

            (d) If Citizens or the Citizens or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Citizens or surviving entity, as the case may be, shall assume all of
the obligations of Citizens set forth in this Section.

            (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section shall be
in addition to any right such person might have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Republic or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
applicable law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with Republic or
any of its Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their respective heirs and representatives.

            (f) The obligations of Citizens under this Section shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to
whom this Section applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section applies shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this Section).

            (g) Citizens shall indemnify any Indemnified Party against all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
this Section, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Party's rights
under this Section or under the amended certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or existing indemnification agreements, but only to the extent that such
Indemnified Party is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder. Any amounts due pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be payable upon request by the Indemnified Party.

            6.8 Additional Agreements. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Republic and Citizens agree to cooperate fully with
each other and to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger.

            (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of Citizens, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of Republic, on the other) or to vest Citizens with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party
to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their
respective Subsidiaries shall, at Citizens's sole expense, take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Citizens.

            6.9 Advice of Changes. Subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, each of Citizens and Republic shall promptly
advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided
further that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article
VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied.

            6.10 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the
Effective Time, Citizens and Republic shall each take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Republic Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
Republic Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom, LLP.

            6.11 No Solicitation by Republic. (a) Republic and its Subsidiaries
shall not, and Republic shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit any
officer or director of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall not
authorize any other person to (and any such authorizations currently existing
have been terminated), directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage,
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action
designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share
exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock
(including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar
transactions involving Republic or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated,
would constitute a Republic Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing
inquiries or proposals, including any indication of an intention to propose any
of the foregoing, if with respect to Republic, being referred to herein as a
"Republic Alternative Proposal" and if with respect to a company generally, then
an "Alternative Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding a Republic Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement
regarding any Republic Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of Republic shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of
Republic shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.11 and to first entering into
an agreement with the person proposing such Republic Alternative Proposal on
terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Republic than, those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to respond to, furnish information
with respect to and consider and participate in any discussions or negotiations
with respect to, any bona fide Republic Alternative Proposal received in writing
by Republic, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of Republic
reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that the failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties. Upon having received a Republic Alternative Proposal, the Board of
Directors of Republic may withdraw or modify its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors
of Republic reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties (provided that the foregoing shall not relieve Republic of its obligation
to submit this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders as provided herein,
or to rescind or amend the resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted in
approving this Agreement).

            As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means, with
respect to a company any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or
group of persons) (other than Citizens or its affiliates, in the case of
Republic) directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the
outstanding shares of such company or any of its Subsidiaries or outstanding
voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be
entitled to a class or series vote with respect to a merger of such company or
any of its Subsidiaries whether from such company or any of its Subsidiaries or
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share
exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving such company or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant
to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Citizens or its
affiliates, in the case of Republic) acquires or would acquire control of assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of
such company and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business
combination including any of such company's Subsidiaries) of such company, or
any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of
all the assets, net revenues or net income of such company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving such company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. An Alternative Transaction with respect to
Republic is referred to as a "Republic Alternative Transaction" and an
Alternative Transaction with respect to Citizens is referred to as a "Citizens
Alternative Transaction."

            (b) Republic shall notify Citizens promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any Republic Alternative Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Republic Alternative
Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to Republic or any
of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
Republic or any Subsidiary by any person or entity that informs the Board of
Directors of Republic or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has
made, a Republic Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Citizens shall be made
orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the
Republic Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making a
Republic Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to
the books and records of Republic or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of
any such Republic Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to a
Republic Alternative Proposal. Republic shall keep Citizens fully informed, on a
current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the terms of any such Republic Alternative Proposal, indication
or request. Republic shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours,
notify Citizens, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Republic Alternative Proposal in accordance with
Section 6.11(a).

            (c) Republic and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
(other than each other) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than
the other party hereto who have been furnished confidential information
regarding itself in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding
a Republic Alternative Proposal, as the case may be, within the 12 months prior
to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information.

            (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit Republic
or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            6.12 No Solicitation by Citizens. (a) Citizens and its Subsidiaries
shall not, and Citizens shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit any
officer or director of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall not
authorize any other person to (and any such authorizations currently existing
have been terminated), directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage,
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action
designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any Alternative
Proposal (a "Citizens Alternative Proposal"), (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding a Citizens Alternative Transaction or
(iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Citizens Alternative Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Citizens shall be
permitted, prior to the meeting of Citizens shareholders to be held pursuant to
Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.12
and to first entering into an agreement with the person proposing such Citizens
Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
Citizens than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to respond to,
furnish information with respect to and consider and participate in discussions
with respect to, any bona fide Citizens Alternative Proposal received in writing
by Citizens, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of Citizens
reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that the failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties. Upon having received a Citizens Alternative Proposal, the Board of
Directors of Citizens may withdraw or modify its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors
of Citizens reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties (provided that the foregoing shall not relieve Citizens of its obligation
to submit the Stock Issuance to its shareholders as provided herein, or to
rescind or amend the resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted in approving
this Agreement).

            (b) Citizens shall notify Republic promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any Citizens Alternative Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Citizens Alternative
Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to Citizens or any
of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
Citizens or any Subsidiary by any person or entity that informs the Board of
Directors of Citizens or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has
made, a Citizens Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Republic shall be made
orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the
Citizens Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making a
Citizens Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to
the books and records of Citizens or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of
any such Citizens Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to a
Citizens Alternative Proposal. Citizens shall keep Republic fully informed, on a
current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or
modifications in the terms of any such Citizens Alternative Proposal, indication
or request. Citizens shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours,
notify Republic, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Citizens Alternative Proposal in accordance with
Section 6.12(a).

            (c) Citizens and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
(other than each other) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than
the other party hereto who have been furnished confidential information
regarding itself in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding
a Citizens Alternative Proposal, as the case may be, within the 12 months prior
to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information.

            (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.12 shall prohibit Citizens
or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            6.13 Coordination of Dividends. After the date of this Agreement,
each of Citizens and Republic shall coordinate with the other the declaration of
any dividends in respect of Citizens Common Stock and Republic Common Stock and
the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties that holders of Republic Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to
their shares of Republic Common Stock and any shares of Citizens Common Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

            6.14 Certain Tax Matters. The parties intend the Merger to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and each of
Citizens and Republic and each of their respective Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify and to obtain
the opinions of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Citizens, and
Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, counsel to Republic, described in Sections
7.2(c) and 7.3(c), respectively. Except as required pursuant to a
"determination" (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code), no party hereto will
take any Tax reporting position (whether on a Tax Return or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

            6.15 Certain Post-Closing Matters.

            (a) Board and Committee Composition; Chairmanships.

                  (i) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
      of Citizens shall (i) adopt a bylaw, effective as of the Effective Time,
      in the form attached as Exhibit B (the "Director Bylaw"), and (ii) cause
      the Board of Directors of Citizens, effective as of the Effective Time, to
      consist of sixteen (16) directors, including nine (9) continuing members
      of the Citizens Board (including William R. Hartman) ("Citizens Continuing
      Directors"), and seven (7) members of the Republic Board of Directors
      selected by Republic and reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors
      of Citizens (including Jerry D. Campbell and Dana M. Cluckey) ("Republic
      Appointees");

                  (ii) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
      of Citizens Bank Wealth Management, N.A. shall cause its Board of
      Directors, effective as of the Effective Time, to consist of fourteen (14)
      directors, including eight (8) Citizens Continuing Directors and six (6)

            8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Republic or Citizens:

                  (a) by mutual consent of Republic and Citizens in a written
      instrument authorized by the boards of directors of Republic and Citizens,
      as determined by a vote of a majority of the members of each respective
      entire board of directors;

                  (b) by either Republic or Citizens, if any Governmental Entity
      that must grant a Citizens Requisite Regulatory Approval or a Republic
      Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such
      denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of
      competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order
      permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

                  (c) by either Republic or Citizens, if the Merger shall not
      have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of
      this Agreement unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
      shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
      Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
      set forth in this Agreement;

                  (d) by either Citizens or Republic (provided that the
      terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
      warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall
      have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
      representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
      Republic, in the case of a termination by Citizens, or Citizens, in the
      case of a termination by Republic, which breach, either individually or in
      the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing
      Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as
      the case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days following written
      notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing
      cannot be cured within such time period;

                  (e) by Citizens, if (i) Republic shall have materially
      breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.11, or (ii) the
      Board of Directors of Republic shall have (A) failed to recommend in the
      Joint Proxy Statement the adoption of the agreement of merger set forth in
      this Agreement, (B) publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced
      its intention to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Citizens,
      its recommendation that its shareholders approve or adopt this Agreement
      or (C) recommended any Republic Alternative Proposal or fail to recommend
      against any publicly disclosed Republic Alternative Proposal within the 10
      business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or,
      in the case of clause (ii), resolved to take any such action), whether or
      not permitted by the terms hereof;

                  (f) by Republic, if (i) Citizens shall have materially
      breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.12, or (ii) the
      Board of Directors of Citizens shall have (A) failed to recommend in the
      Joint Proxy Statement the approval of the Stock Issuance, (B) publicly
      withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced its intention to withdraw or
      modify, in any manner adverse to Republic, its recommendation that its
      shareholders approve or adopt this Agreement or (C) recommended any
      Citizens Alternative Proposal or fail to recommend against any Citizens
      Alternative Proposal within the 10 business day period specified in Rule
      14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or, in the case of clause (ii), resolved
      to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the terms hereof;

                  (g) by either Republic or Citizens if any approval of the
      shareholders of Republic or Citizens contemplated by this Agreement shall
      not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
      vote at the Republic Shareholders' Meeting or the Citizens Shareholders'
      Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of either such meeting; or

                  (h) by Republic, if the Board of Directors of Republic so
      determines by the vote of a majority of all of its members, by giving
      written notice to Citizens not later than the end of the second Business
      Day next following the Determination Date, in the event that, as of the
      Determination Date, both of the following conditions are satisfied:

                        (i) (A) the Final Aggregate Consideration shall be less
            than (B) the product of 0.85 times the Initial Aggregate
            Consideration; and

                        (ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average
            Closing Price by the Citizens Starting Price (such number, the
            "Citizens Ratio") is less than (B) the number obtained by dividing
            the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price and subtracting
            0.1765 from such quotient (such number, the "Index Ratio").

                  If Republic elects to exercise its termination right pursuant
      to this Section 8.1(h), it shall give written notice to Citizens. During
      the five-business-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice,
      Citizens may, at its option (the "Fill Option"), (A) adjust the Share
      Ratio to equal the lesser of (1) the number (rounded to the nearest
      one-ten-thousandth) that would cause the Final Aggregate Consideration to
      be equal to the product of 0.85 and the Initial Aggregate Consideration,
      and (2) the number equal to a quotient (rounded to the nearest
      one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of which is the Index Ratio multiplied
      by the Share Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator of which is the
      Citizens Ratio, (B) increase the Cash Component by an amount equal to
      product of (1) the Share Ratio as adjusted pursuant to the preceding
      Clause (A) minus the Share Ratio prior to such adjustment, (2) the number
      of shares of issued and outstanding Republic Common Stock on the
      Determination Date and (3) the Average Closing Price, or (C) increase the
      Share Ratio less than would otherwise be required by the preceding Clause
      (A) but increase the Cash Component by the amount required to achieve a
      like economic result. If Citizens makes an election contemplated by the
      preceding sentence within such five-day period, it shall give prompt
      written notice to Republic of such election and the revised Stock
      Consideration or Cash Component, as applicable, whereupon no termination
      shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) and this Agreement
      shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Share
      Ratio or Cash Component, as applicable, shall have been so modified), and
      any references in this Agreement to "Share Ratio" or "Cash Component," as
      applicable, shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Share Ratio or Cash
      Component, as applicable, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 8.1(h).

                  If the outstanding shares of common stock of Citizens or any
      company belonging to the Index Group shall be changed into a different
      number of shares by reason of any stock dividend, reclassification,
      recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
      transaction between the date of the Agreement and the Determination Date,
      the prices for the common stock of such company will be appropriately
      adjusted.

                  For purposes of this Section 8.1(h), the following terms shall
      have the meanings set forth below:

                  "Average Closing Price" of the Citizens Common Stock shall
      mean the arithmetic mean of the daily closing sales prices per share of
      Citizens Common Stock reported on the Nasdaq (as reported by the Wall
      Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source)
      for the five consecutive Nasdaq trading days ending at the close of
      trading on the Determination Date.

                  "Business Day" means Monday through Friday of each week,
      except a legal holiday recognized as such by the U.S. Government or any

                  "Final Aggregate Consideration" means the value of the Merger
      Consideration calculated substituting the Average Closing Price for the
      Citizens Closing Price on the Determination Date.

                  "Final Index Price" means the sum of the Final Prices for each
      company comprising the Index Group multiplied by the weight set forth on
      Exhibit A opposite the name of the applicable company, as they may be
      adjusted in accordance herewith.

                  "Final Price" means, with respect to any company belonging to
      the Index Group, the arithmetic average of the daily closing sales prices
      of a share of common stock of such company, as reported on the
      consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or exchange on
      which such common stock is principally traded (as reported by the Wall
      Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source)
      for the same trading days used in calculating the Average Closing Price.

                  "Index Group" means the sixteen financial institution holding
      companies listed on Exhibit A attached hereto, the common stock of all of
      which shall be publicly traded and as to which there shall not have been a

      to which any such company shall have made a proposal to acquire another
      company in which 20% or more of its outstanding shares would be issued, in
      each case at any time during the period beginning on the date of this
      Agreement and ending on the Determination Date. In the event that, at any
      time during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending
      on the Determination Date, the common stock of any such company ceases to
      be publicly traded, a proposal to acquire any such company is announced,
      or such company announces an acquisition proposal in which 20% or more of
      such company's outstanding shares are to be issued, such company will be
      removed from the Index Group, and the weights (which have been determined
      based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock) attributed to
      the remaining companies will be adjusted proportionately for purposes of
      determining the Final Index Price and the Initial Index Price. The sixteen
      financial institution holding companies and the weights attributed to them
      are listed on Exhibit A.

the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

Agreement by either Republic or Citizens as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Republic,

      the Merger, which shall be borne equally by Republic and Citizens, all
      fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement,
      and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
      party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
      consummated.

                        (i) if Citizens shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
            to Section 8.1(e), then Republic shall pay an amount equal to $36
            million (the "Termination Fee") on the Business Day following such
            termination; or

                        (ii) if (A) Citizens shall terminate this Agreement as a
            result of a failure to consummate the Merger prior to the date set
            forth in Section 8.1(c) caused by a material breach (other than an
            unintentional material breach) of this Agreement by Republic, either
            party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) due
            to the failure to obtain the required Republic shareholder approval
            addressed therein, or Citizens shall terminate this Agreement
            pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (other than as a result of any
            unintentional breach of this Agreement), and (B) a Republic
            Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
            communicated or made known to the senior management or Board of

            communicated or made known a bona fide intention, whether or not
            conditional, to make a Republic Alternative Proposal) after the date
            hereof and before the termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or
            8.1(d) in the case of a termination pursuant to either such Section
            or before the Republic Shareholder Meeting in the case of a
            termination pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then (1) Republic shall pay
            an amount equal to one-third of the Termination Fee on the Business
            Day following such termination and (2) if, within twelve months of
            the date of such termination of this Agreement, Republic or any
            Republic Subsidiary enters into any definitive agreement with
            respect to, or consummates, any Republic Alternative Proposal
            (provided that, in this instance, all percentages included in the
            definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall be increased to 50%),
            then Republic shall pay an amount equal to two-thirds of the
            Termination Fee upon the date of such execution or consummation,
            whichever is earlier.

                  (c) Citizens shall pay to Republic, by wire transfer of

            to Section 8.1(f), then Citizens shall pay an amount equal to the
            Termination Fee on the Business Day following such termination; or

                        (ii) if (A) Republic shall terminate this Agreement as a
            result of a failure to consummate the Merger prior to the date set
            forth in Section 8.1(c) caused by a material breach (other than an
            unintentional material breach) of this Agreement by Citizens, either
            party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) due
            to the failure to obtain the required Citizens shareholder approval
            addressed therein, or Republic shall terminate this Agreement
            pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (other than as a result of any
            unintentional breach of this Agreement), and (B) a Citizens
            Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
            communicated or made known to the senior management or Board of
            Directors of Citizens (or any person shall have publicly announced,
            communicated or made known a bona fide intention, whether or not
            conditional, to make a Citizens Alternative Proposal) after the date
            hereof and before the termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or
            8.1(d) in the case of a termination pursuant to either such Section
            or before the Citizens Shareholder Meeting in the case of a
            termination pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then (1) Citizens shall pay
            an amount equal to one-third of the Termination Fee on the Business
            Day following such termination and (2) if, within twelve months of
            the date of such termination of this Agreement, Citizens or any
            Citizens Subsidiary enters into any definitive agreement with
            respect to, or consummates, any Citizens Alternative Proposal
            (provided that, in this instance, all percentages included in the
            definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall be increased to 50%),
            then Citizens shall pay an amount equal to two-thirds of the
            Termination Fee upon the date of such execution or consummation,
            whichever is earlier.

                  (d) In the event that either party fails to pay when due any
      amount payable under this Section 8.3 and the other party commences a suit
      that results in a judgment against such first party for the Termination
      Fee, then such defaulting party shall reimburse such other party for all
      costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
      counsel) incurred in connection with such suit.

            8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by
the shareholders of Republic and Citizens; provided, however, that after any
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders
of Republic or Citizens, as the case may be, there may not be, without further
approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires
such further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

            8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf
of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

(subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth
in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the
parties (the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that if the Closing would
otherwise occur during the calendar month preceding any fiscal- or year-end,
then Citizens may elect to cause the Closing Date to occur during the first full
week of the first calendar month of such succeeding fiscal quarter or year.

            9.2 Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. None

in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or
in part after the Effective Time.

                           Citizens Bylaw Amendment

            (a) The board of directors of the corporation shall include: (i)

Directors and seven (7) Republic Continuing Directors; (ii) following Citizens's
2008 annual shareholders' meeting and until the 2009 annual shareholders'
meeting, eight (8) Citizens Continuing Directors and six (6) Republic Continuing
Directors; and (iii) following Citizens's 2009 annual shareholders' meeting and
until the 2010 shareholders' meeting, seven (7) Citizens Continuing Directors
and five (5) Republic Continuing Directors. On each of the foregoing dates, the
Citizens Continuing Directors, acting by majority vote, shall select one

Continuing Directors, and all vacancies on the board of directors created by the
cessation of service of a Republic Continuing Director shall be filled by a
nominee proposed to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the
board of directors by a majority of the remaining Republic Continuing Directors.
The terms "Continuing Citizens Directors" and "Continuing Republic Directors"
shall for purposes of this Section 14 mean, respectively, the directors of
Citizens or Republic, as the case may be, as of the Effective Time (as defined

be, prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and any
additional directors of Citizens who take office after the Effective Time who
are nominated, or proposed to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
of the Board of Directors of Citizens, by a majority of the Continuing Citizens
Directors or the Continuing Republic Directors, as the case may be.

            (b) Until Citizens's 2010 annual shareholders' meeting, any
amendment of or change to Section 14(a) of these Bylaws shall require the
affirmative vote of at least 75% of the full board of directors of the

                           Form of Affiliate Letter

Citizens Banking Corporation
328 S. Saginaw Street
Flint, Michigan 48502

Ladies and Gentlemen:

            I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Republic Bancorp Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Republic"), as
the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 26, 2006 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and between Citizens Banking Corporation, a Michigan corporation
("Citizens"), and Republic, Republic shall be merged with and into Citizens (the
"Merger"). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

            I represent, warrant and covenant to Citizens that in the event I
receive any Citizens Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

            I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Citizens
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

            I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Citizens Common Stock to the extent I
believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Republic.

            I have been advised that the issuance of Citizens Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of
Republic I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Republic and the
distribution by me of Citizens Common Stock has not been registered under the
Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Citizens Common Stock
issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition
has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition
is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145
promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to Citizens, such sale, transfer or other disposition is
otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

            I understand that Citizens is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of Citizens Common Stock by me or on my
behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

            I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Citizens's transfer agents with respect to Citizens Common Stock and that there
will be placed on the certificates for Citizens Common Stock issued to me, or
any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

            "The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in
            a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
            of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
            compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a
            registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
            registration."

            I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Citizens
Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule 145, Citizens reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

            "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
            under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
            received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated
            under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
            acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
            connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
            Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
            transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
            registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

            It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall
be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or
the issuance of a letter to Citizens's transfer agent removing such stop
transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply,
if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under
the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing
Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two
years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the
Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective
Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall
have delivered to Citizens (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the
Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Citizens, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Citizens,
to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not
required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory
evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates
are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective
registration under the Securities Act.

            I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to
(i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii)
any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any
similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my
spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities
or of the equity interest.

            It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.

            Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on
my part that I am an "affiliate" of Republic as described in the first paragraph
of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim
that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.


                                    Very truly yours,


                                    By:
