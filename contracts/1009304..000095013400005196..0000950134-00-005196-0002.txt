                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     Section 2.01  Conversion Of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company capital stock or capital stock of Merger Sub:

          (a) Capital Stock Of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
     the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one
     fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per
     share, of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Cancellation Of Treasury Stock And Parent-Owned Stock. All shares
     of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of Company ("Company Common
     Stock") owned by Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common
     Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary (as
     defined in Section 3.01) of Parent shall be cancelled and retired and shall
     cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
     delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of Common Stock, par value
     $.00025 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") owned by Company shall
     be unaffected by the Merger.

          (c) Exchange Ratio For Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.02,
     each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (excluding shares
     to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) but including all shares
     issued pursuant to the 100% stock dividend to be distributed by Company on
     or about March 13, 2000) shall be converted into fifty-five hundredths
     (.55) of a duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
     share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock (the "Merger
     Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
     Common Stock, as so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
     automatically be cancelled
                                       A-7
<PAGE>   8

     and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
     which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
     Company Common Stock (a "Company Certificate") shall cease to have any
     rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive a certificate or
     certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares
     of Parent Common Stock into which such holder's shares of Company Common
     Stock were converted at the Effective Time and any cash payable pursuant to
     Section 2.02(e) in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock and
     distributions deliverable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), without interest,
     upon the surrender of such Company Certificate in accordance with Section
     2.02. In the event Parent or Company changes (or establishes a record date
     for changing) the number or classes of shares of Parent Common Stock or
     Company Common Stock, as the case may be, issued and outstanding prior to
     the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
     recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, reverse stock split,
     combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
     outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock and the record date
     therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be
     proportionately and equitably adjusted to reflect such stock split, stock
     dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, reverse stock
     split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction; provided,
     however, that no adjustment to the Exchange Ratio shall be made in
     connection with the 100% stock dividend to be distributed by Company on or
     about March 13, 2000.

     Section 2.02  Exchange Of Certificates. The procedures for exchanging
Company Certificates are as follows:

          (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
     with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and Company (the
     "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the former holders of shares of
     Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.02,
     through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of
     Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
     distributions with respect thereto deliverable by virtue of Section
     2.02(c), being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable
     pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for Company Certificates and (ii)
     sufficient funds to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
     pursuant to Section 2.02(e).

          (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
     Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
     holder of record of a Company Certificate or Company Certificates whose
     shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into
     the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
     that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
     Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Certificates to
     the Exchange Agent and shall be in such customary form and have such other
     provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
     instructions for effecting the surrender of such Company Certificates in
     exchange for a certificate or certificates representing the Merger
     Consideration (plus cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
     Stock and distributions deliverable as provided in Section 2.02(e)). Upon
     surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
     together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, (1) the holder of
     such Company Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor a certificate
     representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
     such holder's shares of Company Common Stock were converted at the
     Effective Time, certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with
     Section 2.02(c), and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
     Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(e), and (2) the Company Certificate
     so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer
     of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
     transfer records of Company, a certificate representing the proper number
     of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
     Company Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to
     the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
     effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
     taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
     2.02, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
     Effective Time to represent only the ownership of
                                       A-8
<PAGE>   9

     the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of
     Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Certificate
     have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and the right to receive upon
     such surrender the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional
     share of Parent Common Stock and distributions deliverable as contemplated
     by this Section 2.02(e) and the right to receive certificates representing
     whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

          (c) Distributions With Respect To Unsurrendered Certificates. No
     dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
     with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
     Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate
     with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby and
     no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
     holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and all such dividends, other
     distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
     shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the
     Exchange Fund, in each case until the holder of record of such Company
     Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate. Subject to the effect
     of applicable escheat and unclaimed property laws, following surrender of
     any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
     such Company Certificate, without interest, (i) at the time of such
     surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
     Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
     2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
     date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable with respect to
     the whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
     Common Stock previously represented by such Company Certificate were
     converted, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
     dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
     Time but prior to the surrender of such Company Certificate and a payment
     date subsequent to the surrender of such Company Certificate payable with
     respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

          (d) No Further Ownership Rights In Company Common Stock. The shares
     (and the certificates representing shares) of Parent Common Stock issued in
     exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
     hereof (and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.02(e))
     shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
     rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however,
     to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any
     other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which
     may have been declared or made by Company on or with respect to such shares
     of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (to
     the extent permitted under Section 5.01) prior to the date hereof and which
     remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and from and after the Effective Time
     there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
     books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
     which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
     the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving
     Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
     and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.02.

          (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing
     fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
     for exchange of Company Certificates, and such fractional share interests
     will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
     stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
     Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant
     to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
     of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company
     Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock owned by or
     registered in the name of such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
     (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
     Parent Common Stock multiplied by the average of the last reported sales
     prices of Parent Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market,
     on each of the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date of the
     Effective Time.

                                       A-9
<PAGE>   10

          (f) Termination Of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
     which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates for one
     hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
     Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Certificates who have not
     previously complied with this Section 2.02 shall thereafter look only to
     Parent for certificates representing Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu
     of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
     distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

          (g) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
     be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common
     Stock, as the case may be, for any shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
     Common Stock (or cash in lieu of any fractional share or dividends or
     distributions with respect thereto) properly delivered to a public official
     pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

          (h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
     shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
     payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
     Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation is
     required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
     under the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
     tax law. To the extent that amounts are properly so withheld by the
     Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
     shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
     the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
     deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
     as the case may be.

          (i) Lost Company Certificates. If any Company Certificate shall have
     been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
     fact by the person or entity claiming such Company Certificate to be lost,
     stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person
     or entity of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as
     indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
     alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Company Certificate, the
     Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
     Company Certificate a certificate or certificates representing the shares
     of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock
     represented by such Company Certificate were converted pursuant to Section
     2.01, any cash in lieu of any fractional share, and any unpaid dividends or
     other distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
     respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

     Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct except as set
forth herein, in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.04) filed
since January 1, 1999, and in the disclosure schedule delivered by Company to
Parent on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the
numbered sections contained in this Article III and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify other sections in this Article III only to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also
qualifies or applies to such other sections.

     Section 3.01  Organization Of Company. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries
(as defined below) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize the concept of good
standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its property
and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be

respect to jurisdictions which recognize the concept of good standing) as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified
would have a Company Material

Adverse Effect, as defined in Section 9.03(a). Neither Company nor any
Subsidiary of Company directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity, excluding securities in any publicly
traded company held for investment by Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
comprising less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of such company.
Each and every Subsidiary of Company and its place of incorporation or
organization is listed in Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. As
used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" or "Subsidiaries" means, with
respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other Subsidiary
of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general
partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such
party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership) or (ii)
at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other
organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party and/or
by any one or more of its Subsidiaries.

     Section 3.02  Company Capital Structure.

          (a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 100,000,000
     shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of Preferred
     Stock, $.001 par value, ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of March 9, 2000
     (without giving effect to the 100% stock dividend to be distributed by
     Company on or about March 13, 2000), (i) 30,599,129 shares of Company
     Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued,
     fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock
     were held in the treasury of Company or by its Subsidiaries. The Company
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth the number of shares of Company Common Stock
     reserved for future issuance pursuant to stock options granted and
     outstanding as of March 9, 2000 (without giving effect to the 100% stock
     dividend to be distributed by Company on or about March 13, 2000) and the
     plans under which such options were granted (collectively, the "Company
     Stock Plans"). No material change in such capitalization has occurred
     between March 9, 2000 and the date of this Agreement, except as a result of
     the exercise of stock options. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
     the shares of Company Preferred Stock is issued and outstanding. All shares
     of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as specified above are duly
     authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
     instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be validly issued,
     fully paid and nonassessable. There are no obligations, contingent or
     otherwise, of Company or its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
     otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the capital stock
     of any Subsidiary or to loan funds to or make any material investment (in
     the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any Subsidiary or
     any other entity other than (i) guarantees of bank obligations of its
     Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business, and (ii)
     repurchase rights of Company under the Company Stock Plans, or under any
     stock option agreements pursuant to which options were granted under such
     plans. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Company's
     Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable and all such shares (other than directors' qualifying shares
     in the case of foreign Subsidiaries) are owned by Company or another
     Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
     pledges, agreements, limitations on Company's voting rights, charges or
     other encumbrances of any nature other than security interests, liens,
     claims, pledges, agreements, limitations, charges or other encumbrances
     that (A) relate to any taxes or other governmental charges or levies that
     are not yet due and payable, (B) relate to, were created, arose or exist in
     connection with any legal proceeding that is being contested in good faith,
     or (C) individually or in the aggregate would not materially interfere with
     the ability of Company and each of its Subsidiaries to conduct their
     business as currently conducted.

          (b) Except as set forth in this Section 3.02 or as reserved for future
     grants of options under the Company Stock Plans, as of March 9, 2000, (i)
     there were no equity securities of any class of Company or its
     Subsidiaries, or securities exchangeable into or exercisable for such
     equity securities,

                                      A-11
<PAGE>   12

     issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and (ii) there were no
     options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments or
     agreements of any character to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries was
     a party or by which it was bound obligating Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
     sold, additional shares of capital stock of Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries or obligating Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
     extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into any such option, warrant,
     equity security, call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no voting
     trusts, proxies or other voting agreements or understandings with respect
     to the shares of capital stock of Company to which Company is a party. The
     terms of the Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the
     outstanding options thereunder will permit the assumption of such options
     by Parent in the manner contemplated in Section 6.09, without the approval
     or consent of the holders of such options, the Company stockholders or any
     other party.

          (c) The current "Offering Periods" (as defined under the Company 1996
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP")) in effect as of the date
     of this Agreement began on August 16, 1998, February 16, 1999, August 16,
     1999 and February 16, 2000, and will end on August 15, 2000, February 15,
     2001, August 15, 2001 and February 15, 2002, respectively. Except for the
     purchase rights granted under the Company ESPP on August 16, 1998, February
     16, 1999, August 16, 1999, and February 16, 2000 to the current
     participants in the Offering Periods that commenced on those dates, there
     are no other purchase rights or options outstanding as of the date of this
     Agreement under the Company ESPP.

     Section 3.03  Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings And Consents.

          (a) Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
     into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

     breach of, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
     Company, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
     without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a
     right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
     loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under,
     any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
     indenture, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation to
     which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
     or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict with
     or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order,
     decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets.

          (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
     declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission
     or other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental Entity")

          (a) Company has filed and made available to Parent all forms, reports
     and documents required to be filed by Company with the SEC (collectively,
     the "Company SEC Reports"). The Company SEC Reports (i) at the time filed,
     complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
     Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Exchange
     Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or
     if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
     then as of and on the date so amended or superseded) contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
     be stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the
     statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances
     under which they were made, not misleading. Company's Subsidiaries are not
     required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

          (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
     case, any related notes) contained in the Company SEC Reports complied as
     to form in all material respects with the applicable published rules and
     regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The consolidated financial
     statements contained in the Company SEC Reports and the Company Balance
     Sheet (as defined below) were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
     throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to
     such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
     permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly presented the consolidated
     financial position of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and the
     consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Company and its
     Subsidiaries for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
     financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end
     adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material in amount.

     Parent.

     Section 3.05  No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for liabilities referred
to in the Company Balance Sheet and normal or recurring liabilities incurred
since December 31, 1999 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

accrued, contingent or otherwise) required to be reflected or disclosed in
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, which individually or in
the aggregate has had or will, solely with the passage of time, imminently
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 3.06  Absence Of Certain Changes Or Events. Since the date of the
Company Balance Sheet, Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and, since such date, there has not been (a) any Company Material
Adverse Effect or any event which, individually or in the aggregate, will,
solely with the passage of time, imminently result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect; (b) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by
insurance) with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries having a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (c) any material change by Company in its accounting
methods, principles or practices to which Parent has not previously consented in
writing; (d) any revaluation by Company of any of its assets; or (e) any other
action or event that occurred between the date of the Company Balance Sheet and
the date of this Agreement that would have required the consent of Parent
pursuant to Section 5.01 had such action or event occurred after the date of
this Agreement and that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or will,
solely with the passage of time, imminently result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

     account extensions), (ii) paid or accrued all Taxes due and payable for
     Taxable periods (or portions thereof) through the date of the Company
     Balance Sheet and (iii) no Tax liabilities accruing after the date of the
     Company Balance Sheet other than liabilities arising from the ordinary
     course of business. Neither the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") nor
     any other Taxing Authority has asserted any claim for taxes, or to the
     knowledge of Company and its Subsidiaries, is threatening to assert any
     claims for Taxes. Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld or
     collected and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authorities (or are properly
     holding for such payment) all Taxes required by law to be withheld or
     collected. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made an election
     under Section 341(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. There are no liens for
     Taxes upon the assets of Company or its Subsidiaries (other than liens for
     Taxes that are not yet due). Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
     a party to any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement with an unaffiliated
     party, nor does Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any liability or
     potential liability to another party under any such agreement. Neither
     Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of a
     consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Company was not the
     ultimate parent corporation.

          (c) There is no agreement, contract or arrangement to which Company is
     a party that would reasonably be expected, individually or collectively, as
     a result of the Merger, this Agreement and subsequent events, to result in
     the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of Section
     280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Section 3.08  Properties. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns
any real property. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in

party ("Material Lease"). Copies of all Material Leases have been made available
by Company to Parent.

     Section 3.09  Intellectual Property.

     possess legally enforceable rights to use, all patents, trademarks, trade
     names, service marks, copyrights, Internet domain names and mask works, any
     applications for and registrations of such patents, trademarks, trade
     names, service marks, copyrights and mask works, and all processes,
     formulae, methods, schematics, technology, know how, computer software
     programs or applications and tangible or intangible proprietary information
     or material that are necessary to conduct the business of Company and its
     Subsidiaries as currently conducted by Company and its Subsidiaries (the
     "Company Intellectual Property Rights").

     performance of Company's obligations under this Agreement, in breach of (i)
     any material license, sublicense or other agreement relating to the Company
     Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) any material license, sublicense or
     other agreement pursuant to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
     authorized to use any third party patents, trademarks or copyrights,
     including software, which are incorporated in or form a part of any product
     of Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the business of
     Company and its Subsidiaries, taking Company and its Subsidiaries together
     as a whole.

          (c) (i) All patents, copyrights, registered trademarks and registered
     service marks which are held by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
     which are material to the business of Company and its Subsidiaries, taking
     Company and its Subsidiaries together as a whole, are valid and subsisting;
     (ii) since January 1, 1997 Company has not been sued in any suit, action or
     proceeding which involves a claim of infringement of any patents,
     trademarks, service marks, copyrights or violation of any trade secret or
     other proprietary right of any third party; and (iii) the manufacturing,
     marketing, licensing or sale of Company's products does not infringe any
     patent, trademark, service mark or copyright, trade secret or other
     proprietary right of any third party.

          (d) Company has taken all actions necessary and appropriate to assure
     that there shall be no material adverse change in the delivery of Company's
     products and services by reason of the advent of the year 2000, and
     warrants that all of its products (including products currently under
     development) will, without interruption or manual intervention, continue to
     consistently, predictably and accurately record, store, process, calculate
     and present calendar dates falling on and after (and if applicable, spans
     of time including) January 1, 2000, and will consistently, predictably and
     accurately calculate any information dependent on or relating to such dates
     in the same manner, and with the same functionality, data integrity and
     performance, as such products record, store, process, calculate and present
     calendar dates on or before December 31, 1999, or calculate any information
     dependent on or relating to such dates.

          (e) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
     agreement ("Third Party Agreement") in which another party to such Third
     Party Agreement has, or will have, as a result of the execution and
     delivery of this Agreement by Company or the performance of Company's
     obligations under this Agreement, the right to terminate such Third Party
     Agreement or the right to obtain the Company's source code under such Third
     Party Agreement.

     Section 3.10  Agreements, Contracts And Commitments. Neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of, or has since January 1, 1997 received
in writing any claim or notice that it has breached, in any material respect,
any material term or condition of any material agreement, contract or commitment
to which it is a party or by which any of its assets and properties are bound
("Company Material Contracts"). Each Company Material Contract that has not
expired by its terms or otherwise been terminated is in full force and effect
and is not subject to any material default thereunder of which Company is aware
by any party obligated to Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to such
Company Material Contract.

     Section 3.11  Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation against Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending

notice of assertion, which, individually or in the aggregate seeks a material
amount of damages or other relief material to the business or assets of Company
and its Subsidiaries (taking Company and its Subsidiaries together as a whole)
or which could reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability
of Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
knowledge of Company and its Subsidiaries, there is no claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation described in Section 6.11 pending as of the date of
this Agreement. No officer or director has provided notice to Company of the
existence of any claim with respect to any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.

in the Parent SEC Reports (as defined in Section 4.04) filed since January 1,
1999, and in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to Company on the date
of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"). The Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered sections
contained in this Article IV and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify

and operate its property and to carry on its business as now being conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize the concept of good
standing) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure to
be so qualified would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as defined in
Section 9.03(b). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any

     and documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC (collectively,
     the "Parent SEC Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports (i) at the time filed,
     complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
     Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not
     at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior
     to the date of this Agreement, then as of and on the date so amended or
     superseded) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
     state a material fact required to be stated in such Parent SEC Reports or
     necessary in order to make the statements in such Parent SEC Reports, in
     the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     Parent's Subsidiaries are not required to file any forms, reports or other
     documents with the SEC.

     case, any related notes) contained in the Parent SEC Reports complied as to
     form in all material respects with the applicable published rules and
     regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The consolidated financial
     statements contained in the Parent SEC Reports and the Parent Balance Sheet
     (as defined below) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
     consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
     indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
     unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly
     presented the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
     Subsidiaries as of the dates and the consolidated results of operations and
     cash flows of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated, except

     normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not
     expected to be material in amount. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet
     of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 (the "Parent Balance
     Sheet") has been delivered to Company.

to in the Parent Balance Sheet and normal or recurring liabilities incurred
since December 31, 1999 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, Parent and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities (either
accrued, contingent or otherwise (required to be reflected or disclosed in

of time, imminently result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 4.06  Absence Of Certain Changes Or Events. Since the date of the
Parent Balance Sheet, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and, since such date, there has not been (i) any Parent Material
Adverse Effect or any event that will, solely with the passage of time,
imminently result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any damage,

or any of its Subsidiaries having a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iii) any
material change by Parent in its accounting methods, principles or practices to
which Company has not previously consented in writing; (iv) any revaluation by
Parent of any of its assets; or (v) any other action or event that occurred

would have required the consent of Company pursuant to Section 5.02 had such
action or event occurred after the date of this Agreement and that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or will, solely with the passage of time,
imminently result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 4.07  Taxes. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have (i) properly
completed and timely filed all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns and
reports required to be filed by them prior to the date of this Agreement (taking

Taxable periods (or portions thereof) through the date of the Parent Balance
Sheet, and (iii) no Tax liabilities accruing after the date of the Parent
Balance Sheet other than liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business.
Neither the IRS nor any other Tax Authority has asserted any claim for Taxes, or
to the knowledge of Parent and its Subsidiaries, is threatening to assert any
claims for Taxes. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld or collected
and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authorities (or are properly holding for
such payment) all Taxes required by law to be withheld or collected. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than liens for Taxes that are not yet

of its Subsidiaries have any liability or potential liability to another party
under any such agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever
been a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Parent was
not the ultimate parent corporation.

     Section 4.08  Agreements, Contracts And Commitments. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has breached, or received in writing any claim or notice
that it has breached, in any material respect, any material term or condition of
any material agreement, contract or commitment to which it is a party or by
which any of its assets or properties are bound ("Parent Material Contracts").
Each Parent Material Contract that has not expired by its terms is in full force
and effect and is not subject to any material default thereunder of which Parent
is aware by any party obligated to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
such Parent Material Contract.

     Section 4.09  Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pending
or as to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice
of assertion, which, individually or in the aggregate, seeks a material amount
of damages or other relief material to the business or assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or which could reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 4.10  Environmental Matters. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws. The
properties currently owned or operated by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or other structures) are not

                                      A-22
<PAGE>   23

contaminated with any Hazardous Substances. The properties formerly owned or
operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries were not contaminated with
Hazardous Substances during the period of ownership or operation by Parent or
its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
material liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any
third party property. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has caused or
contributed to any release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance in
violation of any Environmental Law. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received in writing from any Governmental Entity any notice, demand, letter,
claim or request for information alleging that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
may be in violation of or liable under any Environmental Law. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any orders, decrees, injunctions or other
arrangements with any Governmental Entity (other than those of general
applicability), or is subject to any indemnity or other agreement with any third
party, relating in either case to liability under any Environmental Law for
release of Hazardous Substances. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no
circumstances or conditions involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that
will, solely with the passage of time, imminently result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect pursuant to any Environmental Law.

     Section 4.11  Employee Benefit Plans. With respect to the Parent Employee
Plans (as defined in Section 6.12(d)), individually and in the aggregate, Parent
is not subject to any material unsatisfied liability for (i) violation of ERISA,
the Internal Revenue Code or any other applicable law, (ii) for an excise or
other penalty tax or penalty under any such law, or (iii) under Title IV of
ERISA and, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred and there exists no
set of circumstances which could reasonably be expected to result in any such
liability. With respect to the Parent Employee Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations for which contributions have
not been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit obligations
which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted
in accordance with GAAP, on the financial statements of Parent.

     Section 4.12  Compliance With Laws. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is
in substantial compliance with, is not in violation in any material respect of
and has not received any written notice of violation with respect to, any
federal, state or local statute, law or regulation with respect to the conduct
of its business, or the ownership or operation of its business which by its
terms could reasonably be expected to subject Parent and its Subsidiaries to
material financial or other penalties or criminal liability.

     Section 4.13  Tax Matters. To the knowledge of Parent after good faith
consultation with its independent accountants, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action which would prevent the Merger
from constituting a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Section 4.14  Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Registration Statement shall
not contain, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated in the Registration Statement or necessary in order to
make the statements in the Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances
under with they were made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent
for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to the
stockholders of Company in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting and
to the stockholders of Parent in connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting
shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to
stockholders of Parent and Company, at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, or at the time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting (if one is held)
contain any statement which, at such time and in light of the circumstances
under which it was made, is false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus not false or misleading
or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement made by
Parent in any earlier communication by Parent with respect to the solicitation

business partnership or alliance that would otherwise be prohibited by this
Section 5.01, and describing the material terms of such proposed transaction,
partnership, or alliance, Parent shall respond to such request within ten (10)
days after such request is deemed given pursuant to Section 9.02. If Parent does
not object in writing to such request within ten (10) days after such request is
deemed given pursuant to Section 9.02, Parent shall be deemed to have consented
to such request, on the terms substantially as described in such request.

     Section 5.02  Covenants Of Parent. During the period from the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
or the Effective Time, Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, except
to the extent that Company shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and except as required by this
Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.02 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, to
carry on its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially
the same manner as previously conducted (it being acknowledged that the
foregoing shall not limit the ability of Parent to make or pursue corporate
acquisitions that will not violate any of the restrictions set forth in clause
(d) of this Section 5.02 or in clause (e) of this Section 5.02 as it relates to
clause (d) of this Section 5.02), to pay its debts and taxes when due subject to
good faith disputes over such debts or taxes, to pay or perform its other
obligations when due subject to good faith disputes over such obligations, and,
to the extent consistent with such business, use all reasonable efforts
consistent with past practices and policies to preserve substantially intact its
present business organization, keep available the services of its present
officers and key employees and preserve its relationships with customers,
suppliers, distributors, and others having business dealings with it and except
in each case where the failure to do so would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Except as required by this Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.02 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall not (and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to), without the written consent of Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed):

          (a) declare or pay any dividends on or make any other distributions
     (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of any of its capital
     stock, or split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or
     authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or
     in substitution for shares of its capital stock, or purchase or otherwise
     acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of its capital stock except
     from former employees, directors and consultants in accordance with
     agreements providing for the repurchase of shares in connection with any
     termination of service to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries;

          (b) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of a material property
     or asset or a material amount of properties or assets, except for
     transactions in the ordinary course of business;

          (c) transfer or license to any person or entity or otherwise extend,
     amend or modify in any material respect any rights to the Parent
     Intellectual Property Rights other than on a non-exclusive basis in the
     ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

<PAGE>   28

          (d) engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any
     action to be taken or transaction to be entered into that could reasonably
     be expected to delay the consummation of, or otherwise adversely affect,
     any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

          (e) agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions described
     in Section 5.02(a) through Section 5.02(d).

     Section 5.03  Cooperation. Subject to compliance with applicable law, from
the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of Parent and Company shall
confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more Representatives (as
defined in Section 6.02(a)) of the other party to report on the general status
of ongoing operations and shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel
with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Company Voting Agreements, the
Parent Voting Agreements, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

     Section 5.04  Advice Of Changes. Each of Company and Parent shall promptly
advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent it has knowledge of
(i) any representation or warranty made by it (or, in the case of Parent, made
by it or Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or incorrect in
any respect where the failure of such representation or warranty to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely
imminently to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be, (ii) the failure by it (or, in the case of
Parent, by it or Merger Sub) to comply in any material respect with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it (or in the case of Parent, by it or Merger Sub) under this
Agreement, and (iii) any change or event relating to it having, or which is
reasonably likely imminently to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (in the
case of Company) or a Parent Material Adverse Effect (in the case of Parent or
Merger Sub) or which will likely render it impossible for one or more of the
conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied; provided, however, that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Section 6.01  Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement.

          (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
     Agreement, Company and Parent will prepare, and file with the SEC, the
     Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent will prepare and file with the
     SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement/
     Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and Company
     shall provide promptly to the other such information concerning its
     business and financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable
     judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
     appropriate for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
     Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to
     cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and
     auditors in the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
     Registration Statement. Each of Company and Parent will respond to any
     comments of the SEC, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
     have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
     as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company and Parent will
     cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective
     stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the Registration
     Statement is declared effective by the SEC. As promptly as practicable
     after the date of this Agreement, each of Company and Parent will prepare
     and file any other filings required to be filed by it under the Exchange
     Act, the Securities Act or any other federal, foreign or Blue Sky or
     related securities laws or NASD or National Market System rules,
     regulations or bylaws in order to consummate the Merger and the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Company and Parent
     will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any
                                      A-28
<PAGE>   29

     comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its
     staff for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
     Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and will supply the other with copies of
     all correspondence between such party or any of its Representatives, on the
     one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
     Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Merger.
     Each of Company and Parent will cause all documents that it is responsible
     for filing with the SEC under this Section 6.01 to comply in all material
     respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and
     regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of
     this Agreement, nothing herein shall require Parent to qualify to do
     business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file
     a general consent to service of process under any applicable state
     securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
     the Merger.

          (b) If eligible, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i)
     to obtain an exemption from compliance with applicable Nasdaq Stock Market
     stockholder voting requirements promulgated by the NASD in connection with
     the Merger, or (ii) otherwise to make arrangements such that Parent need
     not solicit the vote or hold a meeting of its stockholders in connection
     with the Merger or the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
     thereto. If Parent obtains such an exemption or otherwise makes such
     arrangements, all references to "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus" in this
     Agreement shall be deemed to be changed to "Proxy Statement/Prospectus" and
     all other appropriate changes shall be deemed to be made to this Agreement
     to reflect the fact that a meeting of Parent's stockholders is not
     required.

     Section 6.02  No Solicitation By Company.

          (a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time or a valid termination of
     this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, Company will not, and will not
     authorize, direct or knowingly permit any of its officers, directors,
     employees, affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
     agents, advisors or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to,
     directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
     induce the making, submission or announcement of any Company Takeover
     Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate in any discussions or
     negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any
     information with respect to, or take any other action that would reasonably
     be expected to facilitate any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or would
     reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iii)
     authorize, approve or recommend any Company Takeover Proposal, or (iv)
     enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
     agreement or commitment accepting or providing for any Company Takeover
     Proposal; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.02 or elsewhere
     in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
     Section 9.01) shall prohibit Company's Board of Directors from complying
     with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender
     or exchange offer not made in violation of this Section 6.02; and provided,
     further, that nothing in this Section 6.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
     or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit Company, before the
     adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Company, from furnishing
     information regarding Company or entering into negotiations or discussions
     with, any person in response to a Company Takeover Proposal made, submitted
     or announced by such person (and not withdrawn) or, subject to the
     provisions of Section 6.05, endorsing and/or recommending, or,
     simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
     8.01(h), entering into an agreement accepting or providing for, a Company
     Superior Offer (as defined in Section 6.05(b)), and any such actions
     enumerated in this proviso shall not be considered a breach of this
     Agreement if and to the extent that each of the following conditions is
     satisfied: (1) such Company Takeover Proposal is not attributable to a
     material breach by Company of this Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.05; (2) the
     Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after consultation
     with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
     inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of
     Company to Company stockholders under applicable law; (3) prior to
     furnishing any such information to, or entering into discussions or
     negotiations with, such person, Company gives Parent written notice of the
     identity of such person, the terms and conditions of such Company Takeover
     Proposal and Company's
                                      A-29
<PAGE>   30

     intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
     negotiations with, such person; (4) Company receives from such person an
     executed confidentiality agreement which shall not in any way restrict
     Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under this Agreement
     and which shall contain customary limitations on the use and disclosure of
     all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such person by or
     on behalf of Company and other terms no less favorable to Company than
     those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (5) contemporaneously
     with furnishing any such information to such person, Company furnishes such
     information to Parent (to the extent that such information has not been
     previously furnished by Company to Parent).

          (b) Company and its Representatives shall immediately cease and cause
     to be terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, exchanges
     of information and other activities with respect to any Company Takeover
     Proposal pending as of the date of this Agreement. Promptly following the
     execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company shall (i) inform each of
     its directors and officers and financial, legal, accounting and other
     advisors retained or involved in the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.02 and in the
     Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) request each person that has heretofore
     executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with
     its consideration of acquiring Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return
     to Company or otherwise dispose of all confidential information furnished
     to such person by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries during
     the one-year period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with
     such person's consideration of acquiring or engaging in a merger or other
     business combination transaction with Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
     Company shall immediately notify Parent if any proposals or offers
     constituting a Company Takeover Proposal are received by, any non-public
     information in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal is requested
     from, or any discussions or negotiations with respect to a Company Takeover
     Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, Company's officers
     or directors or other individuals involved on behalf of Company in the
     negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or, to the
     knowledge of the foregoing persons, any of Company's other Representatives,
     indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of the person making
     the inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any
     such proposals or offers. Thereafter (i) Company shall provide Parent with
     a true and complete copy of such Company Takeover Proposal or communication
     (if it is in writing) and (ii) Company shall otherwise keep Parent
     informed, on a current basis, with respect to the status and terms of any
     such proposal or offer and the status of any such negotiations or
     discussions.

          (c) Company and Parent agree that irreparable damage would occur in
     the event that the provisions of this Section 6.02 are not performed in
     accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
     accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to
     seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Section 6.02
     and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
     the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition
     to any other remedy to which the parties may be entitled at law or in
     equity.

          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal" means
     any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent or an
     affiliate of Parent) for (i) a merger or other business combination
     involving Company after which the stockholders of Company immediately prior
     to such merger or business combination would own less than eighty percent
     (80%) of the voting securities of the surviving company in such merger or
     business combination and would own less than eighty percent (80%) of the
     voting securities of the parent of the surviving company in such merger or
     business combination, or (ii) the acquisition by a person or "group" as
     defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (other than an acquisition
     by Parent or an affiliate of Parent) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
     outstanding shares of capital stock of Company, or (iii) the acquisition
     (other than an acquisition by Parent or an affiliate of Parent) of all or
     substantially all of the assets of Company.

     Section 6.03  Nasdaq Quotation. Each of Company and Parent agrees to use
all requisite commercially reasonable efforts to continue the quotation of
Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock, respectively, on the Nasdaq
National Market, during the term of this Agreement so that appraisal rights will
not be available to stockholders of Company under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Parent shall use all requisite commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such approval is then required under
applicable law, SEC regulations and Nasdaq National Market rules.

     Section 6.04  Access To Information. From and after the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable
notice and subject to (a) contractual confidentiality obligations and the
requirements of applicable antitrust and other laws, rules and regulations, and
(b) other reasonable restrictions to minimize interference with or disruption of
the other's business and operations, Company and Parent shall each (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of the other, access,
during normal business hours, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, including all Tax Returns and all work papers and other
documentation relating to Taxes, and, during such period, each of Company and
Parent shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the other (x) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant
to the requirements of federal securities laws and (y) all other existing
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law, the parties will
hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

     Section 6.05  Stockholders Meetings.

          (a) Subject in each case to applicable laws, rules and regulations:
     (i) Company will take all action reasonably necessary in accordance with
     the DGCL and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and applicable
     Nasdaq Stock Market rules to cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be
     held for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement, and to
     cause a vote of the Company's stockholders on the adoption of this
     Agreement to be taken, in each case as promptly as practicable after the
     date hereof, and (ii) subject further to the provisions of Section 6.01(b),
     Parent will take all action reasonably necessary in accordance with the
     DGCL and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and applicable Nasdaq
     Stock Market rules to cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be held for
     the purpose of voting upon the Parent Voting Proposal, and to cause a vote
     of Parent's stockholders on the Parent Voting Proposal to be taken, in each
     case as promptly as practicable after the date hereof. Unless otherwise
     mutually agreed by Parent and Company, Parent and Company shall coordinate
     and cooperate with respect to the timing of such meetings and shall use
     their commercially reasonable efforts to hold such meetings at the same
     time and on the same day and as promptly as practicable after the date
     hereof. Parent and, subject to Company's rights under Section 8.01(h),
     Company shall solicit from their respective stockholders proxies in favor
     of the adoption of this Agreement (in the case of Company stockholders) and
     approval of the Parent Voting Proposal (in the case of Parent
     stockholders), and will take all other action necessary or advisable to
     secure the vote or consent of their respective stockholders required under
     NASD rules and the DGCL, as applicable; provided, however, that neither
     Company nor Parent shall be required to take any action that its respective
     Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside
     legal counsel would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to its
     stockholders under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     contained in this Agreement, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
     Stockholders Meeting, and Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent
     Stockholders Meeting, to the extent that (x) such adjournment or
     postponement is necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
     amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is

                                      A-31
<PAGE>   32

     provided to such party's stockholders in advance of the applicable vote or
     (y) additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of
     the approvals required by Section 7.01(a) or (z) as of the time for which
     such stockholders meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
     Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares represented
     (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
     the business of such stockholders meeting. Company shall ensure that the
     Company Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
     conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Company in connection with the
     Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited, and Parent shall ensure that
     Parent Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
     conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Parent in connection with the
     Parent Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the DGCL,
     applicable charter documents, Nasdaq Stock Market rules and all other
     applicable legal requirements.

          (b) (i) The Board of Directors of Company has recommended that
     Company's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at
     the Company Stockholders Meeting; (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
     shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of
     Company has recommended that Company stockholders vote in favor of the
     adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (iii)
     neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall
     withdraw, amend or modify, or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a
     manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
     Company that Company stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this
     Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement or in the
     Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Company
     from omitting such recommendation from the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
     or from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying such recommendation
     if: (A) a Company Superior Offer is made and is not withdrawn, (B) such
     Company Superior Offer is not attributable to a breach by Company in any
     material respect of any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.02, (C)
     forty-eight (48) hours elapse following delivery by Company to Parent of
     written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of Company
     intends to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation, and (D)
     the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after
     consultation with its outside legal counsel, that inclusion of such
     recommendation, or the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify such
     recommendation, would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
     Board of Directors of Company to Company stockholders under applicable law.
     For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Superior Offer" shall mean a bona
     fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
     transactions: (x) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
     recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
     Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately preceding
     such transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the equity interest
     in the surviving, resulting or acquiring entity of such transaction; (y) a
     sale or other disposition by Company of assets (excluding inventory and
     used equipment sold in the ordinary course of business) representing a
     majority of Company's assets; or (z) the acquisition by any person or group
     (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by
     Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to
     acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing fifty percent (50%) or
     more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of
     Company, in each case on terms that, in the good faith judgment of the
     Board of Directors of Company (after consultation with an investment bank
     of nationally recognized reputation) are more favorable (in a manner that,
     in the totality of such terms, is not immaterial) to Company stockholders
     than the Merger (after taking into account all relevant factors, including
     any conditions to the Company Superior Offer, the timing of the
     consummation of the transaction pursuant to the Company Superior Offer, the
     risk of nonconsummation thereof and the need for any required governmental
     or other consents, filings and approvals); provided, however, that an offer
     shall only be a Company Superior Offer if any financing required to
     consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is committed or is
     otherwise reasonably likely, in the good faith judgment of Company's Board
     of Directors, to be obtained on a timely basis.

          (c) (i) The Board of Directors of Parent has recommended that Parent
     stockholders vote in favor of the Parent Voting Proposal at the Parent
     Stockholders Meeting; (ii) the Joint Proxy
                                      A-32
<PAGE>   33

     Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the Board
     of Directors of Parent has recommended that Parent stockholders vote in
     favor of the Parent Voting Proposal at the Parent Stockholders Meeting; and
     (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof
     shall withdraw, amend or modify, or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify,
     in a manner adverse to Company, the recommendation of the Board of
     Directors of Parent that Parent stockholders vote in favor of the Parent
     Voting Proposal. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will vote
     its shares of Merger Sub voting stock in favor of adoption of this
     Agreement.

          (d) Subject to the right of Company to terminate this Agreement
     pursuant to Section 8.01(h), nothing contained in Section 6.05 shall limit
     Company's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
     Stockholders Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board
     of Directors of Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified and
     regardless of whether any Company Takeover Proposal has been commenced,
     disclosed, or announced). Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the
     Confidentiality Agreement shall operate to preclude Company or any officer
     or director of Company from complying with all disclosure obligations it or
     he may have under any applicable federal or state law.

     Section 6.06  Legal Conditions To Merger.

          (a) Company and Parent shall each use all requisite commercially
     reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
     action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and proper under
     applicable law to consummate and make effective the transactions
     contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any
     Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses,
     permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be
     obtained by Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
     with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby including the Merger,
     and (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and
     thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
     Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and the
     Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws,
     (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C)
     any other applicable law. Company and Parent shall cooperate with each
     other in connection with the making of all such filings, including
     providing copies of all such filings to the non-filing party and its
     advisors prior to filing and, if requested, shall accept all reasonable
     additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. Company
     and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each
     other all information required for any application or other filing to be
     made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable law (including
     all information required to be included in the Joint Proxy
     Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement) in connection with the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b) Parent and Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective
     Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable
     efforts to obtain any government clearances required for the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement (including through compliance with the HSR
     Act and any applicable foreign governmental reporting requirements), to
     respond to any government requests for information, and to contest and
     resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
     action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
     judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
     permanent) (an "Order") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
     consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
     administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action.
     The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and
     consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
     analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
     opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party
     hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or
     any other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law. Subject to
     the requirements of applicable law, Parent shall be entitled to direct any
     proceedings or negotiations

                                      A-33
<PAGE>   34

     with any Governmental Entity relating to any such analyses, appearances,
     presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals,
     provided that Parent shall afford Company a reasonable opportunity to
     participate therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
     Section 6.06, neither Parent nor Company nor any of their respective
     Subsidiaries shall be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold
     separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), any assets or
     categories of assets, or businesses of Parent, Company or any of their
     affiliates, or to withdraw from doing business in a particular jurisdiction
     or to take any other action that would, in any case, reasonably be expected
     to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse
     Effect.

          (c) Each of Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their
     respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
     cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts
     to obtain any third party consents related to or required in connection
     with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions
     contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the
     Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case
     may be, or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
     Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring.

     Section 6.07  Public Disclosure. Parent and Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by law.

     Section 6.08  Tax-Free Reorganization. At or prior to the filing of the
Registration Statement, Company and Parent shall execute and deliver to Cooley
Godward LLP and Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP tax representation letters in
customary form. To the extent requested by Parent or Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and Company shall each confirm to Cooley Godward LLP and to Brobeck, Phleger &
Harrison LLP the accuracy and completeness as of the Effective Time of the tax
representation letters delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
Parent and Company shall each use all requisite commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Merger to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Following delivery of the tax
representation letters pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.08, each
of Parent and Company shall use all requisite commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP and Cooley Godward LLP, respectively, to
deliver to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act. In rendering such opinions,
each of such counsel shall be entitled to rely on the tax representation letters
referred to in this Section 6.08.

     Section 6.09  Stock Plans.

          (a) Company has provided Parent with a true and complete list as of
     March 9, 2000 of all holders of outstanding options under the Company Stock
     Plans, including the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
     each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price and
     term of each such option (in each case, without giving effect to the 100%
     stock dividend being distributed by Company on or about March 13, 2000. On
     the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an updated list current
     as of such Closing Date. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
     purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") under
     the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and
     shall constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
     were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the same number of shares
     of Parent Common Stock as the holder of such Company Stock Option would
     have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder
     exercised such option (including any unvested portion thereof) in full
     (disregarding any limitation on exercisability thereof) immediately prior
     to the Effective Time (rounded downward to the nearest whole number), at a
     price per share (rounded upward to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the
     aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock purchasable
     pursuant to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
     Time divided by (z) the number of full shares of Parent
                                      A-34
<PAGE>   35

     Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option in
     accordance with the foregoing. All outstanding rights of Company that it
     may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested
     shares of Company Common Stock issued or issuable under any of the Company
     Stock Plans (the "Repurchase Options") shall be assigned to Parent and
     shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and
     conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
     the shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options and the purchase
     price per shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in the Company Stock Plans, the
     documents governing the outstanding Company Stock Options under the Company
     Stock Plans, and offer letters and other agreements affecting such Company
     Stock Options, the Merger shall not result in the termination or
     acceleration of any outstanding Company Stock Options under the Company
     Stock Plans that are so assumed by Parent. It is the intention of the
     parties that the Company Stock Options so assumed by Parent qualify
     following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
     Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent such Company Stock
     Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time.
     As promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty (30)
     business days after receipt of all option documentation it requires
     relating to the outstanding Company Stock Options, Parent will issue to
     each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is a holder of an
     outstanding Company Stock Option under the Company Stock Plans that is to
     be assumed by Parent hereunder, a document evidencing the foregoing
     assumption of such Company Stock Option by Parent.

          (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
     issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
     under Company Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 6.09.
     As promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within fifteen (15)
     business days after receipt of all option documentation it requires
     relating to the outstanding Company Stock Options, Parent shall file a
     registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) covering shares
     of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to such Company Stock Options
     assumed by Parent provided that such Company Stock Options qualify for
     registration on such Form S-8 (or any such successor form). Company shall
     cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration
     statements.

          (d) The Board of Directors of Company shall, prior to or as of the
     Effective Time, take all necessary actions, pursuant to and in accordance
     with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and the instruments evidencing
     the Company Stock Options, to provide for the conversion of the Company
     Stock Options into options to acquire Parent Common Stock in accordance
     with this Section 6.09, and to provide that no consent of the holders of
     the Company Stock Options is required in connection with such conversion.

          (e) Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16
     Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors
     of Parent, or a committee of two or more "non-employee directors" (as such
     term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) thereof,
     shall adopt resolutions prior to the Effective Time providing that, and
     shall take other appropriate action such that, the deemed grant to Company
     Insiders (as defined below) of options to purchase Parent Common Stock
     under the Company Stock Options (as converted into options to acquire
     Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6.09), and the receipt by
     Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Common
     Stock pursuant to the Merger, are intended to be exempt from liability
     pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Such resolutions shall
     comply with the approval conditions of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act
     for purposes of such Section 16(b) exemption, including specifying the name
     of each Company Insider, the number of equity securities to be acquired or
     disposed of by each Company Insider, the material terms of any derivative
     securities, and that the approval is intended to make the receipt of such
     securities exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act.
     "Section 16 Information" shall mean the names of the Company Insiders, the
     number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each Company Insider and
     expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the
     number and a
                                      A-35
<PAGE>   36

     description of Company Stock Options held by each Company Insider and
     expected to be converted into options to acquire Parent Common Stock in
     connection with the Merger. "Company Insiders" shall mean those officers
     and directors of Company who will be subject to the reporting requirements
     of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent and whose names
     are included in the Section 16 Information.

          (f) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, with respect to each
     Company employee who agrees to waive the exercise of any Purchase Right (as
     defined in the Company ESPP) on any Purchase Date (as defined in the
     Company ESPP) after February 15, 2001, the Company ESPP and all Purchase
     Rights held by employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries who are
     participating in the Company ESPP, and Parent shall continue the assumed
     Company ESPP and the related offering and purchase periods thereunder (for
     the benefit of all persons who are employees of Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries as of the Closing and who have waived any Purchase Rights on
     any Purchase Date after February 15, 2001); provided, however, that: (i)
     each such assumed Purchase Right shall pertain to Parent Common Stock; (ii)
     the "Per Offering Share Limit" set forth in Section 8.1 of the Company ESPP
     shall be equal to the product of (A) five thousand (5,000) (without giving
     effect to the 100% stock dividend to be distributed by Company on or about
     March 13, 2000) multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
     nearest whole share; (iii) the maximum number of shares of Parent Common
     Stock issuable under the Company ESPP set forth in Section 4.1 of the
     Company ESPP shall be equal to the product of (A) three hundred thousand
     (300,000) (without giving effect to the 100% stock dividend to be
     distributed by Company on or about March 13, 2000) multiplied by (B) the
     Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (iv) the fair
     market value per share of Company Common Stock at the beginning of each
     Offering Period in effect at the Effective Time shall be equal to the fair
     market value per share of Company Common Stock at the beginning of such
     Offering Period divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
     whole cent. On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent a list of
     all holders of Purchase Rights who have consented to the waiver of all
     Purchase Rights on any Purchase Date after February 15, 2001 and the
     percentage of compensation to be deducted for each such holder. As promptly
     as reasonably practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) business
     days after receipt of all Company ESPP documentation it requires relating
     to outstanding assumed Purchase Rights, Parent shall file with the SEC a
     registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of Parent Common
     Stock issuable pursuant to Purchase Rights exercised under the assumed
     Company ESPP.

          (g) Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all action necessary to
     provide that no additional Offering Periods under the Company ESPP shall
     commence after the date of this Agreement, other than the Offering Period
     beginning on August 16, 2000, if applicable.

          (h) Within five (5) business days following the date of this
     Agreement, Company shall make available to Parent a list of all persons who
     Company reasonably believes (i) are, with respect to Company and as of the
     date of this Agreement, "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of
     Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated
     thereunder), and (ii) will be receiving payments or benefits (including
     acceleration of options) in connection with the Merger including any
     payments or benefits as a result of termination of service following the
     Merger. Within five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Company
     shall revise such list to reflect any additional information that Company
     reasonably believes would impact the determination of persons who (A) are,
     with respect to Company, such "disqualified individuals," and (B) will be
     receiving payments or benefits (including acceleration of options) in
     connection with the Merger including any payments or benefits as a result
     of termination of service following the Merger.

     Section 6.10  Affiliate Agreements. Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, Company will provide Parent with a list of those persons who are, in
Company's reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of Company, within the meaning of
Rule 145 (each such person who is an "affiliate" of Company within the meaning
of Rule 145 is referred to as an "Affiliate") promulgated under the Securities
Act ("Rule 145"). Company shall provide Parent such information and documents as
Parent shall reasonably request for

                                      A-36
<PAGE>   37

purposes of reviewing such list and shall notify Parent in writing regarding any
change in the identity of its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its Affiliates to
promptly deliver an executed affiliate agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Company.

     Section 6.11  Indemnification.

          (a) From and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent will, and Parent
     will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
     person who is or was a director or officer of Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries at or at any time prior to the Effective Time (an "Indemnified
     Party") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees),
     judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in
     settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
     or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
     arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission (or alleged action
     or omission) in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee,
     principal stockholder, fiduciary or agent of Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries or benefit plans whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
     after the Effective Time and (ii) Parent will cause the Surviving
     Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
     pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and any of the
     Indemnified Parties in effect immediately prior the Effective Time (and
     Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
     incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided
     that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
     undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
     Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification).

          (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
     shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent available
     in the market) in effect a directors' and officers' liability insurance
     policy covering those persons who currently or in the future are covered by
     Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a copy of
     which has been heretofore delivered to Parent) with coverage in amount and
     scope at least as favorable as the coverage currently planned by Company
     and described on Schedule 6.11(b); provided, however, that in no event
     shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any
     given year for such coverage in excess of one hundred fifty percent (150%)
     of the annual premium quoted to Company for such coverage as disclosed by
     Company to Parent on Schedule 6.11(b) (the "Current Premium"); and if the
     annual premium for such coverage would at any time exceed one hundred fifty
     percent (150%) of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
     maintain insurance policies which provide the maximum and best coverage
     available at an annual premium equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of
     the Current Premium.

          (c) Without limiting any of the rights of any of the Indemnified
     Parties set forth in the other provisions of this Section 6.11, for a
     period of six years after the Effective Time, to the extent there is any
     claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
     after the Effective Time) against or involving any Indemnified Party that
     arises out of or pertains to any action or omission (or alleged action or
     omission) in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee,
     principal stockholder, fiduciary or agent of Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries or benefit plans occurring prior to the Effective Time, such
     Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be represented by counsel and
     following the Effective Time (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified
     Parties shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and
     Parent, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall pay as incurred the
     reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements
     therefor are received, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation and Parent will
     cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that
     neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable for any
     settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided, further,
     that, in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are
     asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
     in respect to any such claim or claims shall continue until the final
     disposition of any and all such claims. The Indemnified Parties as a group
     may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to any single
     action unless such law firm determines that there is, under applicable
                                      A-37
<PAGE>   38

     standards of professional conduct, a material risk of conflict on any
     significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
     Parties.

          (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree
     to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be
     incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
     obligations provided for in this Section 6.11 to the extent that such
     Indemnified Party is determined to be entitled to indemnification under
     this Section 6.11.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be in addition
     to the rights otherwise available to the Indemnified Parties by law,
     charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of,
     and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, and their
     heirs, representatives, successors and assigns.

     Section 6.12  Benefit Plans.

          (a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
     Time and continuing for a reasonable period thereafter, the employees of
     Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with benefits
     under employee benefit plans (other than stock option or other plans
     involving the potential issuance of securities) which on average are
     substantially as favorable in the aggregate as those currently provided by
     Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees (except with respect to the
     401(k) plan as provided below).

          (b) Unless Parent consents otherwise in writing, Company shall take
     all action necessary to terminate, or cause to be terminated, before the
     Effective Time, any Company Employee Plan that is a 401(k) plan or other
     defined contribution retirement plan. Parent shall permit the rollover of
     the accounts of participants in the Company 401(k) plans to the Parent
     401(k) plan (including outstanding loans of those participants who became
     employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or who remain employees of
     the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries).

          (c) Upon the termination of the Company welfare plans, Parent shall
     include Company employees in Parent's welfare plans (within the meaning of
     Section 3(1) of ERISA) and fringe benefit plans on the same basis and terms
     as similarly situated Parent employees currently participate. All welfare
     benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which employees of
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries participate after the Effective Time
     shall (i) recognize expenses and claims that were incurred by such
     employees in the year in which the Effective Time occurs toward applicable
     co-payments, out of pocket maximums and deductibles, and (ii) provide
     coverage for preexisting health conditions to the extent covered under the
     applicable plans or programs of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
     the Effective Time. In addition, for eligibility purposes (including
     waiting period and evidence of insurability), under plans of the Surviving
     Corporation or Parent, service by an employee for Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries and any predecessor prior to the Effective Time shall be taken
     into account to the same extent as service for Parent; provided, however,
     that nothing herein shall require the inclusion of any such employee in any
     such plan prior to the Effective Time, and provided further, that in
     determining the amount of vacation pay owed to any such employee from and
     after the Effective Time under the applicable terms of the vacation pay
     plan of the Surviving Corporation or Parent (which terms need not be
     comparable to the terms of the vacation plan or policy of Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries and any predecessor, corporation or entity), credit shall
     be given for such employee's service for Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     and any predecessor, corporation or entity prior to the Effective Time.
     Without limiting the effect of Section 6.09(f), employees of Company or any
     of its Subsidiaries and any predecessor corporation or entity as of the
     Effective Time shall be permitted to participate in Parent's Employee Stock
     Purchase Plan (the "Parent ESPP") commencing on the first enrollment date
     following the Effective Time, subject to compliance with the eligibility
     provisions of such plan (with employees receiving credit, for purposes of
     such eligibility provisions, for service with Company or any of its
     subsidiaries and any predecessor corporation or entity.

                                      A-38
<PAGE>   39

          (d) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
     arrangement maintained by Parent (the "Parent Employee Plans") in which
     employees of Company or its Subsidiaries subsequently participate, Parent
     will recognize such employee's cumulative prior service to Company and its
     Subsidiaries (and any predecessor corporation or entity) for purposes of
     determining eligibility to participate in and for the vesting of benefits
     under such Parent Employee Plans to the same extent as service for Parent;
     provided, that such recognition shall not be for the purpose of determining
     retirement benefits and accrual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a
     period of no less than one year after the Effective Time, Parent shall
     provide severance and termination benefits (other than acceleration of
     option vesting) to employees of Company and its Subsidiaries that are no
     less favorable than those provided by Company or its Subsidiaries to such
     Company employees as of the date hereof.

     Section 6.13  Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to Company or any of
its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Company which
should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Company shall promptly
inform Parent. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to
Parent or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement
or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly
inform Company.

                              CONDITIONS TO MERGER

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                           TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     Section 8.01  Termination. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the receipt of stockholder approvals, this Agreement may be
terminated:

          (a) by mutual consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
     Parent and Company;

          (b) by either Parent or Company, if the Closing shall not have
     occurred on or before September 15, 2000 (provided, however, that (i) the
     right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b) shall not be
     available to any party whose action or failure to act has been the cause
     of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such
     date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of
     this Agreement, and (ii) if (A) on September 15, 2000 the condition to
     closing set forth in Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) has not been
     satisfied or waived or the Closing cannot otherwise occur due to any action
     taken or threatened to be taken or any failure to act by a Governmental
     Entity or federal, state or foreign court of competent jurisdiction, and
     (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the conditions to closing set
     forth in Section 7.01(b) and Section 7.01(c) can be satisfied and the
     Closing can otherwise occur notwithstanding any action taken or threatened
     to be taken or any failure to act by a Governmental Entity or federal,
     state or foreign court of competent jurisdiction, then either party may, in
     its sole discretion, extend the date referred to in this paragraph by up to
     90 days);

          (c) by Parent, if (i) Company shall have breached any representation
     or warranty in this Agreement, or shall breach any obligation or agreement
     hereunder, in a manner that, if uncured, would cause any condition
     precedent to the Closing set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied, and
     such breach shall not have been cured within twenty (20) business days of
     receipt by Company of written notice of such breach and a description of
     the principal details of such breach; provided, however, that the right to
     terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(c)(i) shall not be
     available to Parent where Parent is at that time in material breach of this
     Agreement; or (ii) the Board of Directors of Company shall have omitted its
     recommendation in favor of adoption of this Agreement from the Joint Proxy
     Statement/Prospectus or shall have withdrawn or modified its recommendation
     in favor of adoption of this Agreement in a manner adverse to Parent or
     recommended, endorsed, accepted or agreed to accept a Company Takeover
     Proposal or resolved to do any of the foregoing;

          (d) by Company, if Parent shall have breached any representation or
     warranty this Agreement, or shall breach any obligation or agreement
     hereunder, in a manner that, if uncured, would cause any condition
     precedent to the Closing set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied, and
     such breach shall not have been cured within twenty (20) business days
     following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach and a
     description of the principal details of such breach; provided, however,
     that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) shall
     not be available to Company where Company is at that time in material
     breach of this Agreement;

          (e) by Parent if (i) any permanent injunction or other order of a
     court or other competent authority preventing the consummation of the
     Merger shall have become final and nonappealable, (ii) any required
     approval of the stockholders of Company with respect to this Agreement or
     the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain
     the required vote upon a vote
                                      A-41
<PAGE>   42

     taken at a duly held meeting of Company stockholders (or at any adjournment
     or postponement thereof permitted by Section 6.05(a)), or (iii) the
     exemption described in Section 6.01(b) shall not have been obtained (or
     shall be unavailable), the arrangements described in Section 6.01(b) shall
     not have been made (or shall be unavailable), and the approval of the
     Parent Voting Proposal shall not have been obtained by reason of the
     failure to obtain the required vote upon a vote taken at a duly held
     meeting of Parent stockholders (or at any adjournment or postponement
     thereof permitted by Section 6.05(a)) (provided, however, that the right to
     terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e)(iii) shall not be
     available to Parent if the failure to obtain such exemption, the failure to
     make such arrangements and the failure to obtain such Parent stockholder
     approval, is attributable to an action or omission by Parent in material
     breach of this Agreement;

          (f) by Company if (i) any permanent injunction or other order of a
     court or other competent authority preventing the consummation of the
     Merger shall have become final and nonappealable, (ii) any required
     approval of the stockholders of Company with respect to this Agreement or
     the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain
     the required vote upon a vote taken at a duly held meeting of Company
     stockholders (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof permitted by
     Section 6.05(a)), or (iii) the exemption described in Section 6.01(b) shall
     not have been obtained (or shall be unavailable), the arrangements
     described in Section 6.01(b) shall not have been made (or shall be
     unavailable) and the approval of the Parent Voting Proposal shall not have
     been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a
     vote taken at a duly held meeting of Parent stockholders (or at any
     adjournment or postponement thereof permitted by Section 6.05(a))
     (provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
     this Section 8.01(f)(iii) shall not be available to Company if the failure
     to obtain such Company stockholder approval is attributable to an action or
     omission by Company in material breach of this Agreement);

          (g) by Parent if (i) Company actively and directly solicits,
     initiates, encourages or induces the making, submission or announcement of
     any Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not any Company Takeover Proposal
     in fact results therefrom), and (ii) such action on the part of Company
     constitutes a willful and material breach by Company of Section 6.02(a)(i);
     provided, however, that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
     Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(g) if, in each instance, more than
     ten (10) business days shall have elapsed since any of Parent's directors
     or executive officers first obtained confirmation of such willful and
     material breach by Company of Section 6.02(a)(i) or if Parent shall then be
     in material breach of this Agreement; or

          (h) by Company, in response to a Company Superior Offer which was not
     solicited by Company in violation of this Agreement; provided, however,
     that Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
     this Section 8.01(h) if such Company Superior Offer is attributable to a
     violation by Company of its obligations under Sections 6.02 and 6.05; and
     provided further, that no termination pursuant to this Section 8.01(h)
     shall be effective until after (i) seventy-two (72) hours following
     Parent's receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of
     Directors of Company is prepared to accept a Company Superior Offer,
     specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Offer
     and identifying the person making such Company Superior Offer and (ii) the
     payment of any applicable Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03.

     Section 8.02  Effect Of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent or
Company or their respective officers, directors, securityholders or affiliates,
except as provided in Section 8.03 and except to the extent of a breach by a
party hereto of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement involving fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct. The provisions of Section 8.03 and this Section 8.02 shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

     due pursuant to this Section 8.03 and, in order to obtain such payment,
     Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment or settlement for the
     fee set forth in this Section 8.03, Company shall pay to Parent its costs
     and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
     connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee

hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,

by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by a written instrument signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

     Section 8.05  Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time
any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the

party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii)
