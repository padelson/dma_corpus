   4. | Scheme 
---|--- 



   4.1 | Outline of Scheme 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The parties agree that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Biota will propose the Scheme; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Scheme, if approved by the Court, will be subject to
any alterations or conditions that are made or required by the Court and
approved in writing by each party.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Subject to the Scheme becoming Effective, on the
Implementation Date the general effect of the Scheme will be as follows: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | all of the Scheme Shares will be transferred to Nabi in
accordance with the terms of the Scheme; and 
---|---|---

 |  |

   ![LOGO](g338254g40u83.jpg) 


 


      | (ii) | in consideration for the transfer to Nabi of all Scheme
Shares held by the Scheme Shareholders, the Scheme Shareholders will receive
the Scheme Consideration in accordance with clause 4.2 and the terms of the
Scheme. 
---|---|--- 



   4.2 | Scheme Consideration 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to the Scheme becoming Effective and clauses 4.2(b),
4.2(c) and 4.3, Nabi agrees in favour of Biota that, in consideration of the
transfer to Nabi of each Scheme Share under the Scheme, Nabi accepts such
transfer, and provides to each Scheme Shareholder 0.669212231 New Nabi Shares
for each Scheme Share held by them; provided, however, that if Nabi completes
an issuer tender offer that is a Permissible Nabi Stockholder Cash
Transaction, then the number of New Nabi Shares for each Scheme Share shall be
a number determined in accordance with the following formula: 
---|---|--- 
 



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

0.669212231 x

 |  | NN  NTO 
    | NN 
 

Where:

NN is the number of Nabi Shares outstanding as at the date of this Agreement
(42,877,581) plus 1,277,386 (being one-third of the number of Nabi stock
options on issue as at the date of this Agreement). 

NTO is the number of Nabi Shares acquired by Nabi in the issuer tender offer.

(It is noted that the purpose of this formula is to preserve the respective
percentage shares of Nabis issued stock to be held immediately after the
Implementation Date by Scheme Shareholders (collectively) on the one hand
(being 73.9603%) and Nabi Stockholders immediately prior to the Implementation
Date (collectively) on the other hand (being 26.0397%) (subject in each case
to rounding) following the issuer tender offer)



     | (b) | If the number of Scheme Shares held by a Scheme Shareholder
as at the Record Date is such that the aggregate entitlement of the Scheme
Shareholder to Scheme Consideration includes a fractional entitlement to a
New Nabi Share, then the entitlement of that Scheme Shareholder must be
rounded up or down, with any such fractional entitlement of less than 0.5
being rounded down to the nearest whole number of New Nabi Shares, and any
such fractional entitlement of 0.5 or more being rounded up to the nearest
whole number of New Nabi Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If Nabi is of the opinion (acting reasonably) that two or
more Scheme Shareholders (each of whom holds a number of Scheme Shares that
results in rounding in accordance with clause 4.2(b)) have, before the Record
Date, been party to shareholding splitting or division in an attempt to obtain
unfair advantage by reference to such rounding, Nabi may give notice to those
Scheme Shareholders:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | setting out their names and registered addresses as shown in
the Biota Register; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | stating that opinion; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | attributing to one of them specifically identified in the
notice the Scheme Shares held by all of them, 
---|---|--- 
 

and, after such notice has been given, the Scheme Shareholder specifically
identified in the notice as the deemed holder of all the specified Scheme
Shares will, for the purposes of the Scheme, be taken to hold all of those
Scheme Shares and each of the other Scheme Shareholders whose names and
registered addresses are set out in the notice will, for the purposes of the
Scheme, be taken to hold no Scheme Shares. Nabi, in complying with the other
provisions of the Scheme relating to it in respect of

Agreement

 



 |  |

   ![LOGO](g338254g40u83.jpg) 


 


 

 the Scheme Shareholder specifically identified in the notice as the deemed
holder of all the specified Scheme Shares, will be taken to have satisfied and
discharged its obligations to the other Scheme Shareholders named in the
notice under the terms of the Scheme.



   4.3 | Treatment of Ineligible Foreign Biota Shareholders 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Nabi will be under no obligation under the Scheme to issue,
and will not issue, any New Nabi Shares to any Ineligible Foreign Biota
Shareholder, and instead Nabi will issue on the Implementation Date the New
Nabi Shares to which that Ineligible Foreign Biota Shareholder would otherwise
have been entitled (if they were a Scheme Shareholder who was not an
Ineligible Foreign Biota Shareholder) to a nominee appointed by Biota. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Biota will procure that, as soon as reasonably practicable
and in any event not more than 15 Business Days after the Implementation Date,
the nominee:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | sells on NASDAQ all of the New Nabi Shares issued to the
nominee in accordance with clause 4.3(a) in such manner, at such price and on
such other terms as the nominee determines in good faith, and at the risk of
the Ineligible Foreign Biota Shareholders; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | remits to Biota the proceeds of sale (after deducting any
reasonable applicable brokerage, stamp duty and other selling costs, taxes and
charges).  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Promptly after the last remittance in accordance with clause
4.3(b), Biota will pay to each Ineligible Foreign Biota Shareholder the
proportion of the net proceeds of sale received by Biota pursuant to clause
4.3(b)(ii) to which that Ineligible Foreign Biota Shareholder is entitled. 
---|---|--- 



   4.4 | Status of New Nabi Shares 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The New Nabi Shares to be issued pursuant to the Scheme
must, upon issue, rank equally in all respects with all other Nabi Shares then
on issue, except that they will not carry a right to receive any payments
from any Contingent Value Right issued and outstanding on the Implementation
Date or from any dividends declared prior to but remaining unpaid on the
Implementation Date, and will be fully paid and issued free from any
mortgage, charge, lien, encumbrance or other security interest; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The New Nabi Shares will be issued pursuant to an exemption
from registration under the 1933 Act pursuant to section 3(a)(10) of the 1933
Act. In the event that the exemption from registration under section 3(a)(10)
of the 1933 Act is not available for any reason to exempt the issuance of the
New Nabi Shares in accordance with the Scheme from the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act, then Nabi shall use its best endeavours to file
a registration statement on Form S-4 (or on such other form that may be
available to Nabi) in order to register such New Nabi Shares and shall use its
best endeavours to cause such registration statement to become effective at
or prior to the Implementation Date.

of this Agreement, the parties must use their best endeavours to agree in good
faith on any matters that, in addition to the matters agreed upon by biota
and Nabi prior to the date of this Agreement, comprise Nabi Cash Balance
Offsets (including any matters based on any unforeseen events or
circumstances).

stock of another person or entity, or has had its stock distributed by another

     | (P) | no Nabi Tax Returns contain any position which is or would

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( _ERISA_ ), and
deferred compensation, severance, stock option, stock purchase, stock

Benefit Plans_ ) other than Nabi Benefit Plans maintained outside of the
United States (such plans hereinafter referred to as _Nabi Non-U.S. Benefit

Pension Plan_ ) intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code,

any liability under section 4071 of ERISA, except for such taxes or penalties

Material Adverse Change; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (x) | no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Nabi or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with Nabi under section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or section 414(b) or

---|---|--- 



     | (xi) | all contributions required to be made on or prior to the
date of this Agreement under each Nabi Benefit Plan have been timely made or
accrued and, to the extent required by applicable law, all obligations in
respect of each Nabi Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in
the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference
in Nabi SEC Reports prior to the date of this Agreement;

threatened, litigation relating to Nabi Benefit Plans. Except as fairly
disclosed in the Nabi Disclosed Information, neither Nabi nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under
any Nabi ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement, except for health
continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA; 
---|---|--- 



     | (xiii) | except as fairly disclosed in the Nabi Disclosed
Information, neither Nabi nor any Nabi ERISA Affiliate maintains, contributes
to, or has any liability or potential liability under (or with respect to)
any Nabi Benefit Plan that is a (a) plan or arrangement which is subject to
(i) the minimum funding requirements of Code Section 412, (ii) Part 3 of Title
I of ERISA, or (iii) Title IV of ERISA, (b) "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA), (c) multiple employer plan, including any multiple
employer welfare arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), (d)
voluntary employees beneficiary association (within the meaning of Code
Section 501(c)(9)) or (e) welfare benefit fund (within the meaning of Code
Section 419), (f) nonqualified deferred compensation plan as described in
Code Section 409A, or (g) self-funded group health plan; 
---|---|--- 



     | (xiv) | no Nabi Group Member is involved in any material
industrial dispute or other material dispute with any trade or industrial
union or an association, group of employees or individual employee and, as
far as Nabi is aware, no dispute of this type has been threatened; 
---|---|--- 



     | (xv) | except as fairly disclosed in the Nabi Disclosed
Information, there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract
covering any current or former employee or other service provider of Nabi or
any of its Subsidiaries that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other such agreements, plans, arrangements or other
contracts, will, or could reasonably be expected to, as a result of
the transactions and agreements contemplated hereby, give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that could reasonably be expected to
be non-deductible by operation of Section 162(m) of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state or local law) or characterised as an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state or local law). Except as set forth in the
Nabi Disclosed Information, there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other
contract which provides for the gross-up of any taxes imposed on an individual
as a result of Section 4999 of the Code. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (xvi) | all Nabi Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material
respects with applicable laws except for such failures or omissions as are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to be a Nabi
Material Adverse Change. All Nabi Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed in the
Nabi Disclosed Information. Nabi and its Subsidiaries have no material
unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Nabi Non-U.S. Benefit Plan; 
---|---|--- 



     | (xvii) | each nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to
Section 409A of the Code to which Nabi is a party complies with the
requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Section 409A(a) of the Code by
its terms and has been operated in accordance with such requirements. After
December 31, 2004, all options granted by Nabi after December 31, 2004 have
been granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value
of Nabis common stock (as determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Section 409A and 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder)
on the date such options were granted or re-priced, and Nabi has incurred or
would not reasonably be expected to incur any liability or obligation to
withhold taxes under Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting of any options.
In addition, except as disclosed on Nabi Disclosed Information, there is no
agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract which provides for the gross-up
of any taxes imposed on an individual as a result of Section
409A(a)(1)(B)(i)(ii) of the Code; and

---|--- 



     | (a) | The obligations in clause 11.3(a), clause 11.4(a) and clause
11.5(a) do not apply to the extent that they restrict Biota, the Biota Board
or any of its Representatives from taking any action in respect of a bona
fide written Competing Proposal for Biota which was not encouraged, solicited,
invited, facilitated or initiated by Biota in contravention of clause 11.2, or
to the extent that they require Biota to provide the notification referred to
in clause 11.5, provided that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Biota Board, acting in good faith, after consulting with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisers, and in order to satisfy what
the Biota Board considers to be its fiduciary or statutory duties, determines
that the Competing Proposal is, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Biota Board, acting in good faith, after consulting
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisers, determines that not
undertaking that act would, or would be likely to, involve a breach of the
fiduciary or statutory duties owed by any Biota Director, 
---|---|--- 

and a prior written notice is sent promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days prior to taking any action) from Biota to Nabi of its intention
to take such proposed actions and the reasons therefor, that it is relying on
the carve out in this clause 11.6(a) and a summary of material terms and
conditions of such Competing Proposal. Biota must ask the person who has made
the applicable Competing Proposal (the _Competing Party_ ) for their consent
to their name and other identifying details which may identify the Competing
Party ( _Identifying Details_ ) being provided by Biota to Nabi on a
confidential basis. If consent is refused, Biota may only withhold the
Identifying Details from Nabi if the Biota Board, acting in good faith and
after having taken advice from its legal advisers, determines that failing to
do so would be likely to involve a breach of the fiduciary or statutory duties
owed by any Biota director. If information is withheld pursuant to
this clause 11.6(a), Biota must immediately notify Nabi. Any information
provided pursuant to this clause 11.6(a) will be provided subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



     | (b) | The obligations in clause 11.3(b), clause 11.4(b) and clause
11.5 do not apply to the extent that they restrict Nabi, the Nabi Board or any
of its Representatives from taking any action in respect of a bona fide
Competing Proposal for Nabi which was not encouraged, solicited, invited,
facilitated or initiated by Nabi in contravention of clause 11.2, or to the
extent that they require Nabi to provide the notification referred to in
clause 11.5, provided that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Nabi Board, acting in good faith, after consulting with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisers, and in order to satisfy what
the Nabi Board considers to be its fiduciary or statutory duties, determines
that, the Competing Proposal is, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Nabi Board, acting in good faith, after consulting with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisers, determines that not
undertaking that act would, or would be likely to, involve a breach of the
fiduciary or statutory duties owed by any Nabi Director, 
---|---|--- 

and a prior written notice is sent promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days prior to taking any action) from Nabi to Biota of its intention
to take such proposed actions and the reasons therefor, that it is relying on

conditions of such Competing Proposal. Nabi must ask the Competing Party for
their consent to their name and the Identifying Details being provided by Nabi
to Biota on a confidential basis. If consent is refused, Nabi may only
withhold the Identifying Details from Biota if the Nabi Board, acting in good
faith and after having taken advice from its legal advisers, determines that
failing to do so would be likely to involve a breach of the fiduciary or
statutory duties owed by any Nabi director. If information is withheld
pursuant to this clause 11.6(a), Nabi must immediately notify Biota. Any
information provided pursuant to this clause 11.6(a) will be provided subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

      | (c) | If clauses 11.6(a) or 11.6(b) override the restrictions in
clauses 11.4(a) or 11.4(b) (as applicable), the relevant party must not
provide any confidential information to a Third Party, before the Third Party
has entered into a written agreement in favour of the relevant party regarding
the use and disclosure of the confidential information by the Third Party and
that restricts the Third Partys ability to solicit the employees of that
party and its Related Bodies Corporate ( _Third Party Confidentiality
Agreement_ ). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | During the period of two clear Business Days referred to in
clause 11.6(a) (in the event of a Competing Proposal for Biota) or clause
11.6(b) (in the event of a Competing Proposal for Nabi), the party that has
not received the Competing Proposal will have the right to offer to amend the
terms of the Scheme (a _Counterproposal_ ) so that the terms of the Scheme (as
amended) would provide an equivalent or superior outcome for the shareholders
than the applicable Competing Proposal. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The party that has received the Competing Proposal must
procure its Board to consider any such Counterproposal and, if the Board
determines, acting in good faith and after having taken advice from its legal
and financial advisers: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Counterproposal is capable of being completed, taking
into account all aspects of the Counterproposal, including its conditions; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | would, if completed substantially in accordance with its
terms, be more favourable to the Biota Shareholders than the Competing
Proposal viewed in aggregate, taking into account a qualitative assessment of
the identity, reputation and financial standing of the party making the
Competing Proposal, 
---|---|--- 

then Biota and Nabi must use their best endeavours to agree the amendments to
the Transaction Documents that are reasonably necessary to reflect the
Counterproposal (including any amendments to the Scheme Consideration that
are reasonably necessary to reflect the Counterproposal), and to enter into
one or more appropriate amended agreements to give effect to those amendments
and to implement the Counterproposal, in each case as soon as
reasonably practicable, and the party that received the Counterproposal must
use its best endeavours to procure that its Board continues to recommend the
Counterproposal to its shareholders and not the applicable Competing Proposal.

 



     | (f) | Any material modification to any Competing Proposal (which
will include any material modification relating to the price or value of any
Competing Proposal) will be taken to make that proposal a new Competing
Proposal in respect of which the parties must comply with their obligations
under this clause 11.6. 
---|---|--- 



   11.7 | Normal provision of information 
---|--- 

Nothing in this clause 11 prevents a party from:



     | (a) | providing information to its Representatives; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | providing information to any Governmental Agency; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | providing information to its auditors, Advisers, customers,
joint venturers and suppliers acting in that capacity in the ordinary course
of business;  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | providing information required to be provided by law or any
Governmental Agency; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | making presentations to brokers, portfolio investors,
analysts and other third parties in the ordinary course of business.

---|--- 

A failure to exercise or a delay in exercising any right, power or remedy

remedy. A waiver is not valid or binding on the party granting that waiver
unless made in writing. For the avoidance of doubt, the doctrine of
affirmation by election will not apply to any failure by a party to exercise,
or delay by a party in exercising, any right, power or remedy under this
Agreement.

their subject matter. Neither party has relied on or is relying on any other
Conduct in entering into this Agreement and completing the Transactions. If
