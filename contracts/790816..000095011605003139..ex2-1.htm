Merger Sub"), Prentiss Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Company"), and Prentiss Properties Acquisition Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Company L.P.").

 

 **RECITALS:**

 

 WHEREAS, the board of trustees of the Company (the "Company Board") has approved and declared the merger (the "REIT Merger") of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub to be the surviving entity (except as provided in Article X), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding common share of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Shares") (except for shares owned or held by Parent, Parent L.P., the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries) shall be converted into the right to receive the REIT Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and desires to provide herein, in accordance with Title 8 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended ("Maryland REIT Law") and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the "MLLCA");

 

 WHEREAS, the Company, as sole general partner (through a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary) of Company L.P., has approved and declared this Agreement advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Company L.P. and its partners and desires to provide herein, in accordance with the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act ("DRULPA") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act ("DLLCA"), for the merger (the "OP Merger") of L.P. Merger Sub with and into Company L.P. immediately following the REIT Merger, with Company L.P. to be the surviving entity, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each Company Common Unit owned by the limited partners of Company L.P.

Merger Sub, the Company and Company L.P. desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the REIT Merger and the OP Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the REIT Merger and the OP Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 **ARTICLE I** 
 **The Mergers**

 

 Section 1.01. _The Mergers_.

 

 (a) _REIT Merger_.  Except as provided in Section 10.5, on the terms and subject to the conditions  set forth in this Agreement, at the REIT Effective Time, the Company  shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. Except as provided in Section  10.5, at the REIT Effective Time, the separate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving company (the "Surviving Company").

 

 (b) _OP Merger_.  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,  immediately following the REIT Merger, L.P. Merger Sub shall be merged  with and into Company L.P. At such time, the separate existence of L.P.  Merger Sub shall cease and Company L.P. shall continue as the surviving partnership (the "Surviving L.P.").

 

 Section 1.02. _Closings._

 (c) The closing of the OP Merger (the "OP Closing" and, together with the REIT Closing, the "Closing") shall take place immediately after the effectiveness of the REIT Merger at the offices identified above. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

The REIT Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, or at such later time as Parent L.P. and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger; provided, however, that if Parent shall not have received the Private Letter Ruling that confirms the matters referred to in Section 6.22 before the Final Condition Satisfaction Date, the Company shall file the Articles of Merger with the State Department of Assessment and Taxation of Maryland on the Final Condition Satisfaction Date to be effective on the following business day at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (the time at which the REIT Merger becomes effective being the "REIT Effective Time").

Merger Sub and Company L.P. shall prepare, and, immediately after the REIT Effective Time or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, Company L.P. shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger and/or such other appropriate documents (the "OP Merger Certificate") executed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DRULPA and the DLLCA and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DRULPA and the DLLCA to effect the OP Merger. The OP Merger shall become effective at such time as the OP Merger Certificate is duly filed with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent L.P. and Company L.P. shall agree and specify in the OP Merger Certificate; provided, however, that if Parent shall not have received the Private Letter Ruling that confirms the matters referred to in Section 6.22 before the Final Condition Satisfaction Date, Company L.P. shall file the OP Merger Certificate with the of Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Final Condition Satisfaction Date to be effective on the following business day at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (the time at which the OP Merger becomes effective being the "OP Effective Time" and, together with the REIT Effective Time, the "Effective Time").

 (a) _Organizational Documents_. Except as provided in Section 10.5, from and after the REIT Effective Time, the operating agreement of Merger Sub shall be the operating agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 (b) _Management_. The officers of Merger Sub as of the REIT Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 Section 1.06. _Effect of the OP Merger on the Company L.P. Partnership Agreement_. The Company L.P. Partnership Agreement shall be amended and restated as of the OP Effective Time in accordance with the instructions of Parent and, as so amended, shall be the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Surviving L.P. until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 Section 1.07. _Effect of REIT Merger on Company Shares._

 __ __(a) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 1.08(c), the Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to provide that at the REIT Effective Time each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Company Common Shares granted under any of the Company Incentive Plans (each, a "Company Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be converted into an option to purchase Parent Common Shares (each, a "New Parent Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Option (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the Company Incentive Plans or other agreement set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter). Each New Parent Option shall be exercisable for a number of Parent Common Shares equal to (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to the Company Option to which such New Parent Option relates multiplied by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest share. The per share exercise price of each New Parent Option shall equal (A) the per share exercise price of the Company Option to which such New Parent Option relates divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent. For this purpose, the "Option Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the per share dollar value of the REIT Merger Consideration on the Closing Date (with the portion of the REIT Merger Consideration that consists of Parent Common Shares valued at the Closing Date Market Price) and the denominator of which is the Closing Date Market Price; provided, however, that if a Special Dividend is declared pursuant to Section 10.3, the Option Exchange Ratio shall be an amount equal to the foregoing plus an amount equal to the quotient that results from dividing the Special Dividend Amount by the Closing Date Market Price.

 

 __ __(b) Subject  to Section 1.08(c) and the terms of the Company Incentive Plans and applicable  Laws, the Company and Parent shall take any actions necessary and appropriate  to cause the Company Incentive Plans to be assumed by Parent at the REIT  Effective Time, and from and after the REIT Effective Time, except as  otherwise set forth herein, the terms of each Company Option and the  Company Incentive Plan under which such Company Option was initially  granted, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to the REIT Effective Time, shall continue to apply to the corresponding New Parent Option.

 

 __ __(c) Prior  to the REIT Effective Time and subject to the terms of the Company Incentive  Plans, the Company may, in its sole discretion, take all actions necessary  and appropriate to allow each holder of a Company Option (whether or  not exercisable or vested) to elect, in lieu of the treatment provided  in Section 1.08(a), to convert each Company Option so held into the right  to receive an amount of cash at the REIT Effective Time equal to the  product of (i) the excess, if any, of the sum of the per share dollar  value of the REIT Merger Consideration on the Closing Date (with the  portion of the REIT Merger Consideration that consists of Parent Common  Shares valued at the Closing Date Market Price) and the Special Dividend Amount, if any, over the per share exercise price of such Company Option and  (ii) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option  (such payment to be net of all applicable withholding taxes). The Company  shall notify Parent not later than five days prior to the REIT Effective  Time of the number of Company Options for which the treatment provided  in this Section 1.08(c) has been elected and the total amount of cash payable pursuant to such elections.

As a result of the OP Merger  and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at the OP Effective  Time, all Company Common Units converted as provided in the preceding sentence  shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall  cease to exist, and each holder of such Company Common Units shall thereafter  cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Units, except  the right to receive the OP Merger Consideration and any dividends or other  distributions to which such holder becomes entitled, all in accordance with Article II upon the exchange of such Company Common Unit; and

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the REIT Merger and the other Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and to make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and to take all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that Parent will not be required to agree to, or proffer to, (A) divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any of Parent's, the Company's or any of their respective Affiliates' businesses or (B) cease to conduct business or operations in any jurisdiction in which Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates conducts business or operations as of the date of this Agreement. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to obtain consents of all third parties necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation by such party or any of its Affiliates of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including without limitation obtaining the consents required under the agreements set forth on Section 3.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter or Section 4.03(b) of Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be); provided that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not agree to any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or certificates; (ii) to provide any material notices to third parties required to be provided by the Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time, including under any leases or insurance policies; and (iii) to comply in all material respects with the terms of the insurance policies.

 

 (b) In  connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Company  L.P. and the Company Board shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure  that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or  becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the REIT  Merger, the OP Merger or any of the other Transactions and (ii) if any  state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable  to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the REIT Merger, the OP Merger  or any of the other Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure  that the REIT Merger, the OP Merger and the other Transactions may be  consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of such  statute or regulation on the REIT Merger, the OP Merger and the other Transactions.

 

 (c) The  Company shall give notice to Parent within 48 hours of becoming aware  of any representation or warranty made by it and contained in this Agreement  becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section  7.02(a) would not be satisfied; provided that no such notification shall  affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the  parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 (d) Parent shall  give notice to the Company within 48 hours of becoming aware of any representation  or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming  untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 7.03(a)  would not be satisfied; provided that no such notification shall affect  the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 

 Section 6.04. _No Solicitation_. 

 

 (a) Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly take any other action to facilitate (including by the furnishing of non-public information) the submission of any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) agree to, approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. "Takeover Proposal" means any offer or proposal for any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of (i) 30% or more of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company, taken as a whole, or (ii) 30% or more in voting power of the outstanding Company Common Shares, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 30% or more in voting power of the outstanding Company Common Shares, or (iv) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reclassification, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction or series of transactions involving the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; provided, however, the sale of the Subject Properties shall not be a Takeover Proposal.

 

 (b) In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraph (a)  of this Section 6.04, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in  any event within two business days) after receipt or occurrence of (i)  any Takeover Proposal, (ii) any request for information with respect  to any Takeover Proposal or (iii) any inquiry, proposal, discussions  or negotiation with respect to any Takeover Proposal, and such notice  shall include the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover  Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal, discussion or negotiation  and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal, request  for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom discussions or negotiations  are taking place. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material  respects of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such inquiry, request or Takeover Proposal.

 

 (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall prohibit the Company and the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's  shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after  having obtained sufficient preliminary information upon which to make  such judgment), after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to  disclose would be reasonably likely to cause a breach of its duties under  applicable Law. Subject to Sections 6.04(e) and 8.01(d), in no event  shall the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof withdraw  (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw  (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), its position with respect  to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the REIT Merger, the OP Merger  or the other Transactions or adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.04 to the contrary, prior to the REIT Effective Time, the Company may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal not resulting from or arising out of a breach of Section 6.04(a) (provided that the Company shall not agree to any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person) and may furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to such Person pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements (on terms not less favorable to the Company than the terms (including standstill terms) of the Confidentiality Agreement, as such may be waived in accordance with Section 5.01(a)(xii)); provided that the Company Board shall be permitted to take any such action if, and only if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board (after having obtained sufficient preliminary information upon which to make such determination) has determined by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the members of the Company Board or any committee thereof to which the power to consider such matters has been delegated that (i) such Takeover Proposal would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to provide information to such Person or access or to engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person would be reasonably likely to cause a breach of the duties of the Company Board under applicable Law. "Superior Proposal" means a Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section 6.04(a), except that the reference to "30%" in such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%") whereby the Person making such proposal has on an unsolicited basis submitted a bona fide written proposal to the Company relating to any such transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor, taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) is more favorable to the Company's shareholders, from a financial point of view, than this Agreement and the REIT Merger, taken as a whole, and that is reasonably capable of being completed. The Company shall not provide any nonpublic information, which was not previously provided to Parent, regarding the Company to any other Person pursuant to this Section 6.04(d) unless such information is simultaneously provided to Parent.

 

 (e) If the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that failure to accept a Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to cause a breach of the duties of the trustees of the Company to the Company and its shareholders under applicable Law, the Company Board may inform the holders of Company Common Shares that it no longer believes that the REIT Merger is advisable and no longer recommends approval (a "Subsequent Determination"), but only at a time that is prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and after the third business day following Parent's receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Proposal specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation), identifying the person making the Superior Proposal and stating that it is considering a Subsequent Determination; provided, that (i) during such three business day period Parent does not make an offer that the Company Board shall have reasonably concluded in good faith (following consultation with its nationally recognized financial advisors and outside counsel) is more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than such Superior Proposal and (ii) at the end of such three business day period such Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal. At any time after the three business day period following notification to Parent of the Company's consideration to do so and if the Company has otherwise complied with the terms of this Section 6.04 (but in no event following approval of the REIT Merger pursuant to this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting), the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and enter into an agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal; provided that prior to such termination the Company shall have made payment to Parent of the full amounts, if any, required under Sections 8.03(c) and (d) to be paid at that time.

 Section 6.05. _Employees and Benefit Plans_.

 

 (a) Parent L.P. intends to interview Company employees and may in its discretion (taking into account the views of the Company) offer employment as of the Closing Date to employees of the Company (the "Company Employees")  on terms and conditions, including salary and bonus, which are no less  favorable than those under which the Company Employees are currently employed,  and with benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those  applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent L.P. as in effect  from time to time. Parent L.P. shall continue such salary, benefits and  bonuses of each Company Employee who accepts such offer of employment for  a period of one year from the Closing Date, unless such Company Employee voluntarily resigns or is terminated for cause.

 

 (b) Parent L.P. agrees that it shall interview Company executive employees (the "Corporate Employees")  with the goal of offering each such Corporate Employee a position with  Parent L.P. or any of its Affiliates reasonably comparable to the position  such Corporate Employee currently holds with the Company or any of its  Affiliates. Parent L.P. shall act in good faith taking into account the  staffing needs of Parent L.P. or any of its Affiliates and the qualifications  of the applicable Corporate Employee. Parent L.P. shall use reasonable  efforts to complete such interviews and make the offers contemplated  by this Section 6.05(b) no later than ten days prior to the Closing and,  at such time, shall provide a written notice to the Company identifying  the Corporate Employees that have received offers of employment. Offers,  if made, shall include compensation and bonus, which are no less favorable  than those under which Corporate Employees are currently employed and  with other benefits in line with similar positions at Parent L.P. or  any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no legal obligation  shall be created on Parent L.P. or any of its Affiliates to hire any such Corporate Employees.

 

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) the Company Employment Agreements and the Company's  obligations under the change of control arrangements and Company employee  severance policies identified, listed or described in Section 3.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 (d) Parent will honor in accordance with their terms, all vested accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are disclosed in Section 3.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. To the extent such agreements and policies were adopted or executed on or before the date of this Agreement, Parent acknowledges that a "change of control" within  the meaning of the Company Incentive Plans will occur on the Effective  Time and as a result, except as provided in Section 6.05(d) of the Company  Disclosure Letter, all vesting of unvested options will be accelerated  and all of them will vest. The Company may make any required employee matching  contributions under its 401(k) Plan in a manner consistent with historical practices.

 

 (e) With respect to any "employee benefit plan",  as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries, to the extent such plan is made available to an employee  of the Company, for all purposes (other than benefit accrual), service  with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their predecessors shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as applicable.

 

 (f) Parent shall waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such preexisting condition limitation would have been applicable under the comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Company employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

 (g) Without limiting the Company's obligations in Section 6.21, the Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to ensure that (i) the Amended and Restated Share Purchase Plan is terminated prior to the REIT Effective Time, and that no Company employee shall thereafter have any rights under the Amended and Restated Share Purchase Plan and (ii) participation in the Amended and Restated Share Purchase Plan is suspended as of the end of the first "Option Period" (as  defined in the Amended and Restated Share Purchase Plan) that occurs following the date of this Agreement.

 

 (h) Subject  to Section 6.05(a), nothing contained in this Section 6.05 or elsewhere  in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and after the Effective  Time, the termination of employment of any individual employee of the  Company or any change in the employee benefits available to any such  individual employee or the amendment or termination of any particular  Company Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement.

 (i) Parent acknowledges that, prior to December 31, 2005, or at such later time as may be permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance issued thereunder (collectively "Section 409A"),  and in accordance with, and to the extent permitted under Section 409A,  the participants in the Company Deferred Compensation Plans shall be permitted  to amend the timing and form of payments to be made under the Company Deferred  Compensation Plans, and thereafter, that the Company shall amend the Company  Deferred Compensation Plans to the extent necessary to conform to Section  409A. To the extent not already vested, the parties acknowledge that all  amounts currently deferred under the Company Deferred Compensation Plans  shall become vested at the Effective Time except to the extent otherwise  provided in Section 6.05(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Subject to  Section 409A, Parent shall assume the Company Deferred Compensation Plans  and maintain the Company Deferred Compensation Plans in accordance with  their respective terms for the benefit of the participants thereunder to  the extent that such participants maintain account balances after the Effective Time.

 

 Section 6.06. _Indemnification_.

 

 (a) Parent and  Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from  liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time now existing in favor of the current or former trustees or officers  of the Company as provided in the Company Organizational Documents and  indemnification agreements of the Company identified in Section 6.06 of  the Company Disclosure Letter shall be assumed by the Surviving Company  in the REIT Merger, without further action, at the REIT Effective Time  and shall survive the REIT Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

 (b) The Surviving Company shall (i) for a period of six years after the REIT Effective Time cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Company's (or any successor) charter and by-laws (or similar governing documents), provisions regarding elimination of liability of trustees, indemnification of officers, trustees and employees and advancement of expenses which are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries as those currently contained in the declaration of trust and by-laws of the Company and (ii) maintain for a period of at least six years the current policies of trustees' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, provided that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the REIT Effective Time) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the REIT Effective Time; including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage would exceed such amount, the Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. The provisions of this subsection (b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Surviving Company for purposes of this Section 6.06, which policies (together with the Company's existing policy) provide such trustees and officers with the coverage described in this subsection (b) for an aggregate period of not less than six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the REIT Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Company's obligations pursuant to this Section 6.06.

 

 (d) The  provisions of this Section 6.06 shall not be terminated or modified in  such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section  6.06 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee and are  intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

 

 Section 6.07. _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the OP Merger, the REIT Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

Units and/or Company Options, all Transfer Taxes.

 Section 6.13. _Redemption of Company Series D Preferred Shares_.

 Section 6.14. _Conversion of Company G.P._ Prior  to the REIT Effective Time, at Parent's election exercised by written notice to Company not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the REIT Effective Time, either (i) the Company shall cause Company G.P., its wholly owned subsidiary to convert from a corporation to a Delaware limited liability company or (ii) the Company and Company GP shall make a valid election on IRS Form 8875 to treat Company GP as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code effective prior to the REIT Effective Time (the conversion or election under (i) or (ii) is referred to herein as the "Company GP Conversion").  In the absence of such written notice by Parent to Company, Parent shall  be deemed to have elected alternative (i) above, and the Company shall cause  Company G.P. to convert from a corporation to a Delaware limited liability company prior to the REIT Effective Time. 

 Section 6.15. _Repayment  of PPREFI Portfolio Collateralized Loan_. Prior to the REIT Effective Time, the Company shall cause all mortgages and other liens securing the Company's PPREFI Portfolio collateralized loan (the "PPREFI Portfolio Loan") to be released such that they are free of any obligations relating to the PPREFI Portfolio Loan on or before Closing. 

 Section 6.16. _Registration Rights_.  The Company's registration rights agreements identified in Section  6.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter and registration rights of holders  of Company L.P. Units pursuant to the terms of the Company L.P. Partnership  Agreement will be assumed by Parent in accordance with their terms and the  holders of registration rights under such agreements shall have substantially  the same rights with respect to the registration of the securities of Parent  that such holders may receive on the Closing Date as a result of the REIT  Merger or the OP Merger as they currently possess under such agreements.  On the date hereof, Parent shall enter into a Registration Rights Agreement  with Michael V. Prentiss in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.  Parent agrees to use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to file,  on or within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, a shelf registration  statement (the "Shelf Registration Statement") pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act registering the resale of the Parent Common Shares (the "Registrable Securities") issuable by Parent upon the conversion or redemption of any Parent Class A Units received by persons who were holders of Company Common Units of Company L.P. immediately prior to the OP Merger. The Shelf Registration Statement shall be filed on Form S-3 and, if Parent is eligible, the Shelf Registration Statement shall utilize the automatic shelf registration process under Rule 415 and Rule 462 as amended by Securities Act Release No. 8591. Parent will use its best efforts to maintain its status as a "well known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 as amended by Securities Act Release No. 8591. If Parent is not a "well known seasoned issuer" or is otherwise ineligible to utilize the automatic shelf registration process, then Parent shall use its best efforts to have the Shelf Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as expeditiously as practicable. Parent will maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, including by filing any necessary post-effective amendments and prospectus supplements, or, alternatively, by filing new registration statements relating to the Registrable Securities as required by Rule 415 under the Securities Act to permit the disposition of all Registrable Securities pursuant hereto until the earliest date on which (i) all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or any successors thereto have been sold or (ii) all Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act. Parent acknowledges that the holders of the Company Common Units are third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.16.
