        duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
        by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
        a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of full Parent Common
        Shares into which the aggregate number of Company Common Shares previously
        represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
        this Agreement and the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to
        hereunder (including amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 1.07(a),

        evidencing the number of full Parent Series E Preferred Shares into which
        the aggregate number of Company Series D Common Shares previously represented

        such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose
        to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
        practices. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
        pursuant to Section 1.07, Section 2.03 or Section
2.05. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or more certificates

to Section 2.03, may be issued with respect to such Company Common Shares to
such a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Shares
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Series
D Preferred Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
one or more certificates of Parent Series E Preferred Shares evidencing, in the
aggregate, the proper number of Parent Series E Preferred Shares and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03

is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Provision shall be made for holders of Certificates to procure in person
immediately after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of
transmittal and Company Common Shares or Company Series D Preferred Shares, as
the case may be, in exchange for the REIT Merger Consideration or the Parent
Series E Preferred Shares, as applicable, and cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares and dividends and distributions, if any, pursuant to Section 2.03.</font></p>

Section&nbsp;5.01(a)(xii)); provided that the Company Board shall be permitted to take any such action if, and only if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board (after having obtained sufficient preliminary information upon which to make such determination) has determined by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the members of the Company Board or any committee thereof to which the power to consider such matters has been delegated that (i) such Takeover Proposal would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to provide information to such Person or access or to engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person would be reasonably likely to cause a breach of the duties of
the Company Board under applicable Law.  &#8220;Superior Proposal&#8221; means a Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section 6.04(a), except that the reference to &#8220;30%&#8221; in such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to &#8220;50%&#8221;) whereby the Person making such proposal has on an unsolicited basis submitted a bona fide written proposal to the Company relating to any such transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor, taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) is more favorable to the Company&#8217;s
shareholders, from a financial point of view, than this Agreement and the REIT
Merger, taken as a whole, and that is reasonably capable of being completed.
The Company shall not provide any nonpublic information, which was not previously
provided to Parent, regarding the Company to any other Person pursuant to this
Section 6.04(d) unless such information is simultaneously provided to Parent.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that failure to accept a Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to cause a breach of the duties of the trustees of the Company to the Company and its shareholders under applicable Law, the Company Board may inform the holders of Company Common Shares that it no longer believes that the REIT Merger is advisable and no longer recommends approval (a &#8220;Subsequent Determination&#8221;), but only at a time that is prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and after the third business day following Parent&#8217;s receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Proposal specifying the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (and including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation), identifying the person making the Superior Proposal and stating that it is considering a Subsequent Determination; provided, that (i) during such three business day period Parent does not make an offer that the Company Board shall have reasonably concluded in good faith (following consultation with its nationally recognized financial advisors and outside counsel) is more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than such Superior Proposal and (ii) at the end of such three business day period such Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal.  At any time after the three business day period following notification to Parent of the Company&#8217;s
consideration to do so and if the Company has otherwise complied with the terms
of this Section 6.04 (but in no event following approval of the REIT Merger pursuant
to this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting), the Company may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and enter into an agreement with respect
to the Superior Proposal; provided that prior to such termination the Company
shall have made payment to Parent of the full amounts, if any, required under
Sections 8.03(c) and (d) to be paid at that time.</font></p>

      applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent L.P. as in effect
      from time to time. Parent L.P. shall continue such salary, benefits and

        of the applicable Corporate Employee. Parent L.P. shall use reasonable
        efforts to complete such interviews and make the offers contemplated
        by this Section 6.05(b) no later than ten days prior to the Closing and,
        at such time, shall provide a written notice to the Company identifying
        the Corporate Employees that have received offers of employment. Offers,
        if made, shall include compensation and bonus, which are no less favorable
        than those under which Corporate Employees are currently employed and
        with other benefits in line with similar positions at Parent L.P. or
        any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no legal obligation

      Time and as a result, except as provided in Section 6.05(d) of the Company

therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, provided that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the REIT Effective Time) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the REIT Effective Time; including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage would exceed such amount, the Surviving
Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.  The provisions of this subsection (b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Surviving Company for purposes of this Section 6.06, which policies (together with the Company&#8217;s

    the same rights with respect to the registration of the securities of Parent
    that such holders may receive on the Closing Date as a result of the REIT

    On the date hereof, Parent shall enter into a Registration Rights Agreement
    with Michael V. Prentiss in the form attached hereto as <u>Exhibit B</u>.
    Parent agrees to use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to file,
    on or within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, a shelf registration
    statement (the &#8220;Shelf Registration Statement&#8221;) pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act registering the resale of the Parent Common Shares (the &#8220;Registrable Securities&#8221;) issuable by Parent upon the conversion or redemption of any Parent Class A Units received by persons who were holders of Company Common Units of Company L.P. immediately prior to the OP Merger.  The Shelf Registration Statement shall be filed on Form S-3 and, if Parent is eligible, the Shelf Registration Statement shall utilize the automatic shelf registration process under Rule 415 and Rule 462 as amended by Securities Act Release No. 8591.
Parent will use its best efforts to maintain its status as a &#8220;well known seasoned issuer&#8221; as defined in Rule 405 as amended by Securities Act Release No. 8591.  If Parent is not a &#8220;well known seasoned issuer&#8221; or
is otherwise ineligible to utilize the automatic shelf registration process,
then Parent shall use its best efforts to have the Shelf Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as expeditiously as practicable.
Parent will maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, including
by filing any necessary post-effective amendments and prospectus supplements,
or, alternatively, by filing new registration statements relating to the Registrable
Securities as required by Rule 415 under the Securities Act to permit the disposition
of all Registrable Securities pursuant hereto until the earliest date on which
(i) all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement or any successors thereto have been sold or (ii) all Registrable Securities
may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act. Parent acknowledges
that the holders of the Company Common Units are third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.16.</font>
