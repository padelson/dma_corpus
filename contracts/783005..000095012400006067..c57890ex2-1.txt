the Lee-NMBC Stations included within the Purchased Assets of the Lee-NMBC
Stations, minus the current liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations as of the close
of business on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Adjustment
Date"), each determined in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent
with the preparation of the Financial Statements, and adjusted to exclude (1)
from current assets the current portion of program rights and (2) from current
liabilities the current portion of program liabilities and any reserve or
accrual for loss contingencies required by GAAP related to the matters disclosed
in SCHEDULE 4.14 hereto; provided, however, that current liabilities shall
include the amount or value of both cash and noncash consideration that has not
been paid or provided prior to the Closing Date for programming run by any of
the Lee-NMBC Stations prior to the Closing Date.

                           (ii) Three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Lee shall provide Purchaser with a reasonably detailed statement (the
"Preliminary Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations") setting
forth Lee's reasonable and good faith estimate of the Working Capital of the
Lee-NMBC Stations. The Asset Purchase Cash Payment payable on the Closing Date
shall be decreased by the amount of any negative Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC
Stations shown on the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC
Stations or increased by the amount of any positive Working Capital of the
Lee-NMBC Stations shown on the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital of the
Lee-NMBC Stations.

                           (iii) As promptly as practicable, but in any event
within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing, Lee shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the


                                      -13-
<PAGE>   15
Purchaser a further determination and statement (the "Statement of Working
Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations") setting forth the Working Capital of the
Lee-NMBC Stations.

                           (iv) Within thirty (30) calendar days following
delivery of the Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations pursuant
to Section 2.3(b)(iii) hereof or, if applicable, such later date determined in
accordance with Section 2.3(b)(v) hereof, Lee shall pay the Purchaser the
amount, if any, by which the Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations shown on
the Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations is less than the
amount thereof shown on the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital of the
Lee-NMBC Stations or (B) the Purchaser shall pay to Lee the amount, if any, by
which the Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations shown on the Statement of
Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations is more than the amount thereof shown
on the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations. Any
and all payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(iv) shall bear interest at
the three (3) month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate published in the Wall Street
Journal on the Closing Date (the "Interest Rate") for the period commencing on
the Closing Date and to but not including the date of payment, and shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the party to receive such payment. Any payment made pursuant to this
Section 2.3(b)(iv) shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Asset Purchase
Price.

                           (v) If the Purchaser disagrees in good faith with the
Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations, then the Purchaser shall
notify Lee in writing (the "Asset Purchase Notice of Disagreement") of such
disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of the
Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations. The Asset Purchase Notice
of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the
disagreement described therein. Thereafter, Lee and the Purchaser shall attempt
in good faith to resolve and finally determine the amount of the Closing Working
Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations. If Lee and the Purchaser are unable to resolve
the disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of the
Asset Purchase Notice of Disagreement, then Lee and the Purchaser shall retain
the services of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (the "Independent Accountant"), to resolve
the disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto. The
determination by the Independent Accountant will be made, and written notice
thereof given to Lee and the Purchaser, within thirty (30) calendar days after
the Independent Accountant's retention. The determination by the Independent
Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Lee-NMBC and the
Purchaser. The scope of the Independent Accountant's engagement (which will not
be an audit) shall be limited to the resolution of the disputed items described
in the Asset Purchase Notice of Disagreement, and the recalculation, if any, of
the Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations in light of such
resolution. If an Independent Accountant is engaged pursuant to this Section
2.3(b)(v), the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
equally by Lee and the Purchaser. Any payment required by Section 2.3(b)(iv)
hereof shall bear interest at the Interest Rate for the period commencing on the
Closing Date and to but not including the date of payment, and shall be made
based on such determination within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of a
notice of determination by the Independent Accountant as described above,


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   16
                  (c) A11ocation of Asset Purchase Price. The Asset Purchase
Price shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets of the Lee-NMBC Stations for
all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) on the basis of a
customary appraisal report prepared by an independent appraisal firm which shall
be selected and whose report shall be approved by the Purchaser, or as agreed by
the parties. The Purchaser shall pay all fees, costs and expenses of the
appraisal firm. The appraisal report and allocation will be consistent with
Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Purchaser and Lee-NMBC shall (i)
execute and file all Tax Returns and prepare all financial statements, returns
and other instruments in a manner consistent with the allocation determined
pursuant to this Section 2.3(c), (ii) not take any position before any
Governmental Authority or in any judicial proceeding that is inconsistent with
such allocation, and (iii) cooperate with each other in a timely filing,
consistent with such allocation, of Form 8594 with the IRS.

         2.4 Further Assurances. At and after the Closing, and without further
consideration therefor, (i) Lee-NMBC shall execute and deliver to the Purchaser
such further instruments and certificates of conveyance and transfer as the
Purchaser may reasonably request in order to more effectively convey and
transfer the Purchased Assets of the Lee-NMBC Stations to the Purchaser and to
put the Purchaser in operational control of the Lee-NMBC Stations, or for
aiding, assisting, collecting and reducing to possession any of the Purchased
Assets of the Lee-NMBC Stations and exercising rights with respect thereto, and
(ii) the Purchaser shall execute and deliver to Lee such further instruments and
certificates of assumption, novation and release as Lee may reasonably request
in order to effectively make the Purchaser responsible for all Assumed
Liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations and release Lee-NMBC therefrom to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

         2.5 Nontransferable Contracts and Licenses. To the extent that transfer
or assignment hereunder by Lee-NMBC to the Purchaser of any Contracts of the
Lee-NMBC Stations or Licenses (other than the FCC Licenses) of the Lee-NMBC
Stations is not permitted or is not permitted without the consent of another
Person, this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking to
assign the same if such consent is not given or if such an undertaking otherwise
would constitute a breach thereof or cause a loss of benefits thereunder.
Lee-NMBC shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any and all
such third party consents under all Material Contracts of the Lee-NMBC Stations
and Material Licenses of the Lee-NMBC Stations; provided, however, that Lee-NMBC
shall not be required to pay or incur any cost or expense to obtain any third
party consent that Lee-NMBC is not otherwise required to pay or incur in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Material Contract of the Lee-NMBC
Stations or Material License of the Lee-NMBC Stations. Purchaser shall cooperate
with Lee-NMBC in obtaining such third party consents, provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not be required to agree to any change in the terms of any such
Contract or to pay any fee or other consideration to a third party in order to
obtain any such third party consent. Purchaser's cooperation shall include,
without limitation, signing and delivering consent forms which may be provided
by third parties to such Contracts pursuant to which Purchaser shall agree to
assume and perform the obligations of Lee-NMBC under such Contracts arising
during and relating to the period on and after the Closing Date. If any such
third party consent is not obtained before the Closing, Lee-NMBC shall cooperate
with the Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement


                                      -15-

designed to provide to the Purchaser on and after the Closing with the benefits
under the applicable Contract of the Lee-NMBC Stations or License of the
Lee-NMBC Stations, and Purchaser shall perform on and after the Closing Date the
applicable Contract and License and the financial obligations thereunder, as the
case may be, to the extent commensurate with the benefits actually received by
Purchaser thereunder. After the Closing Date, Lee-NMBC and Purchaser shall
continue to cooperate with one another and use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any such third party consents, and any such Contracts and Licenses
shall be deemed transferred or assigned upon Purchaser's receipt of any
necessary third party consent thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained above
in this Section 2.5 to the contrary, this Section 2.5 shall not apply to any FCC
License.

         2.6 The Stock Purchase. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, at the Closing Lee shall transfer, assign and deliver to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Lee, the KOIN Common Stock and the

       6.3 Confidentiality. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and

<PAGE>   43
be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist

                  (i) obtaining all necessary Material Licenses, including the
FCC Licenses, actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and other orders of any Governmental Authorities
with competent jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated hereby;

                  (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers

<PAGE>   44
            (c) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a temporary waiver of the FCC "Local Television Multiple Ownership" rule
to permit, for a period following consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, common ownership of (i) the television stations in the
Honolulu television market currently owned by Purchaser ("Purchaser's Hawaii
Stations") and (ii) the television stations in the Honolulu television market
that are the subject of this Agreement ("Lee-NMBC's Hawaii Stations") . In the
event that, as of the date which is sixty (60) days following the date of filing
of the FCC Transfer Application, communications counsel for Lee-NMBC, after due
evaluation, determines in such counsel's reasonable and good faith judgment that
such waiver is not likely to be granted or that FCC consent to the FCC Transfer
Application will be significantly delayed due to the pending waiver request,
Purchaser (i) shall, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a written request
by Lee-NMBC, file one or more applications (the "Spin-off Applications") with
the FCC to assign the licenses of either Purchaser's Hawaii Stations or
Lee-NMBC's Hawaii Stations, at Purchaser's election, to either (A) a qualified
trustee under a trust which will permit FCC approval of the FCC Transfer
Application or (B) a legally and financially qualified third-party purchaser
with which Purchaser shall have entered into a definitive agreement for the
purchase and sale of either Purchaser's Hawaii Stations or the Lee-NMBC Hawaii
Stations; and (ii) in either case, shall prosecute such application with due
diligence. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses
related to the Spin-off Applications. Lee-NMBC shall, when and as reasonably
requested by Purchaser, cooperate in the preparation, filing, and prosecution of
the Spin-off Applications. No assignment of licenses to a trustee or to any
other third party shall reduce or modify Purchaser's obligation to pay the full
amount of the Cash Payment pursuant to this Agreement.

Purchaser and Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company, hereby further agree to use
their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to (1) respond to any
request of any Governmental Authority for information, (2) contest and resist
any Action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial Action, and
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Governmental Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including by using all
legal efforts to vigorously pursue all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and all available legislative action, and (3) in the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other Governmental Order is entered
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prohibit, prevent, delay or
otherwise restrain the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to
cause the relevant Governmental Authorities to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the Termination Date.

       6.5 Fulfillment of Conditions by Lee-NMBC and the Acquired Companies.
Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company shall not knowingly take or cause to be
taken, or fail to take or cause to be taken, any action that would cause the
conditions to the obligations of such company or the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to fail to be satisfied or fulfilled at or
prior to the Closing, including by taking or causing to be taken, or failing to
take or cause to be taken, any action that would cause the representations and





                                      -43-
<PAGE>   45
warranties made by each company in Article 4 hereof to fail to be true and
correct as of the Closing in all material respects. Lee-NMBC and each Acquired
Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable actions
within its power to cause to be satisfied or fulfilled, at or prior to the
Closing, the conditions precedent to the Purchaser's obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in Section 7.1 hereof.

       6.6 Fulfillment of Conditions by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall not
knowingly take or cause to be taken, or fail to take or cause to be taken, any
action that would cause the conditions to the obligations of Lee-NMBC and each
Acquired Company or the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby to fail to be satisfied or fulfilled, including by taking or causing to
be taken, or failing to take or cause to be taken, any action that would cause
the representations and warranties made by the Purchaser in Article 5 hereof to
fail to be true and correct as of the Closing in all material respects. The
Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable actions
within its power to cause to be satisfied or fulfilled, at or prior to the
Closing, the conditions precedent to the obligations of such company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in Section 7.2
hereof. Purchaser will not cause any Acquired Company to take any action on the
Closing Date that is not in the ordinary course of business of such company.

       6.7 Publicity. Lee-NMBC and any Acquired Company and the Purchaser shall
cooperate with each other in the development and distribution of all news
releases and other public disclosures relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither Lee-NMBC or each Acquired Company nor the Purchaser
shall issue or make, or allow to have issued or made, any press release or
public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the consent of the other party hereto, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or stock exchange rules, but in any event only after giving the
other party hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or
announcement in advance, consistent with such applicable legal requirements.

       6.8 Transaction Costs. The Purchaser shall pay all transaction costs and
expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses
and other fees described in Section 5.5 hereof) that it incurs in connection
with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, any and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
spin-off of one of the Honolulu television stations pursuant to Section 6.4(c).
Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company shall pay all transaction costs and expenses
(including legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses and other
fees described in Section 4.21 hereof) that it incurs in connection with the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Lee and the Purchaser shall share
equally any filing fees in connection with the HSR Act or FCC Transfer
Application and any real estate transfer, sales, use and deed Taxes, or refunds
thereof, and the fees and costs of recording or filing all applicable
conveyancing instruments associated with the transfer of the Purchased Assets of

                                      -44-
<PAGE>   46
Lee-NMBC and the Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and

payable as a result of the transfer of the Purchased Assets of the Lee-NMBC
Stations from such company to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or the
Acquired Companies' Common Stock from Lee to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement.

       6.9  Employees and Employee Benefit Matters.

            (a) The Purchaser shall offer employment as of the Closing Date to
all of the Employees. As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall employ each of
the Employees whose employment is not covered by a collective bargaining
agreement and who accepts the Purchaser's offer of employment ("Transferred
Non-Union Employees"). Purchaser shall cause all Transferred Non-Union Employees
as of the Closing Date to be eligible to participate in its "employee welfare
benefit plans" and "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1)
and 3(2) of ERISA (respectively) of Purchaser in which similarly situated
employees of Purchaser are generally eligible to participate from time to time
("Purchaser's Plans"), and all Transferred Non-Union Employees shall be eligible
for coverage immediately after the Closing Date (and shall not be excluded from
coverage on account of any pre-existing condition) under Purchaser's Plans
constituting employee welfare benefit plans to the extent permitted under such
plans with respect to the Transferred Non-Union Employees. Following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser's Plans to recognize any prior accrued
service credit, credit towards satisfying deductible expense requirements and
out-of-pocket expense limits of Transferred Non-Union Employees for purposes of
Purchaser's Plans to the extent such prior service credits and limits are
recognized by Purchaser or the Purchaser's Plans for similarly situated
employees of Purchaser (including, but not limited to, eligibility to
participate and vesting, but excluding benefit accruals). As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make available to the Transferred
Non-Union Employees Purchaser's 401(k) Plan in accordance with the terms and
provisions of such plan. Lee-NMBC shall cause to be transferred to Purchaser's
401(k) Plan, in cash, all of the individual account balances of the Transferred
Non-Union Employees under the 401(k) plan in which the Employees now
participate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Employees
who become employed by the Purchaser as of the Closing who are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement on and after the Closing (the "Transferred Union
Employees" and, collectively with the Transferred Non-Union Employees, the
"Transferred Employees") shall receive benefits in accordance with the terms of
such agreement. Except for the employment contracts listed in SCHEDULE 4.10,
nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall guarantee employment for any
Transferred Non-Union Employees or Transferred Union Employees for any length of
time after the Closing Date.

            (b) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, Lee-NMBC shall cause each
of the Acquired Companies to cease to be a participating employer under, and
terminate its sponsorship of, each Benefit Plan. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.9(c), Lee-NMBC shall pay, discharge and be solely responsible for all
Liabilities which arise or become payable under any Benefit Plan as a result of,
or in connection with, the termination of any Employee before, upon or after
Closing, including, without limitation, all severance or termination pay and all
accrued




                                      -45-
<PAGE>   47
vacation, salary, wages and other compensation payments or benefits, if any,
which arise or become payable under any Benefit Plan as a result of or in
connection with such termination, except to the extent any such Liabilities are
included as Assumed Liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations or Acquired Companies
Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser shall pay, discharge and be solely responsible
for all Liabilities which arise or become payable as a result of or in
connection with Purchaser's employment of any Transferred Employees upon Closing
or Purchaser's termination of any Transferred Employees after Closing,
including, without limitation, all severance or termination pay and all accrued
vacation, salary, wages and other compensation payments or benefits under or
pursuant to any employee benefit plan of Purchaser. Purchaser shall not,
however, assume or be obligated to pay or perform any Liabilities under any
Benefit Plans (including, but not limited to, any stay bonus or severance
policy, plan, arrangement or benefit), except that (i) Purchaser shall provide
vacations to Transferred Employees to the extent such vacations are accrued and
included as either (A) liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations in the determination
of the Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations or (B) the Acquired Companies
Closing Liabilities, and (ii) Purchaser shall assume and agree to perform the
employer's obligations under the employment contracts included in the Contracts
of the Lee-NMBC Stations or the Acquired Companies and listed in SCHEDULE
4.10(a) hereto to the extent such obligations arise during and are attributable
to any period after Closing.

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 6.9, upon
consummation of the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) recognize the union which is a
party to the collective bargaining agreement set forth in SCHEDULE 4.20 hereto,
and (ii) assume and be responsible for the obligations of Lee-NMBC under such
collective bargaining agreement to the extent such obligations arise during and
are attributable to any period after Closing.

            (d) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser's obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.9 are in addition to, and not in limitation of,
Purchaser's assumption of the employer's obligations under the employment
agreements included in the Contracts of the Lee-NMBC Stations or the Acquired
Companies' Stations and listed in SCHEDULE 4.10(a) hereto to the extent such
obligations arise during and are attributable to any period after Closing.

            (e) The covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 6.9 shall
be solely for the benefit of, and shall only be enforceable by, the parties to
this Agreement and their permitted assigns. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall provide or be construed to
provide any Employees with any rights under this Agreement, and no Person, other
than the parties to this Agreement, is or shall be entitled to bring any action
to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

            (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained to this
Agreement, in the event that after Closing, (i) Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser terminates any employee specified on SCHEDULE 6.9(f) (or any such
employee terminates his or her employment) and Purchaser or its Affiliate pays
such terminated employee severance in connection with such termination in
accordance with the employee's employment agreement in effect as of the Closing,
and (ii) Lee or any Affiliate of Lee hires such terminated employee within two
(2) years




                                      -46-
<PAGE>   48
after such termination, Lee shall promptly reimburse Purchaser or its Affiliate
for the amount of such severance paid by Purchaser or its Affiliate.

      6.10 Interdivisional Agreements. Unless otherwise requested by the
Purchaser in writing, prior to Closing, Lee-NMBC and any Acquired Company shall
terminate, without any continuing Liability to the Lee-NMBC Stations and the
Acquired Companies resulting therefrom, all agreements between any division,
Affiliate or Subsidiary of such company not related to the Lee-NMBC Stations and
the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the division, Affiliate or
Subsidiary of the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company, all of which are
described in SCHEDULE 6.10 hereto.

      6.11 Schedules. Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company shall have the right
from time to time after the date hereof to deliver written updates of the
Schedules attached hereto (the "Schedules") to reflect changes in the business
condition of the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company that occur or arise
after the date hereof until the date of the Closing; provided, however, that
such updates to the Schedules shall reflect matters consistent with the
covenants applicable to Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company pursuant to the terms
hereof. Such updated Schedules shall be promptly furnished to Purchaser.
Purchaser shall have ten (10) days after receipt of each updated Schedule within
which to accept or object to such updated Schedule. In the event Lee-NMBC or any
Acquired Company delivers an updated Schedule to Purchaser prior to the Closing
and Purchaser does not object within ten (10) days after receipt of such update,
the disclosure in such updated Schedule shall be deemed to amend and supplement
the representations and warranties of Lee-NMBC and the Acquired Companies and
the applicable Schedule hereto, and in such event Purchaser shall not have the
right to be indemnified for any matter contained in such updated Schedule. If
Purchaser objects to any updated or revised Schedule, Lee-NMBC or the Acquired
Company shall have thirty (30) days in which to satisfy Purchaser's objection.
If the objection cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days despite good
faith efforts to do so, Lee-NMBC or the Acquired Company shall have a reasonable
period of time necessary to cure the objection. If Lee-NMBC or the Acquired
Company does not cure an objection of Purchaser to a revised or updated
Schedule, and the objection is material to the assets, business, operations,
results of operations or financial condition of any Lee-NMBC Station or Acquired
Company Station, Purchaser may elect to close and pursue the remedies, if any,
under Article 8 of this Agreement or pursue its remedies under Article 9 hereof;
provided that if such objection is not material to the assets, business,
operations, results of operations or a financial condition of any Lee-NMBC
Station or Acquired Company Station, such objection shall not relieve Purchaser
of the obligation to close under this Agreement, but Purchaser shall retain its
rights under Article 8 with respect to such objection if such objection
constitutes a breach of this Agreement by Lee-NMBC. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.11 shall be construed as limiting any party's right to terminate this
Agreement.

      6.12 Retention of and Access to Records. From and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall preserve, in accordance with the normal document retention
policy of the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company, all books and records
transferred by Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall deliver a copy of all books and records of Lee-NMBC




                                      -47-
<PAGE>   49
relating to the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company in the possession of
Purchaser pursuant hereto to Lee in sufficient detail to enable Lee to prepare
Lee's financial statements, the Statement of Closing Adjusted Net Worth of the
Acquired Companies, the Statement of Working Capital of the Lee-NMBC Stations
and all Tax Returns of Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company relating to periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, from and
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall afford to Lee, and its counsel,
accountants and other authorized agents and representatives, during normal
business hours, reasonable access to the employees, books, records and other
data relating to the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company with respect to
periods prior to the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably required by the
requesting party (a) to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final
disposition of any claims which may have been or may be made against any such
party or Person, or its Affiliates, (b) for the preparation of Tax Returns and
audits, and (c) for any other reasonable business purpose.

      6.13  Tax Matters.

            (a) Lee-NMBC will include the income of the Lee-NMBC Stations and
each Acquired Company (pursuant to Section 1502 of the Code ) on Lee's
consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date
and pay any federal income Taxes attributable to such income. The Purchaser
shall cause each Acquired Company to furnish Tax information to Lee for
inclusion in Lee's federal consolidated income Tax Return for the period which
includes the Closing Date in accordance with the Lee-NMBC Stations and each
Acquired Company's past custom and practice. Lee will take no position on such
returns that relate to the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company that
would adversely affect the Lee-NMBC Stations, and each Acquired Company after
the Closing Date except to the extent allowable by Law and consistent with past
custom and practice. The income and any Tax credits of the Lee-NMBC Stations and
each Acquired Company will be apportioned to the period up to and including the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of the
Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company as of the end of the Closing Date.

             (b) All refunds of Taxes (including interest thereon) with respect
to taxable periods of each Acquired Company for which Lee is responsible for the
payment of liabilities for Taxes which are received by each Acquired Company or
credited against liabilities for Taxes of any such Acquired Company for periods
for which Lee is not so responsible (or against any other Liability for which
Lee is not responsible) shall be paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by Purchaser or each Acquired Company (as determined by
Purchaser) to Lee promptly after receipt. Amounts paid pursuant to this Section
6.13(b) shall be treated as additional Stock Purchase Price for the shares of
the Acquired Companies' Common Stock.

            (c) The Purchaser agrees that (i) on the Closing Date, all of the
shares of the Acquired Companies' Common Stock shall be acquired by a domestic
corporation, (ii) such corporation shall not make an election for any Acquired
Company pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code, (iii) Purchaser, not Lee, shall
be responsible for all Taxes arising from any sale or disposition of the assets
of each Acquired Company in any transaction (other than a deemed sale as a
result of the Section 338(h)(10) election referred to in the following clause
(iv)) that is




                                      -48-
<PAGE>   50
consummated after the Closing, and (iv) at the Purchaser's request and within
the time required under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and applicable IRS
regulations, Lee shall make a joint election solely as to KOIN on IRS Form 8023
to enable the Purchaser to receive the benefits afforded under said Section
338(h)(10), provided that the contents of such election shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Lee and Purchaser.

      6.14 Interim Financial Statements. During the period commencing on October
1, 1999 and ending on the Closing Date, Lee shall deliver to the Purchaser, as
soon as practicable after the end of each month in such period, an unaudited
interim consolidated balance sheet of the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired
Company, and an unaudited interim balance sheet of each Lee-NMBC Station and
each Acquired Company Station, as of the end of such month, and the related
consolidated statement of income for the Lee-NMBC Stations and the Acquired
Companies' Stations, and the related statement of income of each Lee-NMBC
Station and each Acquired Company Station, in each case for the portion of the
fiscal year ended as of the end of such month. All such statements shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Financial Statements.

      6.15 Audited Financial Statements. Lee-NMBC recognizes that Purchaser is a
publicly reporting company and agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled at
Purchaser's expense to cause audited and unaudited financial statements of the
Lee-NMBC Stations and the Acquired Companies to be prepared for such periods and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and included in a prospectus
distributed to prospective investors, as required by Law applicable to Purchaser
as a publicly reporting company or registrant. Lee-NMBC agrees to cooperate with
Purchaser and the auditing accountants as reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the preparation and filing of such financial statements,
including providing a customary management representation letter in the form
prescribed by generally accepted auditing standards and shall make a reasonable
request to obtain the consent of Lee-NMBC's independent accounting firm to
permit Purchaser and Purchaser's auditors to have access to such firm's
workpapers.

      6.16 Assignments of Network Affiliation Agreements. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, Lee and the Purchaser shall jointly request and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent,
in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser within its reasonable judgment,
of each broadcast network with which Lee-NMBC or the Acquired Companies has an
Affiliation Agreement to the assignment or transfer of control of such
Affiliation Agreement to the Purchaser, provided that neither Lee nor Purchaser
shall be required to pay or provide material consideration to obtain such
consent. If such written consent from each such broadcast network is not
obtained within sixty (60) days after application therefor, then Purchaser may,
prior to the expiration of such sixty-day period, give notice of election to
terminate this Agreement without further obligation by either party to the
other. If each such consent is not obtained and this Agreement is not
terminated, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived the requirement to secure
any such consent of a broadcast network as a condition precedent to the closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             (a) Any breach of any representation or warranty made by Lee or

                                      -51-
<PAGE>   53
            (c) All Benefit Plans, including but not limited to (i) any claim
arising under any Benefit Plan in connection with termination of any Employee
before, upon or after Closing; (ii) termination of any Benefit Plan, (iii)
termination of any Employee's participation in any Benefit Plan, (iv) withdrawal
of any Acquired Companies from any Benefit Plan, or (v) the obligation under any
Benefit Plan to pay or provide any Employee a bonus, severance, or any other

Agreement; except in each case to the extent included as Acquired Companies
Closing Liabilities, or as liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations in the

Section 2.3(b); or

            (d) All other Excluded Liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations and all
other Acquired Companies Excluded Liabilities.

            8.2 Obligations of Purchaser. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold Lee and NMBC and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and assigns harmless (after
the Closing) from and against any and all Losses of Lee and NMBC, resulting
from, based upon or arising out of, directly or indirectly:

             (a) Any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser
in or pursuant to this Agreement;

            (b) Any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser in this Agreement or other document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement;

             (c) Any Assumed Liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations and any
Acquired Companies Assumed Liabilities; or

            (d) Any Liability to the extent relating to and arising out of the
operation of the Lee-NMBC Stations or any Acquired Company following the
Closing, excluding, however, all Excluded Liabilities of the Lee-NMBC Stations
and all Acquired Companies Excluded Liabilities.

      8.3 Procedure for Indemnification. The procedure for indemnification shall
be as follows:

            (a) The party or parties claiming indemnification (the "Claimant")
shall give written notice to the party from which indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnitor") reasonably promptly after the Claimant learns of any claim or
proceeding covered by the foregoing agreements to indemnify and hold harmless,
but failure to provide prompt notice shall not be deemed to jeopardize
Claimant's right to demand indemnification if Indemnitor is not materially
prejudiced by the delay in receiving notice. If Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced, the Claimant's right to indemnification shall be reduced according
to the extent of the actual Loss or prejudice which Indemnitor can demonstrate
was caused by the delay. Purchaser shall not be deemed to have notice of any
claim or proceeding by reason of any knowledge acquired on or




                                      -52-
<PAGE>   54
before the Closing Date by an Employee, independent contractor or other agent of
any Lee-NMBC Station or Acquired Company.

            (b) With respect to claims between the parties, following receipt of
notice from the Claimant of a claim, the Indemnitor shall have 15 days to make
any investigation of the claim that the Indemnitor deems necessary or desirable,
or such lesser time if a 15 day period would jeopardize any rights of Claimant
to oppose or protest the claim. For the purpose of this investigation, the
Claimant agrees to make available to the Indemnitor and its authorized
representatives the information relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate the
claim. If the Claimant and the Indemnitor cannot agree as to the validity and
amount of the claim within the 15-day period, or lesser period if required by
this Section (or any mutually agreed upon extension hereof) the Claimant may
seek appropriate legal remedies.

            (c) The Indemnitor shall have the right to undertake, by counsel or
other representatives of its own choosing, the defense of such claim. In the
event that the Indemnitor shall elect not to undertake such defense, or within
15 days after notice of such claim from the Claimant shall fail to defend, the
Claimant shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of such claim, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor. Anything in this
Section 8.3 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable
probability that a claim may materially and adversely affect the Claimant other
than as a result of money damages or other money payments, the Claimant shall
have the right, at the reasonable cost and expense of the Indemnitor, to
participate in the defense, compromise or settlement of the claim, (ii) the
Indemnitor shall not, without the Claimant's written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise any claim or consent to entry
of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the plaintiff to the Claimant of a release from all Liability in
respect of such claim, and (iii) in the event that the Indemnitor undertakes
defense of any claim consistent with this Section, the Claimant, by counsel or
other representative of its own choosing and at the reasonable cost and expense
of the Indemnitor, shall have the right to consult with the Indemnitor and its
counsel or other representatives concerning such claim and the Indemnitor and
the Claimant and their respective counsel or other representatives shall
cooperate with respect to such claim. If any disagreement arises in the handling
of the claim, the Indemnitor shall have the right to make the final
determination consistent with the requirements of this Section.

            (d) The Indemnitor and its duly appointed representatives shall have
the sole right to negotiate, resolve, settle or contest any claim for Tax made
by a Tax authority with respect to which the Indemnitor is bound to indemnify
Claimant under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2. If the Indemnitor does not assume the
defense of a claim for the Tax made by a Tax authority with respect to which the
Indemnitor is bound to indemnify a Claimant under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2,
the Claimant may defend the same at the reasonable expense of the Indemnitor (in
accordance with the provisions of Article 8) in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding
with the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld



                                      -53-
<PAGE>   55
            (e) Lee and NMBC waive and release, effective as of the Closing
Date, all claims against any of the Acquired Companies for any Liabilities as of
the Closing not included as Acquired Companies Closing Liabilities, including
any right to contribution or indemnification for any indemnity payments made by
Lee or NMBC after the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

      8.4 Sole Remedy. Each party agrees that the sole Liability and obligations
of the other party and the sole right, remedy and entitlement of each party for
recovery of any monetary claim with respect to or in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
limited to indemnification under this Article 8, and all such parties hereby
waive any and all other statutory and common law rights and remedies (including
without limitation rights of indemnification and contribution) which it has or
may hereafter have, provided such waiver shall in no event be construed to
prevent Purchaser from seeking specific performance or other equitable relief or
remedies.

      8.5   Limitations on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy.

            (a) No claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a) or Section
8.2(a) for breach of any representation or warranty shall be valid unless made
within the applicable Survival Period as defined in Section 8.6.

            (b) No party shall be obligated to indemnify any other party or
parties under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.2(a) unless the Claimant's aggregate
amount of Losses as to which a right of indemnification is provided under
Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.2(a) shall exceed $2,500,000, in which event
$1,250,000 plus all of such Losses above $2,500,000 shall be indemnifiable;
provided that Purchaser's right to recover under Section 8.1(a) for breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 shall not be
subject to such limitation.

            (c) In no event shall the aggregate liability (i) of Lee pursuant to
Section 8.1(a), on the one hand, or of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2(a),
on the other hand, exceed $75,000,000 (provided that Lee's liability for breach
of any representation or warranty contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 shall
not be subject to such limitation); or (ii) of Lee pursuant to Section 8.1(a)
for breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.1, 4.2 or
4.3 and pursuant to Section 8.1(b), (c) and (d), on the one hand, or of the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2(b), (c) or (d), on the other hand, exceed the
sum of the Asset Purchase Price plus the Stock Purchase Price.

            (d) Any Loss relating to any of the Acquired Companies for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall be (i) increased by any
Tax Cost and (ii) reduced by any Tax Benefit which the Claimant incurs or
receives prior to or during the Taxable Period in which the corresponding
indemnification payment is received by the Claimant. In addition, if
indemnification under this Agreement results in an increase in the basis of any
asset (other than stock) or increase in the amount of any net operating loss of
the Claimant, the Claimant shall pay the Indemnitor, within ninety (90) days
after the end of each Tax Period, the





                                      -54-
<PAGE>   56
Tax Benefit, if any, realized for such Tax Period by the Claimant that is
attributable to such increase in basis or net operating loss. In the event any
indemnification paid by an Indemnitor is reduced by a Tax Benefit, or the
Claimant pays the Indemnitor the amount of any Tax Benefit, and there is a
subsequent Final Determination denying the Tax Benefit, the Indemnitor shall
promptly reimburse the Claimant for the amount of the Tax Benefit that was
denied. In the event any indemnification paid by an Indemnitor is increased by a
Tax Cost, or the Claimant receives payment for any Tax Cost, and there is a
subsequent Final Determination reducing the Tax Cost, the Indemnitor shall
promptly be reimbursed by the Claimant for the amount of the Tax Cost that was
reduced. To the extent permitted by law, any indemnity payments made under this
Agreement relating to any of the Acquired Companies shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Stock Purchase Price.

            (e) If any remediation or other work or action is required in order
to correct or cure a violation of any Environmental Law or of any demand (a
"Violation"), Purchaser shall promptly notify Lee-NMBC after acquiring knowledge
of such requirement and shall present a remediation plan to Lee-NMBC at least
twenty (20) days prior to performing such remediation. The remediation plan
shall be designed to minimize the remediation cost to the extent feasible while
providing for a reasonable and customary level of clean-up in compliance with
applicable Law. Lee shall have ten (10) days to review and approve the
remediation plan, the approval of which cannot be unreasonably withheld.

            (f) If Purchaser acquires knowledge prior to Closing that any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Lee-NMBC contained in this
Agreement or any of the Schedules attached hereto has been materially breached,
is materially false or requires material modification or amendment to be
correct, Purchaser shall notify Lee-NMBC within ten (10) days after acquiring
such knowledge. Lee-NMBC shall have up to thirty (30) days to take corrective
action to cure such breach. If Lee-NMBC cannot reasonably cure such breach
within thirty (30) days, despite its good faith efforts, Lee-NMBC shall have
such additional time as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate a cure if such
breach is capable of being cured, but in no event more than an additional sixty
(60) days. If Lee-NMBC fails to cure such a breach, and the breach is material
to the assets, business, operations, results of operations or financial
condition of any Lee-NMBC Station or Acquired Company Station, Purchaser may
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pursue its rights to
indemnification under Article 8 or terminate this Agreement under Article 9.

      8.6 Survival. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.5(f), all
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties made in
this Agreement or any of the Lee Documents shall survive the Closing regardless
of any investigation or inquiry on the part of any party, and the Closing shall
not be deemed a waiver by any party of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of any other party in this Agreement or any of the Lee
Documents; provided, however, that the period of survival shall (i) with respect
to the representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2 and
5.3, continue indefinitely; and (ii) in the case of any other representation and
warranty, end one (1) year after the Closing Date (in each case, the "Survival
Period"). No claim for breach of any representation or warranty may be brought
under this Agreement or any of the Lee Documents unless written notice





                                      -55-
<PAGE>   57
describing in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such claim is given on
or prior to the last day of the applicable Survival Period. In the event such
notice of such a claim is so given, the right to indemnification with respect to
such claim shall survive the applicable Survival Period until the claim is
finally resolved and any obligations with respect to the claim are fully
satisfied. All covenants and agreements under this Agreement or any of the Lee
Documents shall survive the Closing for the applicable statutory limitation
period.

                                   TERMINATION

       9.1  Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:

             (a) By either Lee, acting in its own right or on behalf of NMBC or
each Acquired Company (Lee, together with NMBC and each Acquired Company, "Lee"
for purposes of this Article 9), or the Purchaser at any time prior to the
Closing with the mutual written consent of the other party hereto;

             (b) Unless the Closing has not occurred as a result of a material
breach of this Agreement by the party seeking such termination, by either Lee or
the Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to 5:00 p.m. CST on
the date which is nine (9) months following the date of this Agreement (the
"Termination Date"); provided, however, that either Lee or Purchaser in its sole
discretion may elect to extend the Termination Date until 5:00 p.m. (CST time)
on the date which is one (1) year following the date of this Agreement by
written notice to the other at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the initial
Termination Date; or

             (c) By either Lee or the Purchaser if any Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a final and nonappealable
Governmental Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither Lee nor the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) unless the party seeking to so terminate this
Agreement has used all commercially reasonable best efforts to oppose any such
Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or made
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but nothing
contained in this Section 9.1(c) shall prevent a party that is otherwise
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(d) from
doing so;

             (d) If the Closing has not occurred, by either Lee or the
Purchaser, if not then in material breach of this Agreement, if the other party
has continued in material breach of this Agreement for thirty (30) days after
receipt of written notice of such breach from the terminating party, and such
breach is not cured within such thirty (30) day period provided, however, that
if a party has undertaken but is not able to cure such breach within thirty (30)
days, despite its good faith efforts, the party shall have such additional time
as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate a cure if such breach is capable of
being cured, but in no event more than an additional sixty (60) days; or



                                      -56-
<PAGE>   58
             (e) By Purchaser if entitled to do so under Section 6.11, 6.16 or
8.5(f).


      9.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1 hereof, neither party hereto shall have any further Liability
hereunder except that (i) the provisions of Sections 6.7 and 6.8, and Articles 8
and 9 shall remain in full force and effect, and (ii) each party hereto shall
remain liable to each other party hereto for any breach of its obligations under
this Agreement prior to such termination.

      10.2 Attorneys' Fees and Costs. If any judicial action at law or in
equity, including an action for specific enforcement or declaratory relief, is
brought to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing

<PAGE>   59
attorneys' fees and expenses from the other party, which shall be in addition to
any other relief which may be awarded. For purposes of this section, the
prevailing party shall be the claimant if the claimant is successful in
obtaining substantially all of the relief sought, and shall be the defendant or
respondent if the defendant or respondent is successful in denying substantially
all the relief sought by the claimant.

      10.3 Amendments and Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. The
terms of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument signed by the
party waiving compliance. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or
not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise provided. No delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties hereto may otherwise have
at law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or
on behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this
Section 10.3.

      10.4 Assignment. Except as provided in Section 6.1(c), neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by Lee-NMBC or the Purchaser without the prior written
consent of the other party and any purported assignment or delegation in
violation hereof shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
Lee-NMBC shall be entitled after the Closing Date to assign its obligations
under this Agreement to another entity which succeeds to all or substantially
all of such company's assets and properties, whether by sale, merger,
consolidation, liquidation or otherwise, provided that (i) such successor
assumes and agrees to perform all of Lee-NMBC's obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to an assumption agreement satisfactory to Purchaser within its
reasonable judgment, and (ii) the successor to Lee or NMBC shall remain liable
for the performance and observance of all such obligations; (b) Purchaser may
assign its rights under this Agreement as collateral security to any lender
providing financing to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; provided that no such

      10.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the related documents contained as Exhibits and Schedules hereto or expressly
contemplated hereby (including Lee Documents) contain the entire understanding
of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings
relating to the subject matter hereof. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference into and made a part of this
Agreement for all purposes.

      10.6 Representations and Warranties Complete. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the Lee
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute all the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto and their respective
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors (including
financial, legal and accounting), agents and representatives and upon which the
parties have relied.

      10.7 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is made for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto, their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any third party beneficiary right or any
other legal or equitable rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

      10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Illinois,
without giving effect to any conflicts of law rule or principle that might
require the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

      10.9 Neutral Construction. The parties to this Agreement agree that this
Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms' length and that the final
terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties' negotiations. Each party
represents and warrants that it has sought and received legal counsel of its own
choosing with regard to the contents of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations affected hereby. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them, and that the provisions
of this Agreement therefore should not be construed against a party or parties
on the grounds that the party or parties drafted or was more responsible for
drafting the provision(s).

      10.10 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions or
parts of a provision contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
or part of a provision of this Agreement or any other jurisdiction, but this
Agreement shall be reformed and construed in any such jurisdiction as if such
invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision or part of a provision had never
been contained



                                      -59-
<PAGE>   61
herein and such provision or part shall be reformed so that it would be valid,
legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted in such jurisdiction.

      10.11 Bulk Sales Laws. The parties hereby waive compliance with the bulk
sales or transfer Laws of any state in which the Purchased Assets of the
Lee-NMBC Stations are located or in which operations relating to the Lee-NMBC
Stations or Acquired Stations are conducted.

      10.12 Headings; Interpretation; Schedules and Exhibits.

            (a) The descriptive headings of the several Articles and Sections of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of
this Agreement. References to Sections or Articles, unless otherwise indicated,
are references to Sections and Articles of this Agreement. The word "including"
means including without limitation. Words (including defined terms) in the
singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one
gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires. The
terms " hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all of the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. It is understood and
agreed that neither the specifications of any dollar amount in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules or Exhibits is intended
to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of such item in the
Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes
hereof.

            (b) Whenever Lee-NMBC or each Acquired Company is called upon to
list any contracts or agreements, there shall be deemed excluded from the
applicable representation or warranty any agreement where the primary
obligations of all the parties thereto have been performed or will be performed
before the Closing Date.

            (c) Certain matters and items disclosed in any Schedule or Exhibit
may not be required to be disclosed therein, but may be disclosed therein for
informational purposes only, and no such disclosure shall constitute an
indication or admission of the materiality thereof or create a standard of
disclosure.

            (d) If any fact or item is included on a Schedule referenced by a
particular section in this Agreement and the existence of the fact or item or
its contents is relevant to any other section in this Agreement, the fact or
item shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to such other section whether
or not an explicit cross-reference appears in the Schedules if such relevance is
readily apparent from examination of the Schedules.

      10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. Signatures to faxed copies of this



                                      -60-
<PAGE>   62
Agreement shall be binding so long as original counterparts thereof are provided
to the other party via overnight delivery service received within three (3)
business days thereafter.

      10.14 Cooperation. From and after the Closing, Purchaser will cooperate
with Lee-NMBC in the investigation defense or prosecution of any Action which is
pending or threatened against such company or any of its Affiliates and which
relates to the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company, whether or not any
party has notified the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such
matter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser will make
available its employees employed by the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired
Company to give depositions or testimony and will furnish all documentary or
other evidence in each case as Lee may reasonably request. Lee-NMBC shall
reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Section 10.14.

      10.15 Insurance. Purchaser acknowledges that all insurance policies
maintained by Lee-NMBC and each Acquired Company and its Affiliates with respect
to the Lee-NMBC Stations and each Acquired Company and Purchased Assets of
Lee-NMBC Stations will be terminated effective on the Closing Date.

      10.16 Joint and Several Liability. Lee and NMBC shall be jointly and
severally liable for each representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
liability or obligation of both or either of them under this Agreement or any of
the Lee Documents whether or not so indicated in any other provision of this
Agreement or in any of the Lee Documents.

      10.17 Specific Performance. Lee and NMBC acknowledge that each of the
Lee-NMBC Stations and the Acquired Companies' Stations is of a special, unique
and extraordinary character, and that damages alone are an inadequate remedy for
a breach of this Agreement by Lee-NMBC. Accordingly, as an alternative to
termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1, if Purchaser is not then in
material default hereunder, Purchaser shall be entitled, in the event of
Lee-NMBC's breach, to enforcement of this Agreement (subject to obtaining any
required approval of the FCC or under the HSR Act) by a decree of specific
performance or injunctive relief requiring Lee-NMBC to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement. Such right of specific performance or injunctive relief
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, Purchaser's right to recover
damages and to pursue any other remedies available to Purchaser for Lee-NMBC's
breach. In any action to specifically enforce Lee-NMBC's obligation to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Lee-NMBC shall waive the defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law or in equity and agrees that Purchaser
shall be entitled to obtain specific performance of Lee-NMBC's obligation to
close without being required to prove actual damages. As a condition to seeking
specific performance, Purchaser shall not be required to tender the Cash Payment
but shall be required to demonstrate that Purchaser is ready, willing and able
to tender the Cash Payment as prescribed in this Agreement.
