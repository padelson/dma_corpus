    SALE AND PURCHASE; LOCK-UP; TERMINATION OF OASIS STOCK OPTIONS; GRANT OF
               SMSC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND CASH BONUS AWARDS
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

               SECTION 2.1 Sale and Purchase.

               (a)  Upon  the  terms  and  subject  to the  conditions  of  this
Agreement,  each of the  Shareholders  hereby  sells,  and shall at Closing  (as
defined) transfer to SMSC Germany, and SMSC Germany hereby purchases,  and shall

               (c) The Shareholders  hereby approve the sale and transfer of the
OASIS  Shares to SMSC Germany and  expressly  and  irrevocably  waive all Liens,
preemptive rights,  rights of first refusal,  call options,  put options,  bring
along rights, liquidation preference rights or similar rights they may have with
respect to any or all of the OASIS Shares under the articles of  association  of
any of the  Companies,  under  the  Shareholders'  Agreement,  under  any  other
agreement  or by law  with  respect  to  this  Agreement  and  the  transactions
contemplated  hereunder.  The waiver pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
subject to the condition subsequent (auflosende Bedingung) that the Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 5.3(a) or otherwise.

               SECTION 2.2 Purchase Price.

               The aggregate purchase price (the "Total Purchase Price") for the
OASIS Shares shall consist of (i) initial  consideration in the aggregate amount
of U.S.  Dollars ("USD")  112,831,511 (in words:  one hundred and twelve million
eight hundred and thirty-one thousand five hundred and eleven U.S. Dollars) (the
"Initial   Consideration"),   (ii)  contingent  consideration  (the  "Contingent
Consideration")  in the  aggregate  amount of up to USD  20,000,000  (in  words:
twenty million U.S.  Dollars) and (iii) an amount of USD 172,619 payable by SMSC
Germany to OASIS in accordance with Section 5.2(j). The Contingent Consideration
shall be subject to the  achievement  of certain  performance  goals pursuant to
Section 4.1 in connection  with Exhibit 4.1. The Initial  Consideration  and the
Contingent   Consideration   shall  be  paid   partially   in  cash  (the  "Cash
Consideration") and partially by the issuance and delivery of shares (the "Share
Consideration")  of SMSC  common  stock,  par value  USD 0.10 per  share  ("SMSC
Shares"),  credited  as fully paid and  ranking  equally  with all other  shares
issued in the capital of SMSC (the "Consideration Shares").

               SECTION 2.3 Lock-up.

               During  a   lock-up   period   applicable   to  a   Shareholder's
Consideration  Shares in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and Section 4.2(b) (each
such  period,  a  "Lock-up  Period"),  such  Shareholder  may not,  directly  or
indirectly,  (i) sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or
(ii) engage in short sales,  derivative  transactions,  hedging  transactions or
other transactions or arrangements having the purpose or effect of reducing such
Shareholder's  economic risk of holding,  such Consideration Shares, or agree to
do any of the foregoing ("Lock-up").  It is expressly understood and agreed that
the foregoing shall preclude any transaction  which reasonably could be expected
to  result  in or lead to a sale  or  other  disposition  by a  third  party  of
beneficial interests in such Shareholder's  Consideration  Shares. It is further
expressly  understood  and agreed  that the  foregoing  shall not  preclude  any
Shareholder  from engaging in pure  currency  hedging  transactions  that do not
involve  or  affect  the  Consideration  Shares  in  any  way  whatsoever.  Each
Shareholder agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer  instructions with
SMSC's transfer agent and registrar  against the transfer of such  Shareholder's
Consideration Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

               SECTION 2.4 Share Certificates.

               Certificates   representing   Consideration   Shares  shall  bear
customary  restrictive legends evidencing the restrictions  contained in Section
2.3 of this Agreement as well as any restrictions  arising under U.S. securities
laws.  Any  certificate  held by a  Shareholder  shall,  at the  request of such
Shareholder,  be  exchanged  for a  certificate  without such legends if, in the
reasonable  opinion of counsel to SMSC, all applicable  restrictions have ceased
to apply and the  Consideration  Shares  represented by such  certificate may be
sold and  transferred  freely without  limitation.  SMSC  acknowledges  that the
Shareholders  may wish to  dispose  of all or part of the  Consideration  Shares
immediately  following the end of the  applicable  Lock-up  Period or such later
time as any applicable  transfer  restrictions under U.S.  securities laws shall
terminate.  Accordingly,  if requested by any  Shareholder a reasonable  time in
advance of the end of such period or such later date,  SMSC will use  reasonable
efforts to arrange for the preparation of unlegended  certificates in respect of
such Shareholder's shares in time to facilitate such disposal.  The Shareholders
acknowledge  that SMSC will not apply  for,  and will not bear the cost of,  the
registration of the Consideration Shares.

               SECTION 2.5 Taxes.

               Each of the  Shareholders  shall be responsible for all Taxes (as
defined) and duties,  brokerage fees and all other costs and expenses in respect
of any subsequent dealings in the Consideration Shares issued to him pursuant to
this Agreement.

               SECTION  2.6  Termination  of  OASIS  Stock  Options;   Grant  of
Restricted Stock Awards by SMSC.

entitlements  (the  "Cash  Bonus  Awards")  under  a cash  bonus  agreement,  to
terminate their OASIS Stock Options with effect as of the date hereof and not to
exercise  their OASIS Stock Options  until and  including  the date hereof.  Mr.
Hetzel,  Mr.  Heck,  Mr. Klos,  Mr.  Winkelmann,  Mr.  Buhrer and OSS LLC hereby
undertake vis-a-vis SMSC to use all reasonable efforts to procure that all other
OASIS Optionholders enter into termination agreements  substantially in the form

hereof.  The Restricted  Stock Awards shall be issued as of Closing and shall be
evidenced by the 2005  Restricted  Stock Bonus  Agreements to be entered into by
SMSC and the relevant OASIS Optionholders  within thirty (30) days following the
Closing. The Restricted Stock Awards and the Cash Bonus Awards were allocated in
mutual  agreement  between SMSC and the senior  management of OASIS to the OASIS
Optionholders and certain other members of the Staff of any of the Companies and
shall be subject to a Lock-up  Period of three (3) years  commencing on the date
hereof,  with 25% vesting on the first  anniversary of such date, 25% vesting on
the second anniversary of such date, and 50% vesting on the third anniversary of

attached hereto as Exhibit 2.6(b)(i).  A sample cash bonus agreement is attached
hereto as Exhibit 2.6(b)(ii).

               SECTION 2.7 Issuance of SMSC Stock Options.

               (a) SMSC shall grant  1,100,000  employee  stock options for SMSC
Shares (the "SMSC Stock Options") as of Closing,  which were allocated in mutual
agreement  between  SMSC and  senior  management  of OASIS  and form part of the
relevant  employment or service  agreements  with members of the Staff of any of
the Companies.  The SMSC Stock Options shall be issued under the 2005 Inducement
Stock Option and Restricted  Stock Plan and shall vest over a period of five (5)
years commencing on the date of their issuance,  with 20% vesting each year. The
SMSC Stock Options  shall be evidenced by stock option  agreements to be entered
into by SMSC and the relevant  members of Staff  referred to above within thirty
(30) days following the Closing.

               (b) The  terms  and  conditions  of the SMSC  Stock  Options  are
attached hereto as Exhibit 2.7(b).

               SECTION 4.2 Allocation of Contingent Consideration.

               (a) Of the  Contingent  Consideration  payable  pursuant  to this

               (b) The number of Consideration Shares to be issued and delivered
to each Earn-Out Shareholder as part of the Contingent  Consideration payable to
such Earn-Out  Shareholder shall be calculated by dividing the USD amount of the
Share Consideration forming part of the portion of the Contingent  Consideration
payable  to such  Earn-Out  Shareholder  as set forth in  Section  4.2(a) by the
weighted  average daily closing price of the SMSC Shares on the NASDAQ  National
Market for the thirty (30) Trading Days ending on (and  including)  the Earn-Out
Date.  The  Consideration  Shares paid as part of the  Contingent  Consideration
shall be  subject  to a Lock-up  Period of three  (3)  years  commencing  on the
Earn-Out Date, with one third of such Consideration  Shares being  automatically
released  from the  Lock-up  under this  Section  4.2(b) at the end of each such
year.

               SECTION 4.3 Earn-Out Calculation.

                       balance  sheet  (Konzernbilanz)  as of February 28, 2006,
                       24:00  hours (the  "Earn-Out  Date")  and a  consolidated
                       profit-and-loss     statement     (Konzerngewinn-     und
                       Verlustrechnung)  for the period  beginning March 1, 2005
                       and ending on the Earn-Out Date (the "Earn-Out  Period");
                       and

               (ii)    a calculation  of the Earn-Out  Revenues (as defined) and
                       the Earn-Out Gross Margin (as defined),  a  determination
                       of the  extent to which the  Earn-Out  Targets  have been
                       achieved  and  a   calculation   of  the  amount  of  the
                       Contingent Consideration due to each Earn-Out Shareholder
                       on the  basis of the  Earn-Out  Accounts  (the  "Earn-Out
                       Calculation").

               (b) The Earn-Out  Accounts shall be prepared by SMSC and shall be
audited by SMSC's auditor.  The Earn-Out  Calculation  shall be prepared by SMSC
and shall be reviewed by SMSC's auditor. The Earn-Out Accounts shall be prepared
in  accordance  with the  applicable  generally  accepted  accounting  rules and
principles (Grundsatze  ordnungsgema(beta)er Buchfuhrung und Rechnungslegung) in
Germany  ("German GAAP") in a manner  consistent both in form and substance with
the Financial  Statements (as defined) and the Management Accounts (as defined).
In  particular,   the  same   consolidation   principles,   capitalization   and
depreciation methods,  election rights, valuation principles (in particular with
regard to  inventory)  and the same line items  shall be applied and used in the
Earn-Out  Accounts as were applied and used in the  preparation of the Financial
Statements and the Management  Accounts,  in each case to the extent they are in
accordance  with  German  GAAP.  If the  principles  set forth in the  preceding
sentences  are not  applicable  to a  particular  matter,  such matter  shall be
accounted for in accordance with German GAAP applicable to companies like OASIS.
For  the  purposes  of the  preparation  of the  Earn-Out  Accounts,  all  sales
(Umsatzerlose)  generated  by SMSC or any  Affiliates  of SMSC during the period
from March 1, 2005 to  February  28,  2006 which  relate to the  business of the
OASIS Group as currently  envisaged  under its business plan attached  hereto as
Exhibit  4.3(b) shall be deemed to have been  generated by OASIS.  The costs and
expenses of the audit of the  Earn-Out  Accounts  and the review of the Earn-Out
Calculation shall be solely borne by SMSC.

               (c)  The  Earn-Out   Shareholders  hereby  acknowledge  that  the
Earn-Out  Accounts  and the Earn-Out  Calculation  and all  information  related
thereto constitute "Business Information" within the meaning of Section 9.3(b).

               (d) The  audited  Earn-Out  Accounts  and the  reviewed  Earn-Out
Calculation  shall be final and binding on the Earn-Out  Shareholders,  SMSC and
SMSC Germany for the determination of the amount of the Contingent Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 4.1, unless any of the Earn-Out  Shareholders within
a period of three (3) months after submission of the audited  Earn-Out  Accounts
and the  reviewed  Earn-Out  Calculation  pursuant  to  Section  4.3(a)  files a
statement of claim with the  competent  arbitration  organization  in accordance
with  Article 11 (i)  requesting  payment  from SMSC and/or  SMSC  Germany of an
amount of  Contingent  Consideration  which is higher  than the  amount  payable
pursuant to the audited Earn-Out Accounts and the reviewed Earn-Out  Calculation
and (ii)  alleging  that the  audited  Earn-Out  Accounts  and/or  the  reviewed
Earn-out Calculation do not comply with the rules, principles and procedures set
forth in Section 4.3(b).

               SECTION 4.4 Payment Date.

               If  pursuant  to  the   Earn-Out   Calculation   any   Contingent
Consideration is payable to the Earn-Out Shareholders in accordance with Section

the  Earn-Out  Shareholders  in  accordance  with  Section  4.2  within ten (10)
Business Days (as defined) following April 30, 2006.

agreements  and no  notice  of  termination  with  respect  to any of the  lease
agreements listed in Exhibit 6.7(b)(i) has been served on any of the Companies.

are valid and enforceable, except as otherwise indicated therein. The Companies'
use of the Licensed Intellectual Property under the agreements listed in Exhibit
6.9(c) is in  accordance  with such  agreements.  This  Section  6.9(c) does not
contain  any  warranties  with  regard to the  infringement  of any third  party

confidentiality  obligations on such third parties;  and (ii) the Companies have
issued  reasonable  instructions  to  their  members  of the  Staff  in order to

Companies' rights with respect to, any of the Owned Intellectual Property listed
in Exhibit  6.9(a) or any material  unregistered  Copyrights  that are comprised

relating to such Owned Intellectual  Property,  and (y) to the best knowledge of
the Representing Shareholder,  any such assertion or claim explicitly other than

inventions,  the Companies  have  undertaken  the necessary  steps to either (i)
become, and have become, the sole and exclusive owner of such inventions and all
Patents  related  thereto or (ii)  acquire the  exclusive  right to exercise all
economic rights in such inventions and all Patents related  thereto.  Except for
the persons set out in Exhibit 6.9(g),  there are no further persons  (including
members  of  Staff of any of the  Companies,  independent  contractors,  agents,
consultants  or other third  parties)  who have  contributed  to the  inventions
covered by Patents listed in Exhibit  6.9(a).  To the extent any Software listed
in  Exhibit  6.9(a)  or other  material  Owned  Intellectual  Property  has been
developed by any member of the Staff of any of the Companies in the execution of
his or her  respective  duties and/or  following the  instructions  given by the

rights or (to the extent these rights are  non-assignable  under the  applicable
statutory law) has acquired the exclusive  right to exercise all economic rights
(alle vermogensrechtlichen  Befugnisse) in such Software or other material Owned
Intellectual  Property.  As far as  Software  listed in Exhibit  6.9(a) or other
material Owned  Intellectual  Property was created by  independent  contractors,
agents, consultants or other third parties for the Companies, the Companies have
secured  valid  assignments  of the  legal  rights  or  otherwise  acquired  the
exclusive  right to  exercise  all  economic  rights in such  Software  or other
material Owned Intellectual  Property. In case Intellectual Property is co-owned
by any of the  Companies,  the  foregoing  applies in  relation  to the  partial
ownership interest of the respective Company only.

               (h) Except as set out in Exhibit  6.9(h),  the  Companies are not
under any obligation to pay  compensation to any current or former member of the
Staff of any of the Companies under the German Employee Invention Act. Except as
provided in Exhibit  6.9(h),  no member of the Staff of any of the Companies has
asserted any payment claims in respect of any of the Owned Intellectual Property
in addition to the remuneration expressly agreed in the applicable employment or
service  contract  and, as of the date hereof,  no member of the Staff of any of
the Companies is entitled to any such additional payment claim.

               (i) Except as disclosed in Exhibit 6.9(i),  to the best knowledge
of  the  Representing  Shareholder,  neither  the  use  or  exploitation  of any

claim  and  there has been no  written  assertion  or claim in the last five (5)
years  that  any  of the  Companies'  use or  exploitation  of any  Intellectual
Property  or the  conduct  or  operations  of the  business  of the OASIS  Group
infringes  upon or  violates in any way the  Intellectual  Property of any third
party.  None of the  Companies is, or within the last five (5) years has been, a
party  to any  litigation  or  other  proceeding,  which  involves  a  claim  of
infringement of any Intellectual  Property of any person.  To the best knowledge
of the Representing Shareholder,  no such assertion or claim has been explicitly
made other than in writing in the last five (5) years and no such  litigation or
other proceeding has been explicitly threatened in the last five (5) years other

as provided in Exhibit 6.9(i) there are no  infringements  by any third party of
any material Owned  Intellectual  Property or any breaches by any third party of
any  licenses or other  agreements  involving  any material  Owned  Intellectual
Property.

               (j) None of the Companies  has given or received  within the last
three (3) years any  written  notice of default  or of any event  which with the
lapse of time would constitute a default under any material  agreement  relating
to the Company IP, and, to the best knowledge of the  Representing  Shareholder,
no such notice has been  explicitly  given or received  orally during such time.
None of the  Companies  is in  default  with  regard to any  material  agreement
relating  to the Company IP,  nor,  to the best  knowledge  of the  Representing
Shareholder,  is any other person in default  with respect to any such  material
agreement.

               (k)  Each of the  Companies  has  taken  reasonable  measures  to
protect  the  confidentiality  of  its  Trade  Secrets,   including  appropriate
confidentiality  obligations  in  agreements  under  which any of the  Companies
licenses or  otherwise  discloses  any of its  material  Trade  Secrets to third
parties.  Except for those Trade Secrets used pursuant to the agreements  listed
in Exhibit  6.9(c),  none of the Companies is restricted by license  agreements,

any third party,  (ii) license or transfer its material  Trade  Secrets to third
parties or (iii) otherwise use any of its material Trade Secrets.  Except as set
forth in Exhibit  6.9(c) there are no  agreements  in which any of the Companies

Representing Shareholder, none of the Companies is currently misappropriating or
misusing or has in the past five (5) years  misappropriated or misused any third
party Trade Secrets.  Within the last five (5) years,  none of the Companies has
received any written assertion or claim alleging any  misappropriation or misuse
of third party Trade Secrets by any of the Companies,  and to the best knowledge
of the  Representing  Shareholder,  within the last five (5) years,  none of the
Companies  has received any such  assertion  or claim  explicitly  other than in
writing. To the best knowledge of the Representing  Shareholder,  no third party
is  misappropriating or misusing any of the Companies' material Trade Secrets or
violating any  confidentiality  obligation it may have with regard to any of the
Companies' material Trade Secrets.

Companies)  which  are  still  outstanding  and,  to the best  knowledge  of the
Representing  Shareholder,  there has been no  guarantee  or  security  interest

Agreement  I  and  Termination  Agreement  II  and  except  for  the  employment

6.17(d) of this Agreement, except for immaterial amendments to any such plans or
programs  that will not result in an increase in the annual  costs in respect of

terminated.

               (j) None of the Non-US  Companies  has made any still  applicable
undertakings  in connection  with any  collective  dismissal of employees of the

               SECTION 6.18 US Labor Matters.

               (a) The Employee  Data Package  provided by the  Shareholders  to
SMSC prior to the date hereof  sets forth a complete  and  accurate  list of all
Staff of all Companies,  containing for each member of the Staff of INC complete

               (b) Exhibit  6.18(b) sets forth a complete and accurate list with
respect to INC of:

               (i)     each  employment,  severance,  separation,   termination,

                       change-of-control,  retention or other agreement, policy,
                       arrangement or  understanding  between INC and any of the
                       members of Staff of INC, independent contractors,  former
                       members  of  Staff  of INC  (solely  in the  case of such
                       former  members  of Staff of INC,  only to the extent INC
                       has any  obligation or liability  that has not been fully
                       discharged  or  terminated)  as well  as any  outstanding
                       offers of employment made by INC;

               (ii)    deferred  compensation,  profit  sharing,  gain  sharing,

                       executive perquisites,  executive supplemental retirement
                       or any other  long-term  incentive  or equity based plan,
                       policy or agreement (such as stock appreciation rights or
                       phantom stock,  incentive and company savings schemes) to
                       which INC is a party; and

               (iii)   any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
                       the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
                       as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not subject to ERISA, or
                       any undertakings in connection with pension,  retirement,
                       early retirement or health  insurance  plans,  insofar as
                       the  Staff  of INC  concerned  are  entitled  to  receive
                       advantages in addition to those provided for by law

               (collectively referred to as "Company Plans").

               (c)  The  Employee  Data  Package  contains  true,  complete  and
accurate  copies  of (i) the  Company  Plans  (and,  if  applicable,  the  trust
agreements or other funding  arrangements)  and all  amendments  thereto and any
written  interpretations  thereof  (or,  with  respect to any such  amendment or
interpretation  that is not in writing,  a written  description  of the material
terms thereof);  (ii) the summary plan descriptions of such Company Plans, (iii)
the most  recent  determination  letter,  if any, of the U.S.  Internal  Revenue
Service  relating to each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section  401(a)
of the U.S.  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and no event
or condition  has occurred or exists since the date of such letter that could be
reasonably expected to result in disqualification of any such Company Plan; (iv)
the most recent Internal  Revenue Service Form 5500 filing,  if applicable;  (v)
the most recent  financial  statement,  if applicable;  and (vi) the most recent
actuarial report, if applicable. Each Company Plan has been administered in, and
is in,  compliance  with its terms and with the  requirements of applicable law,
including ERISA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended,  the Health Insurance  Portability and  Accountability  Act of 1996, as
amended,  and the Code,  except for any failures to be in such  compliance  that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to result in a
materi al liability to INC.

               (d)  Neither  INC nor  any  trade  or  business,  whether  or not
incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"),  which together with INC would be deemed to
be a "single  employer"  within the  meaning of  Section  4001(b) of ERISA,  has
incurred any liability  pursuant to Title I or Title IV of ERISA or the penalty,
excise tax or joint and several  liability  provisions  of the Code  relating to
employee  benefit  plans and no condition  exists that presents a risk to INC or
any ERISA Affiliate of INC of incurring any such liability (other than liability
for benefits or premiums  payable to the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation
("PBGC") arising in the ordinary course that are not yet due), or after the date
hereof,  SMSC or any of its  Affiliates.  Neither INC nor any ERISA Affiliate of
INC  contributes or has ever been required to contribute to any  "multi-employer
plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.  There are no Company Plans that are
"employee  pension  benefit  plans" (as defined in Section  3(2) of ERISA) as to
which INC may  incur any  liability  under  Section  302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code.

               (e) With respect to each  Company  Plan that is a "welfare  plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),  INC has no obligation to provide health,
life  insurance,  or death  benefits  (whether or not  insured)  with respect to
current or former members of Staff of INC after retirement or other  termination
of  employment  or service,  other than as required  under  Section 4980B of the
Code,  and each such  Company  Plan may be  amended  or  terminated  at any time
without incurring liability thereunder.

               (f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  either  alone  or in
combination  with another  event  (whether  contingent  or  otherwise)  will (i)
entitle  any  current  or  former  member of Staff or  consultant  of INC to any
increased  or  modified  benefit  or  payment;   (ii)  increase  the  amount  of
compensation due to any such member of Staff of INC,  independent  contractor or
consultant;   (iii)   accelerate   the  vesting,   payment  or  funding  of  any
compensation,  stock-based benefit,  incentive or other benefit;  (iv) result in
any  "parachute  payment"  under  Section 280G of the Code  (whether or not such
payment is considered to be reasonable  compensation for services rendered);  or
(v) cause any  compensation to fail to be deductible under Section 162(m) or any
other provision of the Code.

               (g) INC has not  officially  notified the Staff of INC in writing
or otherwise  of any intent or  commitment  (whether or not legally  binding) to
create or implement any additional  employee benefit plan or to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Plan, except for immaterial amendments to any Company Plan
that will not result in a material  increase  in the annual  costs in respect of
such plan incurred or to be incurred by INC.

               (h) Neither is INC subject to  collective  bargaining  agreements
with unions nor are such agreements  currently negotiated by INC. As of the date
hereof,  there is no general  labor  dispute,  strike or work  stoppage or other
concerted labor activity against INC pending or, to the best of the Representing
Shareholder's knowledge,  threatened.  The Representing Shareholder is not aware
of any existing or imminent  general labor  disputes  involving the employees of
INC's main suppliers which may significantly  affect INC's financial or economic
situation and prospects.

               (i) INC is now and has  been  in the  past in  compliance  in all
material  respects with all  individual  employment,  independent  contractor or
consultant agreements and applicable labor laws.

               (j) None of the  employees  specified as "key  employees"  in the
Employee  Data Package who are in  employment or service with INC as of the date
hereof  has  resigned,  or made  known  his or her  intention  to  resign to the
management of INC, within the six months preceding such date.

               (k) The accruals for obligations of INC under any Company Plan or
benefits  granted to  individual  members of Staff of INC and former  members of
Staff of INC reflected on the Financial  Statements and Management  Accounts for
fiscal  years 2003 and 2004 were as of December  31, 2003 and December 31, 2004,
respectively,  determined  in  accordance  with US GAAP.  INC has  effected  all
increases in pension, survivor, disability and medical care benefits as required
under applicable laws and regulations.

               (l) All  present  members  of  Staff  of INC  have  executed  the
proprietary information agreement set forth in Exhibit 6.18(l).

               (m) All members of the Staff of INC have acknowledged receipt and
agreement with the current employee handbook in their respective locations.

               (n) INC  complies  and has  complied in the past with the Federal
Family  Medical  Leave  Act  and  its  rules  and  regulations  relating  to the
facilities  and employees of INC. None of the members of the Staff of INC are on
disability leave.

               (o) With respect to any Company Plan,  within the past five years
INC:

               (i)     has not  materially  reduced or  restricted  any employee
                       benefits or terminated any Company Plan; and

               (ii)    has made all  contributions  or premium  payments  to the
                       extent  legally   (i.e.,   by  statute  or  by  contract)
                       required.

               (p)  There  are no  pending,  or to  the  best  knowledge  of the
Representing Shareholder threatened, complaints, investigations or law suits, in
each case regarding alleged breaches of applicable laws or regulations,  against
INC relating to any unfair labor practice, employment or human resources related
issues,  including  benefits,  employment,  wages,  compensation,   termination,
discrimination and safety, by any individual,  governmental authority or private
agency,  and there were no such complaints,  investigations  or law suits in the
past five years.

               (q) INC has  verified  the  U.S.  employment  eligibility  of all
members of the Staff  employed by INC in  accordance  with the  Immigration  and
Nationality Act of 1952 and the  Immigration  Reform and Control Act of 1986. No
members of the Staff employed by INC who are  authorized  for  employment  under
non-immigrant  employment visas are out of status,  have been out of status,  or
are at imminent risk of being out of status.

               (r) Except as otherwise  disclosed by the Shareholders to SMSC in
writing prior to the date hereof,  INC has no leased  employees,  consultants or
independent  contractors,  and  there  are no  complaints,  actions,  claims  or
proceedings  pending or, to the best knowledge of the Representing  Shareholder,
threatened  to be  brought,  by any  such  person  or any  governmental  body to
reclassify  such leased  employee,  consultant  or  independent  contractor as a
regular employee of INC.

6.20(b),  such  declarations,  notices,  returns and reports  are  complete  and
correct,  except for the  recording  of the tax book values of OASIS in INC and,
possibly,  in OSS.  Except  for VAT,  none of the  Companies  is  currently  the
beneficiary of any extension of time to file any Tax or Tax-related return. None

Any shares of OASIS in INC are recorded in the draft  restated tax balance sheet
of OASIS as of December 31, 2000,  which is attached hereto as Exhibit  6.20(h),
at a value equal to their fair market value  (Teilwert) as of December 14, 2000,
and, for the purpose of a restructuring  following the date hereof and involving
the sale or contribution of the shares in INC to a U.S.  entity,  such value, as
set forth on Exhibit 6.20(h), has to be recognized by the German Tax authorities
as the correct value under currently  applicable tax laws and regulations  after

in Exhibit 6.20(h).

               SECTION 6.21 Litigation.

Agreement, or the performance of the transaction contemplated hereby.

               SECTION 6.25 Private Placement of Consideration Shares.

               To the extent a Representing  Shareholder receives  Consideration
Shares,  such  Representing  Shareholder is acquiring such shares for investment
purposes and not with a view to  distribution or transfer,  it being  understood

including (a) all annual reports on Form 10-K, (b) all quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, (c) all proxy  statements  relating to meetings of  stockholders  (whether
annual or special),  (d) all material  current  reports on Form 8-K, and (e) all
other material reports,  schedules,  registration  statements or other documents
required to be filed with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC").
All of the  documents  filed by SMSC with the SEC during such period,  including
all exhibits  contained or  incorporated  by reference in such  documents and as
amended to date, are  collectively  referred to as the "SMSC Reports".  The SMSC
Reports (i) have been prepared in all material  respects in accordance  with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the U.S.  Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as  amended,  as the case may be,  and (ii) did not at the time they were  filed
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein,  in the light of the  circumstances  under  which they were  made,  not
misleading.

               SECTION 7.6 Financial Statements.

               The audited financial  statements and unaudited interim financial
statements  (including  the  related  notes  and  schedules)  of  SMSC  and  its
consolidated  subsidiaries  included or  incorporated  by  reference in the SMSC
Reports  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted   accounting
principles in the United States applied on a consistent basis during the periods
reflected therein and fairly present the consolidated financial position of SMSC
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and its consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in the
case  of  any  unaudited  interim  financial  statements,   to  normal  year-end
adjustments.

               SECTION 7.7 No Material Adverse Change.

               Since  the  date as of  which  information  is  given in the SMSC
Reports,  there has not been any  Material  Adverse  Change,  or, to the best of
SMSC's knowledge, any development which is reasonably likely to cause a Material
Adverse  Change of SMSC and its  subsidiaries  taken as a whole,  other  than as
disclosed in the SMSC Reports.


                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                  ------------

                                INDEMNIFICATION
                                ---------------

               SECTION 8.1 Notification of Claims.

               SMSC shall  notify the  relevant  Shareholder  or the  Management
Shareholders'  Representative (as defined below), as the case may be, in writing
of any claim being  asserted  by SMSC or SMSC  Germany  against any  Shareholder
under or in connection with this Agreement,  describing in reasonable  available
detail the nature of the claim and to the extent  possible a good faith estimate
of the amount involved.

               SECTION 8.2 Cure Period.

               If  any  of  the  representations  and  warranties  contained  in
Sections  6.1 to 6.25 is  partially  or wholly  incorrect,  SMSC shall give each
Representing  Shareholder the opportunity to put, within a period of 30 (thirty)
days after  receipt of the relevant  notification  pursuant to Section 8.1, SMSC
and, at the request of SMSC,  SMSC Germany and/or the  respective  entity of the
OASIS  Group,   in  the  position  in  which  they  would  have  been  had  such
representation and warranty been correct (Naturalrestitution).

               SECTION 8.3 Indemnification by the Shareholders.

               (a)  If  the   Representing   Shareholders   fail  to  cure  such
incorrectness of a representation and warranty in accordance with Section 8.2 or
if such  incorrectness  cannot be cured,  the  Representing  Shareholders  shall
indemnify  (Schadensersatz  leisten)  SMSC and,  at the  request  of SMSC,  SMSC
Germany and/or the respective Company, from and against all costs,  liabilities,
claims,  losses or damages,  including the costs of any settlement in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 8.4,  reasonable legal,  accounting and
experts' fees as well as other consequential and indirect damages (but excluding
lost  profits  (entgangene  Gewinne) and  internal  administrative  and overhead
costs) plus interest thereon from the date on which the indemnification claim is
asserted  in writing at an annual rate equal to the  default  interest  rate set
forth in Section 1.7 (the  "Losses")  resulting  from or arising out of any such
incorrectness and thereby putting SMSC and, at the request of SMSC, SMSC Germany
and/or the respective  entity of the OASIS Group,  in the financial  position in
which they would have been had such  representation  and  warranty  been correct
(Geldersatz).   Such   indemnification   shall  be  irrespective  of  any  fault
(Verschulden) on the part of the Representing Shareholders.  The statutory rules
regarding  mitigation  of damage  (Schadensminderung)  and  set-off of  benefits
(Vorteilsausgleichung)  pursuant to Section 249 et seq. of the German Civil Code
shall apply.

               (b) SMSC's rights to demand indemnification for any incorrectness
of any representation or warranty made by the Representing  Shareholders in this
Agreement  shall  be  excluded  in  case  of  actual  knowledge  of  SMSC or its
representatives or advisors of such  incorrectness at the date hereof.  However,
SMSC's  rights  to  demand  indemnification  shall  not be  excluded  in case of
negligent  or  gross  negligent  ignorance  of  SMSC or its  representatives  or
advisors  that a  representation  or warranty of the  Representing  Shareholders
under this Agreement is not or may not be correct,  even if the underlying facts
of such incorrect  representation or warranty have been disclosed to SMSC or its
representatives  or  advisors.  Section  442(1) 2nd Sentence of the German Civil
Code shall be excluded.

               (c) For the  avoidance of doubt:  (i) only SMSC shall be entitled
to demand indemnification from the Shareholders, and (ii) SMSC shall be entitled
to demand  indemnification  from the  Shareholders  from and  against all Losses
incurred by SMSC, SMSC Germany and/or any of the Companies. If and to the extent
that any of SMSC, SMSC Germany and/or any of the Companies has been  indemnified
from and against any Losses by the  Shareholders,  the same Losses  shall not be
recoverable twice by any of SMSC, SMSC Germany or any of the Companies.

               SECTION 8.4 Third Party Claims.

               In the case of the commencement of any action or proceeding,  the
assertion of any claim or the imposition of any penalty or assessment by a third
party  (including Tax  authorities  and other  governmental  agencies) which may
result in claims being brought against any of the Shareholders  pursuant to this
Agreement (a "Third Party  Claim"),  SMSC shall,  without  undue delay after the
date on which the  Third  Party  Claim  has  arisen,  provide  all  Shareholders
potentially  liable  hereunder  with  respect  to such  Third  Party  Claim (the
"Relevant  Shareholders")  with notice of such Third Party Claim,  together with
copies of all documents  and  information  in  connection  with such Third Party
Claim  reasonably  necessary for the Relevant  Shareholders  to investigate  the
Third Party Claim. SMSC shall defenditself, and shall cause SMSC Germany and the
defendant  of such Third Party Claim to defend  itself  against such Third Party
Claim in accordance with the statutory obligation regarding mitigation of damage
(Schadensminderungspflicht)  (whether or not applicable  under statutory law) to
mitigate  the Losses  payable by the  Relevant  Shareholders  under  Articles VI
and/or VIII with respect to such Third Party Claim. SMSC shall keep the Relevant
Shareholders  (except for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann) fully informed  regarding the
progress of such defense and shall permit the Relevant Shareholders to assist in
the defense of the claim.  Failure by SMSC to comply with its  notification  and
information  obligations  provided  in this  Section  8.4 shall not  relieve the
Relevant Shareholders'  indemnification  obligations under this Agreement if and
to the  extent  that SMSC is able to show that its  failure  has not  materially
prejudiced  SMSC's  or,  as the  case may be,  SMSC  Germany's  or the  relevant
defendant's ability to defend such Third Party Claim.

               SECTION 8.5 Survival of  Representations  and  Warranties  of the
Shareholders.

               Claims based on Articles VI and/or VIII  (excluding  the specific
indemnities pursuant to Sections 8.8, 8.9, 8.10 and 8.11 in respect of which the
limitation  periods set forth in such  Sections  shall  apply)  shall,  unless a
statement  of claim  has  been  filed by SMSC  with  the  competent  arbitration
organization,  become  time-barred  (verjahren)  upon the lapse of eighteen (18)
months  following the date hereof,  except that claims based on or for breach of
the representations and warranties contained in (i) Sections 6.1(d), 6.2 and 6.3
shall become  time-barred  at the close of the tenth (10th)  anniversary  of the
date hereof, (ii) Section 6.9 shall become time-barred at the close of the third
(3rd)  anniversary  of the date  hereof,  and (iii)  Section  6.20 shall  become
time-barred  six  months  after  the date on which  any  relevant  Tax or social
security  insurance   assessment  becomes  final  and  binding.   The  statutory
provisions on the suspension of time-barring (Hemmung der Verjahrung) are hereby
excluded,  except for Sections 204 Nos. 1, 10 and 11 and 205 of the German Civil
Code (and Section 203 of the German Civil Code to the extent applicable pursuant
to Section 10.7(d)).

               SECTION 8.6 Limitations on Shareholders' Liability.

               (a) Without  prejudice to the  following  sentences,  all and any
claims against any Shareholder under Articles VI and/or VIII shall be limited to
a maximum  aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Initial  Consideration  paid to
such Shareholder.  However,  all and any claims against any Shareholder  (except
DEWB) under  Articles VI and/or VIII (other than claims for breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1(a) through (e), 6.2 and
6.3)  shall be  limited  to a  maximum  aggregate  amount  equal to the  Initial
Consideration placed into escrow for the account of such Shareholder pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) and all and any claims against DEWB under Articles VI and/or VIII
(other than claims for breach of any of the  representations  and warranties set
forth in  Sections  6.1(a),  (d) and (e),  6.2 and 6.3)  shall be  limited  to a
maximum  amount  equal  to 25% of the  Initial  Consideration  payable  to  DEWB
pursuant to Section 3.1(a). All and any claims against the relevant Representing
Shareholders for breach of the  representation and warranty set forth in Section
6.20(h) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount of EUR 3,000,000. For the
avoidance  of doubt,  the various  limitations  on  liability  contained in this
Section 8.6 shall,  to the extent  that they are  applicable  to any  particular
claim, apply  concurrently with each other  (nebeneinander) - e.g. a claim for a
breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in Section 6.20(h)
shall count not only  against  the  limitation  on  liability  contained  in the
preceding  sentence  but also  against  those  contained in the first and second
sentences of this Section 8.6.

               (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, for as
long as the Escrow Accounts or Escrow Deposits have not been dissolved,  all and
any claims against any of the Shareholders under Articles VI and/or VIII of this
Agreement  shall be  limited  to a right to the use  (Verwertung)  of the Escrow
Shares or to the release of the Escrow Cash in accordance  with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

               (c) If and to the extent that SMSC has a claim  against more than
one of the  Shareholders  under Articles VI and/or VIII of this  Agreement,  the
liability of each of the relevant Shareholders shall be limited as follows:

               (i)     if all Shareholders are liable for the relevant claim, to
                       a  percentage  of the  amount of the  claim  equal to the
                       Representing  Shareholder's percentage of shareholding in
                       OASIS as shown in Exhibit A;

               (ii)    if  only  Messrs.  Hetzel,  Heck,  Winkelmann,  Klos  and
                       Buhrer,  OSS LLC and DEWB  are  liable  for the  relevant
                       claim,  to the following  percentage of the amount of the
                       claim:

                       Name                         Percentage
                       ====                         ==========

                       DEWB                            33.33%

                       Mr. Patrick Heck                5.02%

                       Mr. Matthias Winkelmann         5.02%

                       Mr. Rainer Klos                 5.02%

                       Mr. Jorg Buhrer                 0.98%;

               (iii)   if only Messrs. Hetzel, Heck, Winkelmann, Klos and Buhrer
                       and OSS LLC are liable  for the  relevant  claim,  to the
                       following percentage of the amount of the claim:

                       Name                         Percentage
                       ====                         ==========

                       OSS LLC                         49.93%

                       Mr. Herbert Hetzel              26.00%

                       Mr. Matthias Winkelmann         7.53%

                       Mr. Rainer Klos                 7.53%

                       Mr. Jorg Buhrer                 1.48%.

               (iv)    in all other cases,  the  individual  claim  against each
                       Shareholder shall be calculated as follows:

                                    Q1
                        Di=Dtx --------------
                               (Q1+Q2+...+Qn)

                       where Di shall be the amount payable by such Shareholder,

                       where Dt shall be the aggregate amount of the Losses,

                       where  Qi  shall   be  the   percentage   equal  to  such
                       Shareholder's  percentage  of  shareholding  in  OASIS as
                       shown in Exhibit A,

                       where Q1+Q2+...+Qn shall be the sum of all percentages of
                       shareholdings  in  OASIS as  shown  in  Exhibit  A of all
                       Shareholders that are liable for the relevant claim.

               (d)  Subject to Section  8.6(f),  SMSC shall only be  entitled to
assert claims against the Shareholders for any incorrectness of a representation
and  warranty  or  pursuant  to Section  8.10 if (i) each  individual  claim for
indemnification against the Shareholders (as a group) exceeds EUR 25,000 (twenty
five  thousand   Euro)  and  (ii)  the  aggregate   amount  of  all  claims  for
indemnification against the Shareholders (as a group) exceeds EUR 700,000 (seven
hundred  thousand  Euro),  in which case the full amount of all  indemnification
claims exceeding EUR 25,000 may be asserted (Freigrenze).  This limitation shall
not  apply  in  respect  of  any  claims  against  the   Shareholders   for  any
incorrectness of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.1(a)
through (e), 6.2, 6.3 and 6.6(e), and, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of
any indemnification claim pursuant to Sections 8.8, 8.9 and 8.11.

               (e)  Subject to Section  8.6(f),  all and any claims  against any
Shareholder under Article VI and/or Article VIII shall be excluded if and to the
extent that

               (i)     in respect of the particular matter of the relevant claim
                       of SMSC a specific  allowance,  provision  or reserve has
                       been  made  in the  Financial  Statements  or  Management
                       Accounts;

               (ii)    the Losses which are the subject  matter of the claims of
                       SMSC have been  recovered  by SMSC,  SMSC  Germany or the
                       relevant Company under any insurance held by any Company;

               (iii)   SMSC, SMSC Germany or the Companies have obtained any Tax
                       benefits  in  (portions  of)  assessment   periods  after
                       December 31, 2004 to the extent they arise as a result of
                       the  incurrence  of any  Taxes  to be  indemnified  under
                       Section 6.20; or

               (iv)    the liability  arises from, or was altered by, changes in
                       circumstances   or   changes   in  the   legal   position
                       (Rechtslage)    (including    changes    in   case    law
                       (Rechtsprechung)      or     administrative      practice
                       (Verwaltungspraxis))   which   occurred  after  the  date
                       hereof.

               (f) None of the exclusions and  limitations  set forth in Section
8.6 (e) shall apply in respect of any claims  against the  Shareholders  for any
incorrectness of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.1(a)
through (e), 6.2 and 6.3 and any indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.9.

               (g) If and to the extent a Party  cannot  bring a claim (i) based
on the  incorrectness  of a specific  representation  and  warranty set forth in
Articles VI or VII which it could have brought had a particular  matter not been
disclosed in an Exhibit  thereto or (ii),  for the  indemnification  pursuant to
Section 8.10,  which it could have brought had the matter not been  disclosed in
Exhibit  6.9(f)  and/or  Exhibit  6.9(i),  such Party may not bring a claim with
regard to the same matter under a more general  representation  and warranty or,
with respect to claims under Section 8.10(a),  under any of the  representations
and warranties (Prinzip des lex specialis derogat legi generali).

               (h) Where a  representation  and  warranty  is  qualified  by the
reference  to the  knowledge  or  best  knowledge  of a  Shareholder,  only  the
Representing Shareholder's actual own knowledge (eigene positive Kenntnis) shall
be relevant;  except that where the  knowledge or best  knowledge  (i) of any of
Messrs.  Hetzel, Heck, Klos,  Winkelmann or Buhrer or OSS LLC is relevant,  they
shall also be deemed not only to have the knowledge  which Mr.  Hetzel  actually
possesses on the date hereof,  but also the  knowledge  that (A) Mr.  Hetzel had
possessed had he exercised the diligence of a prudent  member of the  management
board (Sorgfalt eines ordentlichen und gewissenhaften  Geschaftsleiters)  within
the meaning of Section 93(1) of the German Stock  Corporation  Act, and (B) (but
only for the purposes of Section 6.9) any of Messrs. Heck, Klos, Winkelmann,  Ho
and Knapp actually  possesses on the date hereof;  and (ii) of DEWB is relevant,
DEWB shall also be deemed not only to have the knowledge which Ms. Sabine Ahlers
actually  possesses on the date hereof,  but also the  knowledge  that any other
representative  of DEWB on the supervisory  board of OASIS and/or OSS within the
past five (5) years actually  possessed at the time when he or she were employed
by or member of the  management  of DEWB;  provided that the knowledge of former
representatives  of DEWB on the supervisory board of OASIS and/or OSS who are no
longer  employees of DEWB on the date hereof shall only be attributed to DEWB to
the  extent  it is  documented  in  minutes  of the  supervisory  board or other
documentary records.

               SECTION 8.7 No Joint Liability; No Joint Creditors.

               (a)   The    Shareholders    shall   not   be   jointly    liable
(Gesamtschuldner)   but  only  severally  liable   (Einzelschuldner)  for  their
obligations and liabilities under this Agreement.

               (b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  in  Section  10.7  of this
Agreement, the Shareholders are not joint creditors (Gesamtglaubiger),  but only
several creditors (Einzelglaubiger) in respect of the rights and claims to which
they are entitled under this Agreement.

               SECTION 8.8 Infineon Indemnity.

               (a) The  Shareholders  (except for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann) shall
pay to SMSC  or,  at the  request  of  SMSC,  to SMSC  Germany  or to any of the
Companies,  an amount equal to the Losses  incurred by SMSC, SMSC Germany and/or
any of the  Companies  in  connection  with the current  dispute  with  Infineon
Technologies  AG concerning the OS8300 IC as described in Exhibit  6.21(a).  The
provisions  of Section  8.4 shall  apply with  regard to such  dispute  and SMSC
shall,  and shall  cause SMSC  Germany  and the  Companies  to,  comply with the
statutory  obligation  regarding  mitigation of damage (as if  applicable  under
statutory law) to mitigate the Losses payable by the relevant  Shareholders with
respect to the aforementioned dispute.

               (b) For the avoidance of doubt,  the provisions  contained in the
second  sentence of Section  8.5 and in Section 8.6 shall apply to the  specific
indemnity  pursuant to this  Section 8.8. The  obligations  of the  Shareholders
(except for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann)  pursuant to this  Section 8.8 shall become
time-barred six (6) months after the end of the dispute, whether through a final
court judgment, arbitral award, settlement agreement,  acknowledgment of claims,
withdrawal of the claim brought or otherwise (as evidenced in writing).

               (c) Section 8.3(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis.


               SECTION 8.9 Tax Indemnity.

               (a) The  Shareholders  (except for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann) shall
pay to SMSC or, at the request of SMSC,  to any of the Companies an amount equal
to the amount necessary to indemnify and hold harmless any of the Companies from
and  against  any  liability  of such  Company  for (A) any  Taxes  relating  to
(portions  of) periods  ending on or prior to  December  31,  2004,  and (B) any
Losses (as defined in Section 8.3(a) with the exception of "other  consequential
and indirect damages") relating to such Taxes (including reasonable professional
fees for the  preparation of a transfer  pricing  documentation  incurred in the
course of a Tax audit  relating  to  (portions  of)  periods  ending on or prior
December 31, 2004). However, no such obligation shall exist to the extent that:

               (i)     such Taxes have been  reflected  or  provided  for in the
                       Management Accounts; or

               (ii)    SMSC or the  Companies  have  actually  obtained  any Tax
                       benefit (not  including Tax refunds within the meaning of
                       Section  8.9(e)) after 31 December 2004 which arises from
                       the  adjustment  giving rise to any Tax to be indemnified
                       hereunder; or

               (iii)   such Taxes result from a  restructuring  or an alteration
                       of a Company's balance sheet (Bilanzanderung) or from any
                       Tax election or optional  accounting  method  change (not
                       including  an  amendment  of a  Company's  balance  sheet
                       (Bilanzberichtigung))  which  takes  place after the date
                       hereof  but has a  retroactive  effect on  (portions  of)
                       periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2004; provided
                       that such action is not  required by  applicable  laws or
                       regulations.

               (b)  Failure by SMSC to comply with its  cooperation  obligations
provided in Section 8.9(c) shall not relieve the  Shareholders'  indemnification
obligations  under Section 8.9(a) if and to the extent SMSC is able to show that
its failure has not materially  prejudiced the ability to defend such Tax claim.
If and to the extent  that SMSC is unable to show that its failure to comply has
not  materially   prejudiced   the  ability  to  defend  such  Tax  claim,   the
indemnification obligations under Section 8.9(a) shall not exist with respect to
such Tax claim.

               (c) SMSC shall ensure that (i) the  Companies  send without undue
delay  copies of all annual Tax  returns and  assessments  relating to Taxes for
(portions of) periods  ending on or prior to December 31, 2004 to the Management
Shareholders'  Representative  after their preparation or receipt,  and (ii) the
Companies notify in writing the Management Shareholders'  Representative without
undue delay about any  announcement  or commencement of a Tax audit or about any
finding which is made by authorities  which may give rise to an indemnity  claim
or refund  obligation  under this Section  8.9. In such case,  SMSC shall ensure
that the Companies grant access to the  Shareholders  (except for Yazaki and Mr.
Erdmann) and their tax advisors to all  relevant  Tax  returns,  assessments  of
Taxes or any  other  relevant  documents  relating  to Taxes for  (portions  of)
periods ending on or prior to the December 31, 2004.  SMSC shall ensure that, at
the  expense  of the  Shareholders  (except  for Yazaki  and Mr.  Erdmann),  the
Companies  challenge or take all reasonable  defensive  measures against any Tax
return, Tax assessment or any other procedure  relating to Taxes,  including the
filing of amended Tax returns  where  necessary to make  appropriate  collateral
adjustments or correlative  allocations arising from any Tax assessment or other
procedure,  for (portions  of) periods  ending on or prior to December 31, 2004,
and shall  keep the  Shareholders  (except  for Yazaki  and Mr.  Erdmann)  fully
informed  regarding the progress of any such  proceeding.  The  Shareholders and
their representatives shall be entitled to be present at any Tax audit as silent
observers  without any right to  interfere or actively  participate  in such Tax
audit.  The restriction  contained in the preceding  sentence shall not apply to
Mr. Hetzel as long as he is in the service of any of the Companies.

               (d) SMSC shall ensure that the Companies file all Tax returns for
(portions)  of periods  ending on or prior to December 31, 2004 as instructed by
the  Management  Shareholders'   Representative  provided  that  the  Management
Shareholders'  Representative can demonstrate that such instructions comply with
applicable laws and regulations.

               (e) Up to a  maximum  aggregate  amount  of 25 % of  the  Initial
Consideration,  any refund of Taxes for (portions of) periods ending on or prior
to December 31, 2004 exceeding the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of Tax claims
(excluding deferred Tax assets (aktive latente Steuern)) shown in the Management
Accounts and (ii) any Taxes caused by the Tax refunds,  shall be paid by SMSC to
the  Shareholders  (except  for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann)  after all Taxes of the
Companies  relating to (portions  of) periods  ending on or prior to 31 December
2004 have become finally binding and  non-appealable  or, in the sole discretion
of SMSC,  prior to such date.  If the  Shareholders  (except  for Yazaki and Mr.
Erdmann)  have,  in a case of a Tax  indemnification  under  this  Section  8.9,
completely fulfilled their obligation to indemnify and hold harmless SMSC or one
of the  Companies by making a respective  payment,  and the  indemnified  Tax is
thereafter finally and non-appealably  refunded to SMSC or one of the Companies,
SMSC  shall  re-pay  the  amount  of  such  refunded  Tax  to  the  indemnifying
Shareholders,  even if not all Taxes of the Companies  relating to (portions of)
periods  ending  on or  prior  to  December  31,  2004  have  become  final  and
non-appealable.  Section 8.6(c) shall apply mutatis  mutandis to any payments to
be made to the  Shareholders  under  this  Section  8.9(e).  The  claims  of the
Shareholders  under this  Section  8.9(e)  shall bear  interest at a rate of 4 %
above the base interest rate  (Basiszinssatz)  within  Section 247 of the German
Civil Code. Interest shall start to run ten (10) Business Days after the receipt
of the respective Tax refund.

               (f) To the  extent  SMSC or the  Companies  obtain a Tax  benefit
within the  meaning of Section  8.9(a)(ii)  which has not  reduced an  indemnity
payment  under  Section  8.9(a)  solely for the reason  that such Tax benefit is
obtained after the indemnity payment has already been made SMSC shall be obliged
to pay to the  Shareholders  in  proportion  to the  figures  set out in Section
8.6(c)(ii)  such  benefit  provided  that it does not  exceed  the amount of the
indemnity payment made under Section 8.9(a).

               (g)  Any  payment  to be  made  under  this  Section  8.9  by the
Shareholders  shall become payable ten (10) Business Days after the Shareholders
have  received a  notification  including an exact  calculation  in writing from
SMSC,  but not prior to the date at which the Taxes have  become due and payable
under applicable law.

               (h) Any and all claims against the Shareholders  pursuant to this
Section  8.9 shall  become  time-barred  for each Tax upon the  expiration  of a
period  of six  months  after the date on which the  assessment  concerning  the
respective Tax has become finally binding and non-appealable. Any and all claims
against SMSC  pursuant to this Section 8.9 shall become  time-barred  six months
after the date on which the assessment  concerning the respective Tax has become
finally   binding  and   non-appealable,   but  not  prior  to  the   Management
Shareholders'  Representative's notification pursuant to Section 8.9(c). For the
avoidance of doubt, the limitation  provisions contained in Sections 8.6 (d) and
(e) shall not apply to the Tax indemnity pursuant to this Section 8.9.

               SECTION 8.10 IP Indemnity.

               (a) The  Shareholders  (except for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann) shall
indemnify  SMSC and, at the request of SMSC,  SMSC Germany and/or the respective
Company,  from and against all Losses (thereby  putting SMSC and, at the request
of SMSC,  SMSC Germany and/or the respective  entity of the OASIS Group,  in the
financial  position  in which they would  have been had the  relevant  event not
occurred (Geldersatz)), which they may incur as a result of

               (i)     the use or exploitation of any  Intellectual  Property or
                       the conduct and  operations of the business in the manner
                       currently  conducted by the  Companies or as conducted by
                       the  Companies at any time in the past,  or the provision
                       of  services  therein,   infringing  upon,  violating  or
                       conflicting,  or having infringed upon or violated in the
                       past five (5) years, in any way any Intellectual Property
                       of any third party; provided that this shall not apply to
                       any  actual  or  possible  infringements,  violations  or
                       conflicts  disclosed  in Exhibit  6.9(f)  and/or  Exhibit
                       6.9(i); and

               (ii)    any of the Companies  misappropriating or misusing on the
                       date  hereof  or  having  in  the  past  five  (5)  years
                       misappropriated or misused any third party Trade Secrets.

               (b) The  Parties  agree  that  Sections  8.3 and 8.4 shall  apply
mutatis  mutandis to claims  pursuant to this Section 8.10.  In  particular  the
statutory obligation regarding mitigation of damage  (Schadensminderungspflicht)
and the statutory rules regarding the set-off of benefits (Vorteilsausgleichung)
shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions  contained in the second
sentence of Section 8.5 and in Section 8.6 shall apply to the specific indemnity
pursuant to this Section 8.10.

               (c) Claims based on this Section 8.10 shall become time-barred on
the third (3rd) anniversary of the date hereof.

               (d) If and to the extent  that SMSC,  SMSC  Germany or any of the
Companies has been  indemnified  from and against any Losses by the Shareholders
under this Section 8.10, the same Losses shall not be recoverable  under Section
8.3 in  connection  with the first  sentence  of  Section  6.9(i) or the  fourth
sentence of Section 6.9(k),  as the case may be. If and to the extent that SMSC,
SMSC Germany or any of the Companies has been  indemnified  from and against any
Losses  by the  Shareholders  under  Section  8.3 in  connection  with the first
sentence of Section 6.9(i) or the fourth sentence of Section 6.9(k), as the case
may be, the same Losses shall not be recoverable  pursuant to this Section 8.10.

               SECTION 8.11 Sardis Indemnity.

               (a) Except for (i) the fees and  expenses  already paid to Sardis
by OASIS  prior to the date  hereof  and (ii) the fees and  expenses  payable by
OASIS under the final invoice of Sardis delivered by the  Shareholders  pursuant
to Section  5.2(a)(iv),  the  Shareholders  (except for Yazaki and Mr.  Erdmann)
shall pay to SMSC or, at the request of SMSC,  to SMSC  Germany or to any of the
Companies, an amount necessary to indemnify and hold harmless SMSC, SMSC Germany
and/or  the  respective  Company  from  and  against  any  liability  whatsoever
vis-a-vis  Sardis arising out of or in connection  with the  agreements  between
OASIS and Sardis dated March 1, 2004 and July 5, 2004.

               (b) For the avoidance of doubt,  the provisions  contained in the
second  sentence of Section  8.5 and in Section 8.6 shall apply to the  specific
indemnity pursuant to this Section 8.11. Claims based on this Section 8.11 shall
become time-barred on the third (3rd) anniversary of the date hereof.

               (c) Section 8.3(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

               SECTION 8.12 Indemnification by SMSC and SMSC Germany.

               (a) If any of the  representations and warranties made by SMSC or
SMSC Germany in this  Agreement is  partially  or wholly  incorrect,  SMSC shall
indemnify and hold harmless the  Shareholders  from and against Losses resulting
from or arising out of any such  incorrectness  thereby putting the Shareholders
in the  position  in which  they would  have been had such  representations  and
warranties  been  correct.   In  determining  the  amount  of  the  Losses,  the
limitations  set  forth in  Sections  8.3(a)  and  8.6(e)  shall  apply  mutatis
mutandis.  Such indemnification shall be irrespective of any fault (Verschulden)
on the part of SMSC or SMSC Germany.

               (b) The  representations  and warranties set forth in Article VII
above  shall,  unless  timely  notified  prior  to  their  expiration  date,  be
time-barred (verjahren) eighteen (18) months after the date hereof.

               SECTION 8.13 Exclusion of Further Remedies.

               (a) The Parties agree that the rights and remedies  which a Party
may have with respect to a breach of a representation  and warranty contained in
Articles  VI and/or  VII are  limited  to the  rights  and  remedies  explicitly
contained in this Agreement.

               (b) With the  exception of the claims  expressly  provided for in
this Agreement,  any and all other rights, remedies and claims of the Parties as
a result  of any  incorrectness  of any of the  representations  and  warranties
contained  in  Articles  VI and/or VII or any defects  (Mangel),  in  particular
defects of  quality or legal  defects  of the OASIS  Shares,  the  Consideration
Shares, the Companies,  SMSC or SMSC Germany,  and any and all rights and claims
of any Party  against  any other  Party or such other  Party's  representatives,

with Section 311(2) of the German Civil Code) or as a result of positive  breach

               SECTION 8.14 Willful Default.

               The exclusions and limitations of rights and remedies pursuant to
this  Article  VIII  shall  not  apply in cases of  willful  deceit  (arglistige
Tauschung)  or in cases of willful  misconduct  (Vorsatz).  If any claim is made
against  a  Shareholder,  such  Shareholder  shall  not  bring  a  corresponding
reimbursement  claim  against  any  Company or any  director  or employee of any
Company  on the basis  that he had  relied on any  confirmation  or  information
provided by them before agreeing to any terms of this  Agreement;  provided that
the foregoing shall not apply in cases of, willful deceit or willful  misconduct

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   ----------

                                   COVENANTS
                                   ---------

               SECTION 9.1 Cooperation.

               After the date hereof,  to the extent  legally  permitted,  SMSC,
SMSC Germany and the Shareholders  shall, and SMSC shall cause the Companies to,
provide each other with such assistance (including making employees available to
such Party to a reasonable  extent during regular business hours) at the expense
of the  requesting  Party  as may  reasonably  be  requested  by such  Party  in
connection  with  the  preparation  of any Tax  return,  any Tax  audit,  or any
judicial,  administrative  or arbitral  proceeding or determination  relating to
liability for Taxes of SMSC,  SMSC Germany,  the  Shareholders or the Companies.
SMSC, SMSC Germany and the  Shareholders  shall treat all  information  obtained
pursuant  to  this  Section  9.1  as  confidential  except  to the  extent  that
disclosure thereof (i) is necessary for attainment of the purpose for which such
information was obtained or (ii) is required by law or by order of any court.

               SECTION   9.2   Undertaking   not  to  Compete  or  Hire   Staff;
Non-Solicitation of Customers.

               (a) Messrs. Hetzel, Heck, Klos, Winkelmann and Buhrer and OSS LLC
hereby undertake, for a period extending from the date hereof to the third (3rd)
anniversary  of  such  date,  not to  engage,  either  directly  or  indirectly,
personally  or through  other  individuals  or entities,  in any activity  which
competes with that of any of the Companies in their product and geographic areas
of business  conducted as of the date hereof (as  identified  by the  Companies'
sales-breakdown  by country in the last  eighteen  (18) months prior to the date
hereof)  or  envisaged  as of the date  hereof  to be  conducted  in the  future
(insofar as the  Companies  had already  undertaken  investments  in such future
business);  provided  that  none of the  Shareholders  shall be  prevented  from
holding  shares in any publicly  listed  company for  investment  purposes  only
(i.e., the mere holding of shares). The Parties agree that any holding of shares
exceeding 5% of any class of shares in any publicly  listed company is deemed to
be a  strategic  investment  (i.e.,  not  for  investment  purposes  only).  The
restrictions  contained  in this Section  9.2(a)  shall,  inter alia,  include a
prohibition  on being a controlling  shareholder,  controlling  partner or being
involved in any other  controlling  manner in any entity or enterprise  which is
involved in a restricted  activity as aforesaid during the aforesaid  three-year
non-competition  period.  In the event that any of the  aforesaid  provisions of
this  Section 9.2 are held by a court with proper  jurisdiction  to be partially
invalid as exceeding  legal limits,  such  provisions  shall be reduced to their
legally  authorized  maximum  limit.  In the  event  that  any of the  aforesaid
provisions  of this  Section  9.2 is so held to be  totally  invalid,  then  the
provisions of Section 10.3 below shall be applicable.

               (b) Each of Messrs.  Hetzel,  Heck, Klos,  Winkelmann and Buhrer,
OSS LLC, DEWB and Yazaki hereby undertake,  for a period extending from the date
hereof  to the  third  (3rd)  anniversary  of  such  date,  (i)  not to  solicit
(abwerben),  directly or indirectly,  personally or through other individuals or
entities,  any member of the Staff of any of the Companies or any  consultant of
any of the  Companies  with  the  result  that  such  member  of  the  Staff  is
subsequently employed or that such consultant is subsequently engaged by them or
by a third  party  without  the consent of SMSC and (ii) not to employ or engage
the  services  of any  member  of the  Staff  of  any  of the  Companies  or any
consultant  engaged by any of the  Companies;  provided that this Section 9.2(b)
shall only apply with  respect to persons who are  employed or engaged by any of
the Companies in a capacity other than purely secretarial.

               (c) Messrs. Hetzel, Heck, Klos, Winkelmann and Buhrer and OSS LLC
hereby undertake, for a period extending from the date hereof to the third (3rd)
anniversary  of such date, not to solicit any clients or customers of any of the
Companies  (with respect to products or services that compete with those offered
by the Companies) or endeavor to entice away from any Company any person who is,
or has at any time during the past two years  been,  a client or customer of any
of the Companies.

               (d) Should a  Shareholder  which is subject to the  provisions of
Section 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) not comply with such provision,  such Shareholder shall
be  liable  to  SMSC  for   payment  of   liquidated   damages   (pauschalierter
Schadensersatz)  in the amount of USD 250,000  for each case of  non-compliance;
provided,  however,  that with respect to Section  9.2(b),  Yazaki shall only be
liable  for  liquidated  damages,  if  it  fails  to  show  that  it  instructed
periodically  (i.e., every six months) the human resources  department of Yazaki
and its  subsidiaries in Europe,  Japan and North America to comply with Section
9.2(b).  The obligation to pay such  liquidated  damages shall be in lieu of any
claims  for  actual  damages  (Schadensersatzanspruche)  with  respect  to  such
non-compliance.  Should a Shareholder who is subject to the provision of Section
9.2(c) not comply with such provision,  such Shareholder shall be liable to SMSC
for payment of actual damages  (Schadensersatz)  incurred by SMSC,  SMSC Germany
and/or any of the  Companies.  Any other claims  (e.g.,  claims for  performance
(Erfullungsanspruche))  against the  non-complying  Shareholder  with respect to
such  non-compliance  shall not be excluded.  Section 8.3(c) shall apply mutatis
mutandis.

               SECTION 9.3 Publicity; Disclosure; Confidentiality.

               (a) The  Parties  shall make no press  release or similar  public
announcement with respect to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated
herein and shall keep  confidential  and not disclose or transmit copies of this
Agreement  to  any  third  party,  including  shareholders  or  members  of  the
Shareholders  (in  particular  to  members  of OSS LLC),  the  contents  of this
Agreement and any  confidential  information  disclosed to it in connection with
this  Agreement or its  implementation,  except as expressly  agreed upon by all
Parties  and  upon  such  third  party  executing  a  confidentiality  agreement
reasonably  acceptable to SMSC;  provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall
prevent any Party from making any  disclosures or statements (i) required by law
or rules of any stock exchange,  in particular,  SMSC's  disclosure  obligations
under U.S. securities laws, or (ii) with respect to information that has been or
become part of the public domain other than by default of the Shareholders. SMSC
shall announce the execution of this Agreement in accordance with all applicable
securities laws and stock exchange regulations.

               (b) The Shareholders shall keep secret and strictly  confidential
all information relating to the Companies and their businesses regardless of the
manner of acquisition  and of whether such  information has been given verbally,
in  writing  or  otherwise  (e.g.,  in the  form  of  drawings,  photographs  or
equipment) (Betriebs- und Geschaftsgeheimnisse) (the "Business Information"). In
particular, the Shareholders (i) shall not divulge to third parties any Business
Information;  (ii) shall  disclose  Business  Information  only to legal and Tax
advisers who are under a professional  duty to maintain secrecy and need to know
the Business  Information in order to make decision  making by the  Shareholders
possible;  and (iii) shall  neither  directly nor  indirectly  exploit  Business
Information on a commercial basis and shall make no use of Business  Information
unless  otherwise  agreed to in writing by SMSC. The obligations in this Section
9.3(b)  shall not apply to any  Business  Information  that can be proved (i) to
have been  disclosed  to the  Shareholders  in their  capacity as members of the
corporate  bodies  (Organmitglieder)  or employees of any of the  Companies  (in
which case the  confidentiality  obligation  pursuant  to the  relevant  service
agreement or employment agreement shall apply), (ii) to have been or become part
of the public domain other than by default of the Shareholders, or (iii) to have
come to the knowledge of the Shareholders  after the date hereof and not to have
been acquired by the  Shareholders  from sources under  obligation of secrecy to
SMSC or the Companies.

               SECTION 9.4 Obligations of the Shareholders concerning IP Rights.

               Messrs.  Hetzel,  Heck,  Klos,  Winkelmann and Buhrer and OSS LLC
hereby agree (i) to waive all claims to royalty  payments for the use of (and to
remuneration or compensation, irrespective of whether such compensation shall be
paid on a statutory  or  contractual  basis,  for  inventions  relating  to) any
Intellectual  Property  which is (x) owned by any of such  Shareholders  and (y)
based on developments or inventions made by such  Shareholder  prior to the date
hereof, and (ii) not to exercise any infringement  claims against SMSC or any of
its  Affiliates  or any of the  Companies  with  respect  to  such  Intellectual
Property as from the date hereof.  Messrs.  Hetzel,  Heck, Klos,  Winkelmann and
Buhrer and OSS LLC acknowledge and agree that the Initial  Consideration and the
Contingent  Consideration represent adequate compensation for the aforementioned
undertakings.  The  Parties  agree that the rights  and  obligations  of Messrs.
Hetzel,  Heck,  Klos,  Winkelmann  and Buhrer with  respect to  developments  or
inventions made by such Shareholder  during their employment or service with any
of the  Companies  after the date hereof  shall be  exclusively  governed by the
relevant employment  agreements and service agreements,  to the extent permitted
by applicable law.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

               SECTION 10.1 Investigations.

               Subject to Section 8.3(b) all representations and warranties made
in this Agreement  shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the  Shareholders
and SMSC,  as the case may be,  regardless  of any  investigation  made by or on
behalf  of SMSC or the  Shareholders,  as the  case may be.  Section  377 of the
German Commercial Code shall not apply.

               SECTION 10.2 Substitution and Assignment.

               This Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder cannot be
assigned or pledged by any Party hereto without the prior written consent of all
other  Parties.  However,  SMSC may assign all (but not part only) of its rights
(but not all or any of its obligations) under this Agreement to any Affiliate of
SMSC;  provided that such assignment occurs subject to the condition  subsequent
(auflosende  Bedingung)  of the assignee  ceasing to be an Affiliate of SMSC and
that the  assignor  may not  further  assign  any  rights so  assigned.  No such
assignment shall relieve SMSC of its obligations hereunder.

               SECTION 10.3 Severability.

               If any  provision  of this  Agreement  is held to be  invalid  or
unenforceable  in whole or in  part,  the  validity  and  enforceability  of the
remaining  provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected  thereby.  In such
event,  the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the  original  intent of the  Parties as  closely  as  possible  in an
acceptable  manner  to the end that the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

own expenses (including all fees and expenses of its  representatives,  counsel,
accountants and  consultants)  incurred by it in connection with the preparation
and  consummation of this Agreement,  the agreements  referred to herein and the
transactions  contemplated  herein; it being expressly  understood that any fees
and expenses  payable to Sardis  (other than (i) the fees and  expenses  already
paid to Sardis by OASIS prior to the date hereof and (ii) the fees and  expenses
due and  payable by OASIS  under the final  invoice of Sardis  delivered  by the
Shareholders pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(iv)),  if any, and to any other advisors
of any Company in  connection  with the  preparation  and  consummation  of this
Agreement, shall be exclusively borne by the Shareholders. SMSC and SMSC Germany
shall bear any transfer taxes incurred in connection  with this Agreement or its
implementation.

               SECTION 10.6 Governing Law.

               This  Agreement  shall be governed by, and construed and enforced
in  accordance  with,  the laws of the Federal  Republic  of Germany,  excluding
conflict of laws provisions.

               SECTION 10.7 Management Shareholders' Representative.

               (a) In order to enable SMSC and SMSC Germany to deliver  notices,
communications  and declarations of will at any time to each of Messrs.  Hetzel,
Heck,  Klos,  Winkelmann  and  Buhrer,  each  of  Messrs.  Hetzel,  Heck,  Klos,
Winkelmann  and Buhrer  hereby  irrevocably  appoint  Mr.  Herbert  Hetzel  (the
"Management   Shareholders'   Representative")  as  their  joint  representative
(Bevollmachtigter)  for the receipt (Empfang),  service  (Zustellung) and giving
(Abgabe) of all notices, communications and declarations of will, as well as for
all  arbitration-related  documents,  which relate to or are connected with this
Agreement and/or its implementation. The Management Shareholders' Representative
hereby consents to such appointment.

               (b)  In  case  SMSC  or  SMSC   Germany   receives  any  notices,
communications  and declarations of will from both the Management  Shareholders'
Representative and any of Messrs. Heck, Klos, Winkelmann and Buhrer, it shall be
entitled to rely solely upon any communications or writings given or executed by
the Management Shareholders' Representative.

               (c)   The    appointment   of   the   Management    Shareholders'
Representative  pursuant to Section  10.7(a) above shall only terminate upon the
appointment  of another  Management  Shareholders'  Representative  domiciled in
Germany,  which appointment needs to be notified to, and approved in writing by,
SMSC, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld.

               (d)  If  SMSC   has   notified   the   Management   Shareholders'
Representative  of an alleged claim under or in connection  with this  Agreement
which is asserted against the Management  Shareholders'  Representative  and the
Parties  represented  by  him  pursuant  to  Section  10.7(a),   the  Management
Shareholders' Representative and SMSC shall attempt in good faith (nach Treu und
Glauben) to reach  agreement on the disputed matter within a period of three (3)
weeks from the date of receipt by the Management Shareholders' Representative of
the  relevant  notification.  To the extent that  agreement  with regard to this
matter can be reached,  it shall become  binding  upon the  relevant  Parties by
execution  of a written  agreement to this effect duly signed by SMSC on the one
part and the Management Shareholders' Representative (acting in his own name and
on behalf of the Parties represented by him) on the other part. If in respect of
a claim  asserted under Articles VI or VIII agreement with regard to this matter
cannot be reached and the three-week period referred to in the first sentence of
this  Section  10.7(d)  expires  during the last three  weeks of the  limitation
period  applicable  to the relevant  claim under this  Agreement,  the period of
limitation with regard to that claim shall be extended by such three-week period
if SMSC or SMSC Germany would otherwise be precluded from bringing its claim.

               SECTION 10.8 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers.

               (a) This Agreement  (including all Exhibits  hereto) contains the
entire  agreement  between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect thereto.

               (b)  This  Agreement  (including  this  Section  10.8(b))  may be
amended or  supplemented  only if such amendment or  supplementation  is made in
writing executed by all Parties to this Agreement and explicitly  refers to this
Agreement. Waivers of any rights under this Agreement shall be valid and binding
only if made in writing.

               (c) The Parties  hereby  agree that the form of execution of this
Agreement  does not have to comply  with the  requirements  of unity of the deed
(Einheitlichkeit  der  Urkunde)  pursuant to Sections  126 and 127 of the German
Civil Code.

               SECTION 10.9 Set-off; Retention.

               SMSC's  and  SMSC  Germany's  right  of  set-off   (Aufrechnung),
retention     (Zuruckbehaltung)     or    other    refusal    of     performance
(Leistungsverweigerung)  with  regard  to  the  obligation  to pay  the  Initial
Consideration and/or the Contingent Consideration (including,  for the avoidance
of doubt,  the Share  Consideration)  and any interest  payable thereon shall be
excluded.

               SECTION 10.10 No Benefit to Third Parties.

               Except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this Agreement,  this
Agreement  shall only grant  rights to the  Parties and shall not  constitute  a
contract  for the benefit of third  parties  (Vertrag  zu Gunsten  Dritter) or a
contract with protective effect for third parties (Vertrag mit Schutzwirkung fur
Dritte).

               SECTION 10.11 Limited Claims of SMSC Germany.

               With the  exception of the claims  pursuant to Section 2.1,  SMSC
Germany shall not have any own (eigene)  claims against any of the  Shareholders
under  this  Agreement.  However,  any  Losses  incurred  by  SMSC  Germany  are
recoverable  by  SMSC,  to  the  extent  SMSC  has  any  indemnification   claim
(Schadensersatzanspruch) against the Shareholders under this Agreement.

               SECTION 10.12 Joint and Several Liability of SMSC.

               SMSC    hereby    assumes    joint    and    several    liability
(gesamtschuldnerische Haftung) for any and all obligations of SMSC Germany under
this Agreement.

               SECTION 10.13 Approval by SMSC.

               In its  capacity as sole  shareholder  of SMSC GmbH,  SMSC hereby
approves the execution by SMSC GmbH of this Agreement and all related agreements
and the performance by SMSC GmbH of all its obligations hereunder.
