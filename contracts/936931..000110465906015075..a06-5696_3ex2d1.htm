 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _ _Agreement__ "),
dated as of March 7, 2006, among SOURCECORP, Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation (the " _ _Company__ "), CorpSource Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _ _Purchaser__ "), and CorpSource
MergerSub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Purchaser (" _ _Merger Sub__ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Purchaser, Merger Sub
and the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _ _Merger__ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Purchaser and the stockholder of the Company set forth on the signature
pages thereto are entering into an agreement, pursuant to which, among other
things, such stockholder has agreed to vote in favor of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

  



  

1.1. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _ _DGCL__ "), at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth
in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

  



  

1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take
place (i) at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, 590 Madison
Avenue, New York, New York at 9:00 A.M. on the third business day following
the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time or on such other date as the
Company and Purchaser may agree in writing (the " _ _Closing Date__ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean any
day

        
   

  



  

ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day
on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York or
Dallas, Texas.

  



  

1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company and Purchaser will cause a
Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Delaware Certificate of Merger__ ") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware as
provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the
parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the "
_ _Effective Time__ ").

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation_

  



  

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Charter__
") shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_
 hereto, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

2.2. _The By-Laws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _By-Laws__
"), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  



  

 _Officers and Directors 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  



  

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the Board of Directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser of the resignations
of the directors of the Company, such resignations to be effective as of the
Effective Time.

  



  

3.2. _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter
and the By-Laws.

  



        
   

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Purchaser,
Merger Sub or their respective stockholders:

  



  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " and collectively, the " _ _Shares__
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (i) Shares owned by Purchaser or any direct or indirect Subsidiary
(as defined in Section 5.1(a)) of Purchaser, (ii) Shares owned by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for any such Shares held
on behalf of third parties, and (iii) Shares that are owned by stockholders
(" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a
demand for or lost appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ****
(" _ _Dissenting Shares__ ", and together with each Share referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _
_Excluded Shares__ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $25.00 per
Share (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly
representing any Share (other than any Excluded Share) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate and a
letter of transmittal (subject, in each case, to Section 4.2(e)), the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each certificate formerly
representing Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in
Section 4.2(f).

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in clause
4.1(a)(i) or 4.1(a)(ii) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

  



  

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
make available or cause to be made available to a paying agent selected by
Purchaser with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the " _ _Paying Agent__
"), amounts sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to all
issued and outstanding Shares pursuant to Section 4.1(a), exclusive of Shares
to be cancelled pursuant to Section 4.1(b) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). Any portion of the Exchange Fund
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) to pay for

  



        
   

  



  

Shares that become Dissenting Shares shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand; _provided_ , ___however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration for such Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed
to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholders
rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Paying
Agent agreement pursuant to which Purchaser shall appoint the Paying Agent
shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.
The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed
by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers
organized under the laws of a state of the United States of America, rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from any investment of
the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser shall be solely for the account of
the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid promptly to
Purchaser.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders
of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Purchaser and the Company may agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange
for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The
Per Share Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article IV upon conversion of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

  



  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to, and in
accordance with, Section 4.2(d), if, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or the
Paying Agent

  



        
   

  



  

for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article IV.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to applicable Laws,
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws (as defined in Section 5.1(i)). If any Certificates
shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) six years after
the Effective Time and (ii) the date immediately prior to such date as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity, any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the
property of the Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-
for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Purchaser, the posting by such Person of a bond
in reasonable amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by
Purchaser as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by
such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Dissenting Stockholder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such Dissenting Stockholder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section
4.2(a). The Company shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands,

  



        
   

  



  

and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are
received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Awards such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _
_Code__ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined
in Section 5.1(n)) Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity (as defined
in Section 5.1(d)(i)), and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or
Company Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the
case may be.

  



  

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Stock Plans (as
defined in Section 5.1(b)), whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the
Company, the Purchaser or Merger Sub, be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, from Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to
the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company
Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment and without interest. Any Company Option with an exercise price per
Share in excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration shall terminate and
cease to be exercisable as of the Effective Time and no holder of any such
Company Option shall be entitled to payment with respect to such termination.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any
kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits
measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of
Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for
issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans, other than
Company Options, but including each outstanding warrant to purchase Shares
(each, a " _ _Company Award__ " and collectively, the " _ _Company Awards__
"), shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, from Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award
contemplates the payment of a specified exercise price, the excess, if any,
of the Per Share Merger Consideration over such exercise price), less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment and

  



        
   

  



  

without interest. Any Company Award with an exercise price per Share in
excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration shall terminate and cease to be
exercisable as of the Effective Time and no holder of any such Company Award
shall be entitled to payment with respect to such termination.

  



  

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser and the
Company shall cooperate in taking all commercially reasonable efforts
necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, such actions by the
Companys Board of Directors and compensation committee which are required
under the Stock Plans, to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a) and
4.3(b) (without payment of any consent fees or cancellation fees to any
holders of Company Options or Company Awards).

  



  

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If the Company changes the number of
Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, as adjusted, shall, from
and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 4.4.

Governmental Entity or other third party in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser and Merger Sub and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain (x) is not reasonably
likely to prevent or materially delay the ability

  



        
   

  



  

### of Purchaser or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) would not be reasonably
likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Purchaser and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Purchaser and Merger
Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not,

and complete copy of (x) an executed commitment letter from the parties
signatory thereto to provide equity financing to Purchaser in an aggregate
maximum amount of $150,000,000 (the _" _Equity Commitment Letter_ "_) and
(y) an executed commitment letter from Credit Suisse, Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, UBS Loan Finance LLC and UBS Securities LLC (the _"
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ," _and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the _" _Financing Commitments_ "_) to provide Merger Sub and the Company with
(1) at least $175,000,000 in senior secured debt financing, (2) at least
$75,000,000 in senior secured revolving loans, and (3) at least $175,000,000
in senior subordinated increasing rate bridge loans or notes on identical

Financing_ "_) being collectively referred to as the _" _Debt Financing_ ,"_

Disclosure Letter (which description shall include the aggregate amount of
principal obligation expected to be owing on such date), and fees and
expenses of the Purchaser relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed
pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments,
together with the Companys and the Subsidiaries available cash, will be
sufficient for the Purchaser to pay the aggregate amount of the Per Share
Merger Consideration, the aggregate amount which will become due and owing to
holders of Company Options, Company Awards and Warrants, the aggregate amount
of any such indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
becomes due and payable in connection with the

the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form
provided to the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other
parties thereto. Purchaser or Merger Sub has fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letters to

conditions relating to fees to be paid, fee credits, "market flex", interest

shall cause Merger Sub, to agree to all requests and demands of such lenders
in connection with such determinations.

  

#### 

  

### (e) _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against
Purchaser or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise interfering
with, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Capitalization of Merger Sub and Purchaser_. The authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 1000 shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, 100 of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the

controls any companies or other entities that compete in any material respect
with any of the business lines or the businesses of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company. No Person under common management or direction

6.2. Acquisition Proposals.

  



  

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that it shall not,
and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives, collectively, "
_ _Representatives__ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

  



        
   

  



  

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly cooperate with or knowingly encourage or
otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or

  

#### 

  

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information, data, access
to its properties, assets, employees or Representatives in connection with or
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, this Agreement is adopted by vote of the Stockholders at the
Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4), the Company may: (A)
provide information, data, access to its properties, assets, employees
or Representatives in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for the
acquisition of more than 75% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more
than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company if
the Board of Directors receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not substantially
less favorable to the Company than to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7); (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) approve, adopt, recommend, or otherwise
declare advisable or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only
to the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or
(C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with Lehman or another nationally recognized investment
banking firm ( _" _Financial Advisor_ "_) and outside legal counsel, that
taking such action is necessary in order to comply with their respective
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in such case referred to in clause
(B) above, if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and outside Financial Advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal reasonably could result in a Superior Proposal (as
defined below); and (z) in such case referred to in clause (C) above (I) such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (II) Purchaser shall have
received written notice of the Companys intention to take the action
referred to in Clause (C) above, as applicable, at least four business days
prior to the taking of such action by the Company (the _" _Waiting Period_ "_)
and (III) during the Waiting Period the Company and its advisors shall have
negotiated in good faith with the Purchaser and Merger Sub to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, the Board of
Directors of the Company fully considers any such adjustment and nonetheless
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and Financial Advisor that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.

  



  

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

### 

  

" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (i) any proposal or offer from any Person
or group with respect to a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or (ii) any proposal
or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of any
class of equity securities or consolidated total assets (including, without
limitation,

  



        
   

  



  

equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal (except that the phrase "25% or more of any class of equity
securities or consolidated total assets" shall be replaced by the phrase "50%
or more of any class of equity securities or 75% of consolidated total
assets") made by a Person other than a party hereto that the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and outside Financial Advisor) has determined in its good faith judgment,
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal, the likelihood of consummating the transaction, the likely
consummation date of the transaction contemplated by the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal, if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(a)).

  



  

(c) _No Change in Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
Board of Directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not:

  

### 

  

(i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2(c), withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or
publicly propose), in a manner adverse to Purchaser, the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Merger (it being understood that (1) if
publicly taking a position is required under applicable Law, that publicly
taking a neutral position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (2)
privately taking a neutral position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
or (3) publicly or privately taking no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal shall, in any such case, not be considered an adverse
modification; and, it being further understood that, if publicly taking a
position is not required under applicable Law, that publicly taking a neutral
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered
an adverse modification);

  

#### 

  

(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit

consult with the other on all of the information relating to Purchaser or the
Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy
Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
Purchaser shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  

### 

  

(ii) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to

occurrence of the Closing); _provided_ , _further_ , that, for purposes of
clauses (A)(III) and (A)(IV)

limited to the making of a request by the Company to its independent
accountants and its attorneys to provide such reasonable assistance and the
Companys providing of such information in connection therewith as such
accountants or attorneys shall reasonably request, and such efforts shall be
deemed to have been fulfilled by the Company and its Subsidiaries if such
actions are taken; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company shall not
be required to provide any such assistance which would interfere unreasonably
and materially with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable,

definitive documents) (A) any of the conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) any other provision of the
Debt Commitment Letter, in either case to the extent such amendment,
modification or supplement would have the effect of amending, modifying or
supplementing the conditions or contingencies to funding in a manner which
would materially delay the Closing or cause the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(d) not to be satisfied. In the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, otherwise than due to the material breach of
representations and warranties or covenants of the Company or a failure of a
condition to be satisfied by the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub will use
all reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative debt financing from the
same or other sources on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Purchaser and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that, in the event that
(1) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as High Yield
Financing has not been consummated and (2) all of the conditions to the
Purchasers obligations to effect the Merger set forth in Article VII have
been satisfied or waived (other than the condition set forth in Section
7.2(d)), Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use, if available, the Bridge
Financing (or such alternative bridge financing) to replace such High Yield
Financing within 30 days after the 25-day period set forth in Paragraph 5 of
Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter has elapsed. Subject to the Companys
compliance with Section 6.5(b)(ii), Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use all
reasonable best efforts to satisfy on or before the Closing all conditions

its employees, properties, Tax Returns, books, contracts and records and,
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Purchaser all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company

shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) to disclose any privileged
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) to violate any

substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those received immediately prior
to the Closing (including, without limitation, benefits pursuant to qualified
retirement and savings plans, medical, dental and pharmaceutical plans and
programs, deferred compensation arrangements and equity-based and incentive
compensation plans). For purposes of each Purchaser employee benefit plan
providing medical, dental, prescription drug, vision, life insurance or

Purchaser shall cause its employee benefit plans to (x) waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions and limitations, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or good health and actively-at-work exclusions of its employee
benefit plans with respect to such employees and their dependents to the same
extent such exclusions, limitations or other conditions were waived or
satisfied under a comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y)
take into account any eligible expenses incurred by such employees and their
dependents for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payment, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements and like adjustments or limitations on

Company prior to the date hereof, in each case, to the extent the Surviving
Company is legally required to do so.

  



  

6.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.5 and 6.5(d)(ii),
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense.

  



  

6.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a)  From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former director or
officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _
_Indemnified Parties__ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, including amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _ _Costs__
") incurred in connection with any claim, Action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, that are, in whole or in part, based on or
arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or serve or served as a fiduciary
under, or with respect to, any employee benefit plan at any time maintained
by or contributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Despite the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.10(a), neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any indemnity obligation pursuant to this
Section 6.10(a) to the individuals listed in Section 6.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent arising out of the matters described in such
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such claim, Action, suit,
proceeding or

  



        
   

  



  

investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation of any
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any
such claim, Action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time) (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,
which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, promptly after
statements therefore are received and otherwise advanced to such Indemnified
Party upon request of reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably
incurred, (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the defense of
such matter and (iii) any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth
under applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation or by-laws shall be
made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). If such indemnity is not available with respect to any
Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party
shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect relative faults and benefits.

  

### 

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__"), or
Purchaser shall provide for equivalent directors and officers
liability insurance covering the individuals who are covered by the DandO
Insurance on the date hereof and providing benefits and levels of coverage
that are no less favorable than those provided under the DandO Insurance, with
respect to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time for a period of six
years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not
in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof (the " _ _Current Premium__ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the existing DandO Insurance or such insurance provided by Purchaser expires,
is terminated or cancelled or is otherwise unavailable on such terms during
such six year period, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance with the best terms
available as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium
not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 300% of the Current Premium; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that, in the alternative, the Surviving Corporation
may purchase as of the Effective Time a tail policy with respect the DandO
Insurance, which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the
Effective Time through and including the date six years after the
Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain
substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the coverage currently provided by the
DandO Insurance.

  

### 

  

(d) If Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions

operations, properties, assets or liabilities of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each party hereto shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
be deemed to have relied upon, all representations, warranties and covenants
of each other party set forth in this Agreement that have been or are made in
favor of such party, notwithstanding any investigation or examination
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) about the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any

implied, including, without limitation, as to the accuracy or completeness of
any information regarding the Company or any of its businesses furnished or
made available to Purchaser or Merger Sub.

  



  

6.13. _Solvency Opinion_. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts

Directors of a reputable third party appraisal firm, dated as of the Closing
Date, that, following consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not (A) be
insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its
debts is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair
saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts as they mature), (B) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business or (C) have

the Merger may be abandoned by action of the Board of Directors of the
Company at any time prior to the time of adoption of this Agreement at the

Period_ "_)), the Companys Board of Directors determines to recommend

paid not later than the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
immediately prior to the time and date on which the Company enters into an
agreement with respect to an Alternate Acquisition Proposal payable by wire
transfer of same day funds.

  



  

(c) If after the date hereof a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been
communicated to the Company or publicly announced, or any Person shall have
communicated to the Company or publicly announced, that, subject to the

8.4(b) and a fee has not been paid in respect of Section 8.5(b) above, and
concurrently with such termination or within twelve months after such
termination the Company shall agree to an Acquisition Proposal with the
Person who made such communication to the Company or public announcement, or
an Acquisition Proposal with the Person who made such communication to the
Company or public announcement shall be consummated, then the Company shall

such Acquisition Proposal, pay the Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_
, that, (x) the Termination Fee shall only become payable to Purchaser under
this Section 8.5(c) in connection with a termination pursuant to Section
8.4(b) in the event that Purchasers termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.4(b) was a result of a willful or intentional breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement committed after the date on which such bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been communicated to the Company or publicly announced,
such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be
satisfied and (y) no Termination Fee shall be payable under this Section
8.5(c) in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a) if, on or
prior to the time of such termination, all of the conditions to Purchasers
obligations set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 were satisfied, other than the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(d). All payments under this Section 8.5(c)
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds.

  



  

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then the
Company shall, on the date that this Agreement is terminated pay Purchaser
(or any Affiliate or Affiliates of Purchaser as Purchaser may designate) all
of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party charges and
expenses actually incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a
maximum amount of $4,000,000 (the " _ _Expense Reimbursement__ "), payable
by wire transfer of same day funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Expense Reimbursement provided for in this Section 8.5(d) shall not
become payable to Purchaser if Purchaser or Merger Sub have breached their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately caused the failure to
obtain the Stockholder Approval.

  



  

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections
8.5(b), (c) and (d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Purchaser and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly any
amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(b), (c) or (d), and to obtain such
payments, Purchaser or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the Company for the fee, charges or expenses to which
reference is made in this paragraph (e), the Company shall pay to Purchaser
or Merger Sub their respective costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee
at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. If the Company pays amounts due under Section 8.5(b),
(c) or (d), such payment shall be Purchasers and Merger Subs sole and
exclusive remedy for monetary damages with respect to a termination of this
Agreement.

warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

  



  

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 4.2
(Exchange of Certificates), Section 4.3 (Treatment of Stock Plans) and
Section 6.10 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only,
Purchaser and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create any
third party beneficiaries or otherwise confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without
limitation, the right to rely upon the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein.

  



  

9.9. _Obligations of Purchaser and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Purchaser to take any action, such requirement shall
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Purchaser to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  



  

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

and Merger Sub against liability for any such Taxes and

  



        
   

  



  

Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. Where any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement is qualified by
reference to the knowledge of the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, such
knowledge shall mean the actual knowledge of the individuals listed on Annex
B or Annex C, as applicable, without inquiry.

  



  

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section
or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Any item disclosed in a section of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed in all other sections of
the Company Disclosure Letter and shall qualify the representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.1. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." References in this Agreement to
the "date hereof" mean the date of this Agreement as indicated in the
Preamble.

  



  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

(c) The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise; _provided_ , that Purchaser may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date hereof shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to

  



        
   

  



  

such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any
such designation shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially
impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void _ab
initio_.

  



  

9.15. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, it is agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5(d).

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date hereof.
