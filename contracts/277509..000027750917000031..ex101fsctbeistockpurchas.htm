STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"),
dated as of May 8, 2017, is by and between GenNx/TBEI Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the "Seller"), and Federal Signal
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"). RECITALS WHEREAS, the
Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of GenNx/TBEI Intermediate Co., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). WHEREAS, the Preferred Holders
collectively own all of the Preferred Shares. WHEREAS, after the redemption
of the Preferred Shares at or prior to the Closing (the "Redemption"), the
Shares will constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company. WHEREAS, (i) the Seller desires to sell, convey, assign, transfer
and deliver to the Purchaser all of the Shares and (ii) the Purchaser desires
to acquire and accept the Shares, in each case upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I PURCHASE AND SALE 1.1 Purchase of
Shares. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, at the Closing, the Seller
shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller, all of the
Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Shares, free and clear of
Liens other than Liens arising from applicable state or federal securities
Laws and Liens created by or through the Purchaser. 1.2 Purchase Price. The
consideration payable to the Seller on the Closing Date for the purchase and
sale of the Shares shall be an aggregate amount in cash equal to (i) the
Enterprise Value, plus (ii) the Estimated Closing Cash, minus (iii) the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, minus (iv) the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, minus (v) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, minus (vi) the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, minus (vii) the Certificate Escrow Amount, plus (viii) the
Working Capital Overage, if any, and minus (ix) the Working Capital
Deficiency, if any (after giving effect to the foregoing, the "Closing
Purchase Price"). After the Closing, the Closing Purchase Price may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 1.6 (as so adjusted, the "Purchase Price").  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas006.jpg) 

\- 2 - 1.3 Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) at the offices
of Winston and Strawn LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166-4193 or
remotely via electronic exchange of documents and signatures, on the Business
Day immediately before the last day of the Purchaser's fiscal month, if each
of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof are satisfied or waived
(other than, but subject to satisfaction of, the conditions to be satisfied
on the Closing Date), or at such other time and place as may be agreed to by
the parties hereto in writing. Such time and date are referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date". Subject to the provisions of Article VIII of
this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.3
shall not result in the termination of this Agreement and shall not relieve
any party to this Agreement of any obligation under this Agreement. 1.4
Payment. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered:
(a) to the Escrow Agent, an amount in cash equal to the sum of (A) the
Indemnity Escrow Amount to be held in an escrow account (the "Indemnity Escrow
Account"), (B) the Adjustment Escrow Amount to be held in an escrow account
(the "Adjustment Escrow Account") and the Certificate Escrow Amount to be
held in an escrow account (the "Certificate Escrow Account"), in each case by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; (b) to the Persons entitled thereto, an aggregate amount in cash
equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness (less the Indebtedness described
in subclause (c) of the definition thereof), in each case, in accordance with
the instructions set forth in payoff letter(s) in respect of such
Indebtedness delivered to the Purchaser by the Seller prior to the Closing
pursuant to Section 6.2(c)(iii); (c) to the Persons entitled thereto, an
aggregate amount in cash equal to the Estimated Transaction Expenses, in each
case, in accordance with instructions to be delivered to the Purchaser by the
Seller at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that (i) any Estimated Transaction Expenses paid pursuant to this
Section 1.4(c) to any of the Target Companies and ultimately payable to an
employee of any of the Target Companies shall thereafter be paid by such
Target Company to the applicable Person (net of withholding taxes and
employer payroll taxes) through such Target Company's payroll system, and (ii)
any Taxes withheld from any payment under clause (i) shall be held and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority in a proper and timely
manner; and (d) to the Seller, an amount in cash equal to the Closing
Purchase Price, by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds,
to an account designated in writing by the Seller at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing. The payments made by the Purchaser pursuant to
subsections (b) and (c) above are, and/or for all purposes will be
considered, payments on behalf of the Target Companies, as applicable, and in
respect of obligations and liabilities of the Target Companies, as applicable.  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas007.jpg) 

\- 3 - 1.5 Pre-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. At least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement (the "Estimated Statement") setting forth the Seller's good faith
estimates of (i) the Net Working Capital (the "Working Capital Estimate") as
of immediately prior to the Closing without giving effect to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and determined in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Principles, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Company
Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (iii) the aggregate amount of all
Transaction Expenses accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Closing
(the "Estimated Transaction Expenses") and (iv) the aggregate amount of
Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"). The Seller shall provide a
reasonable level of supporting documentation for the Estimated Statement and
any additional information reasonably requested by the Purchaser related
thereto. A "Working Capital Overage" shall exist when (and shall be equal to
the amount by which) the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Target Working
Capital. A "Working Capital Deficiency" shall exist when (and shall be equal
to the amount by which) the Target Working Capital exceeds the Working
Capital Estimate. 1.6 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) Adjustment
Statement. As soon as practicable but in no event later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a statement
(the "Adjustment Statement") setting forth the Purchaser's good faith
calculations of (i) the Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the
Closing without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and determined in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles (the
"Final Working Capital"), (ii) the aggregate amount of the Company
Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Final
Indebtedness"), (iii) the aggregate amount of all Transaction Expenses
accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Final
Transaction Expenses") and (iv) the aggregate amount of Closing Cash (the
"Final Closing Cash"), in each case, together with related supporting
schedules, calculations and documentation. (b) Review and Dispute. Within
forty-five (45) days following receipt by the Seller of the Adjustment
Statement, the Seller shall either inform the Purchaser in writing that the
Adjustment Statement is acceptable, or deliver written notice (the "Notice of
Disagreement") to the Purchaser of any dispute the Seller has with respect to
the preparation or content of the Adjustment Statement or the amounts
reflected therein. The Notice of Disagreement must describe in reasonable
detail the items contained in the Adjustment Statement that the Seller
disputes. If the Seller does not notify the Purchaser of a dispute with
respect to the Adjustment Statement within such forty-five (45)-day period,
such Adjustment Statement and the amounts reflected in the Adjustment
Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event
a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to the Purchaser, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute, and any
determination resulting from such good faith negotiation shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. (c) Accounting Firm. If the Purchaser
and the Seller, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) days after the Seller delivers the Notice of
Disagreement, then the Purchaser and the Seller jointly shall engage the
Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute in accordance with the standards set
forth in this Section 1.6(c).  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas008.jpg) 

\- 4 - The Seller and the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted
to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days of the making of such
submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
shall be limited to whether the items in dispute that were properly included
in the Notice of Disagreement (i) were prepared in a manner consistent with
the definitions of the Working Capital Estimate, the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the Estimated Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Closing
Cash, as the case may be, and (ii) were, in the case of Indebtedness,
Transaction Expenses and Closing Cash, determined in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and, in the case of Net Working Capital,
were prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles, and
the Accounting Firm shall determine, on such basis, whether and to what
extent, the Adjustment Statement and the amounts reflected therein, as
applicable, require adjustment. The Accounting Firm shall not make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether the Target Working
Capital or any of the Working Capital Estimate, the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the Estimated Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Closing
Cash are correct. The Accounting Firm's decision shall be based solely on
written submissions by the Seller and the Purchaser and their respective
representatives and not by independent review, and each of the Seller and the
Purchaser shall have the opportunity to respond in writing to the other's
written submission. The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in
dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Seller, on the one hand,
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm that
is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. (d) Access. For purposes of giving
effect to the terms set forth in this Section 1.6, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, the Purchaser shall cooperate with and make available to the
Seller and its representatives all information, records, data, working papers
(including those working papers of its accountants), supporting schedules,
calculations and other documentation that provides reasonable detail, as the
Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Purchaser's
calculation of the amounts set forth in the Adjustment Statement, and shall
permit reasonable access to the Target Companies' facilities, personnel and
accountants, as may be reasonably required in connection with the review or
analysis of the Adjustment Statement or the amounts reflected therein and the
resolution of any disputes in connection therewith; provided, however, any
such access shall be in a manner as not to unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Purchaser or the Target Companies. (e) Downward Adjustment.
If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, then the Purchase Price will be
adjusted downward by the absolute value of such Net Adjustment Amount (the
"Downward Adjustment Amount"). If the Downward Adjustment Amount is equal to
or less than the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow Account, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent, within five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Net
Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas009.jpg) 

\- 5 - Section 1.6, instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser,
from the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow Account, an amount equal to
the Downward Adjustment Amount. If the Downward Adjustment Amount is greater
than the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow Account, the Purchaser and
the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent,
within five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Net Adjustment Amount
is finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.6, instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay to the Purchaser: (i) all funds available in the Adjustment
Escrow Account; and (ii) from the Indemnity Escrow Account, an amount equal
to the amount by which the Downward Adjustment Amount exceeds such funds
available in the Adjustment Escrow Account. (f) Upward Adjustment. If the Net
Adjustment Amount is positive, then the Purchase Price will be adjusted
upward by such positive Net Adjustment Amount (the "Upward Adjustment
Amount"), and the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the
Upward Adjustment Amount within five (5) Business Days from the date on which
the Net Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.6.
(g) No Adjustment. If the Net Adjustment Amount is zero, there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1.6. (h) Release of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount. Within five (5) Business Days after the date on
which the Net Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.6, the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver any
portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount not distributed to the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.6(e) (if any) to the Seller. (i) Exclusive Remedy. For
the avoidance of doubt, recovery from the Adjustment Escrow Account or, if
applicable, the Indemnity Escrow Account, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates
for and in respect of any Downward Adjustment Amount and neither the Seller,
nor any of its Affiliates or any other Person, shall have any liability or
obligation under this Section 1.6 for any portion of the Downward Adjustment
Amount following the depletion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. ARTICLE II REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING

however, that the Seller or GenNx instructs such Persons to keep such
information confidential and not use such information for any purpose other

the Purchaser's requirement to comply with SEC Rule 3-05 shall not be a
condition to the Closing. 5.3 Preservation of Records. Following the Closing,
the Purchaser agrees that it shall, and it shall cause the Target Companies
to, preserve and keep the records held by them or their Affiliates as of the
Closing Date relating to the business of the Target Companies Date in
accordance with the terms of the Purchaser's applicable document retention
policy for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date. 5.4 Reasonable
Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date
(including actions necessary to prevent the entry of any injunction or other
Order and to appeal as promptly as possible any such injunction or other
Order that may be entered in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) and (ii) refrain from taking  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas033.jpg) 

\- 29 - any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
impede the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur by the Outside Date.
5.5 Consents. Without limiting the generality of Sections 5.4 and 5.6, each of
the parties hereto will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the
Closing, including the consents and approvals referred to in Sections 2.5,
3.4 and 4.3. Each of the parties hereto will make or cause to be made all

Laws (and such filings shall request "early termination" of any applicable
waiting periods) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement in the case of all filings required under
the HSR Act and within ten (10) Business Days in the case of all other

Authority in respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate
with each other in connection with any such filing (including, to the extent
appropriate and permitted by applicable Law, providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith)
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of
the FTC, the Department of Justice or other Governmental Authority under any
Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties shall each pay one-half of all filing fees under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. (b) To the extent not expressly barred by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority, each such party
shall promptly inform the other party hereto of any oral communication with,
and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. Neither the Purchaser nor
the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas034.jpg) 

\- 30 - opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law,
the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Any party
may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties under this
Section 5.6 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials. (c) Each of the
Purchaser and the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or constituting anticompetitive conduct (collectively, the
"Antitrust Laws"). Each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration of the notice periods
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. 5.7 Public
Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or stock exchange
requirements, the parties hereto shall not issue any report, statement or
press release or otherwise make any other public statement with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without prior
consultation with and approval of the other party; provided, that nothing
contained herein shall limit a party's ability to take action, and to disclose
information in connection therewith, to exercise such party's rights under
this Agreement or any Transaction Document or otherwise in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. 5.8 Updates. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Seller shall promptly notify the
Purchaser by written update to the Disclosure Schedule hereto (i) if any
representation or warranty made by the Seller in this Agreement was, when
made, or has subsequently become, untrue in any material respect, (ii) of the
occurrence or non- occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to
the obligations of the Purchaser to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (iii) of the failure of the Seller to
comply in all material respects with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which may reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party hereto to effect the transactions contemplated
hereby not to be satisfied (each a "Update"). Any disclosure in any such
Update shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for
purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) have been satisfied; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that (i) any Update relates to facts or conditions,
or the occurrence of any event, arising after the  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas035.jpg) 

\- 31 - date of this Agreement, (ii) the representation or warranty to which
the subject matter of any such Update specifically relates was, without
giving effect to the facts, conditions or event disclosed in such Update, as
of the date of this Agreement true and correct in all material respects, and
(iii) the facts, conditions or event disclosed in such Update would,
individually or in the aggregate with the matters set forth in all other
Updates, give the Purchaser the right to elect to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) if the 20 day cure period described therein had
lapsed or Section 8.1(f) and the Purchaser does not make such election within
ten (10) Business Days of its receipt of such Update, such Update shall be
deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement for all purposes hereof,
including with respect to the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and
6.2(g). 5.9 DandO Indemnification. (a) The Purchaser agrees that all rights of
the stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers and controlling
Persons of the Target Companies (each of them acting in such capacity at or
prior to the Closing Date) to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the respective Fundamental Documents of the Target Companies as
now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the
Target Companies, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. (b) Prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall acquire a "tail" insurance policy that provides
officers' and directors' liability insurance covering the Persons who are, as
of and prior to the Closing Date, covered by the Target Companies' officers'
and directors' liability insurance policies with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to and on the Closing Date and provide evidence
thereof to the Purchaser. At Closing, the Purchaser shall reimburse the
Seller for 50% of the actual cost of such policy, not to exceed $22,500. (c)
The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each such Person entitled to indemnification, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives. 5.10 Tax Matters. (a)
Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. (i) The Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or
cause to be filed, any Tax Return of the Target Companies due (after taking
into account all appropriate extensions) on or before the Closing Date and any
Income Tax Return of the Target Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (the
"Seller Prepared Returns"). Such Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting
methods, and, to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in Section
5.10(a)(v). At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any Seller
Prepared Return due after the Closing Date, the Seller shall submit such
Seller Prepared Return to the Purchaser for its review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or condition.
Thereafter, the Purchaser shall cause the applicable Target Company to sign
and timely file the Seller Prepared Return in the form agreed to by the Seller  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas036.jpg) 

\- 32 - and the Purchaser. At least three (3) days prior to the due date of
any Seller Prepared Return due after the Closing Date, the Seller shall pay
to the Purchaser (for payment to the applicable Governmental Authority) the
amount of Tax shown as due and payable with respect to such Tax Return. (ii)
Any tax allocation or sharing agreement or arrangement, whether or not
written, that may have been entered into among the Target Companies or with
the Seller shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and after the Closing
Date neither any Target Company nor the Purchaser shall be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder. (iii) The Purchaser, at the cost and expense
of the applicable Target Company, shall timely prepare and file, or cause to
be timely prepared and filed, when due, all Tax Returns of the Target
Companies due after the Closing Date (including all Straddle Period Tax
Returns) other than Seller Prepared Returns (the "Purchaser Prepared
Returns"). To the extent that a Purchaser Prepared Return relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting
methods of the Target Companies in effect as of the Closing Date, and, to the
extent applicable, the conventions provided in Section 5.10(a)(v). At least
ten (10) days prior to the due date of any such Purchaser Prepared Return
that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period and that shows an
Indemnified Tax, the Purchaser shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to
the Seller for the Seller's review and comment. With respect to any such
Purchaser Prepared Return, the Purchaser shall consider the Seller's comments
in good faith; provided, however, that Purchaser shall be required to
incorporate Seller's comments except to the extent that (i) the draft of such
Purchaser Prepared Return provided to the Seller by the Purchaser was
prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures, practices and
accounting methods and any deviation was required by applicable Law or (ii)
they relate to a position for which the draft of any such Purchaser Prepared
Return provided to the Seller by the Purchaser has substantial authority. At
least three (3) days prior to the due date of any Purchaser Prepared Return
due after the Closing Date, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser (for payment
to the applicable Governmental Authority) the amount of any Indemnified Tax
shown as due and payable with respect to such Tax Return. (iv) The Purchaser
shall not, and shall not allow any Target Company to amend any Tax Return of
any of the Target Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
or otherwise initiate (or otherwise participate in) any other Seller Approved
Tax Matter without the prior written permission of the Seller, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that if any
Seller Approved Tax Matter is required by applicable Law, as reasonably
determined in good faith by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall notify the
Seller in writing prior to initiating such Seller Approved Tax Matter and
shall provide the reason therefor but shall not be required to receive the
prior written permission of the Seller to initiate such Seller Approved Tax
Matter. (v) The Purchaser and the Seller agree with respect to certain Tax
matters as follows: (A) That the Company shall have a year ending as of the
Closing Date and shall file an IRS Form 1120 for the year ended as of the
Closing Date.  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas037.jpg) 

\- 33 - (B) That any Income Tax deduction with respect to any Transaction
Deduction paid or accrued on or prior to the Closing Date shall be deducted in
a Pre- Closing Tax Period (or portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) and no party hereto shall apply the "next day rule" under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such deductions. (C)
That the Company shall timely make an election under Rev. Proc. 2011-29 to
deduct seventy percent (70%) of the Transaction Deductions that are success-
based fees as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.263(a)-5(f). (D) To treat (and
cause the Target Companies to treat) any gains, income, deductions, losses,
or other items realized by the Target Companies resulting from any Purchaser
Closing Date Transaction as occurring on the day after the Closing Date and
each party hereto shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Target Companies
to) utilize the "next day rule" in Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)
(or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law) for purposes of
reporting such items on applicable Tax Returns. (E) That no election shall be
made by any party (and the Purchaser shall cause the Target Companies not to
make any election) under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or any similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law) to ratably allocate items
incurred by the Target Companies. (F) That no election shall be made to waive
the carry back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit
incurred or realized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by any Target Company; (G)
To treat all interest and other earnings on the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
Indemnity Escrow Amount and Certificate Escrow Amount as income of the
Purchaser in accordance with the transition rule set forth in Proposed Treas.
Reg. Section 1.468B-8(h)(2). (H) To treat any indemnification payments and
any payments pursuant to Section 5.10(g) as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all relevant Tax purposes. (I) That no election under Code Section 338(g)
or Code Section 336(e) shall be made with respect to the acquisition of the
Shares contemplated by this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by Law, no
party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) file a Tax Return that is
inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to this Section 5.10(a)(v), and no
party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) to take any position
during the course of any Tax Contest or other audit or proceedings that is
inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to this Section 5.10(a)(v). (b)
Straddle Period Tax Returns. To the extent it is not permitted or required in
a jurisdiction to elect to have each Tax year of the Target Companies end on
the Closing Date, such that the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries is
required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the parties agree to use
the following conventions for determining the amount of  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas038.jpg) 

\- 34 - Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying
the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes
(including Income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes and withholding
Taxes), the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be determined as if the Company and/or its
Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing
Date using a "closing of the books methodology." For purposes of the
foregoing, (A) any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the relative
number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period; (B) any Tax or item of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit resulting from a Purchaser Closing Date
Transaction shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date; and (C) any item of deduction
attributable to any Transaction Deductions shall be allocated to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. (c) Cooperation on Tax
Matters. The Seller and the Purchaser shall (and the Purchaser shall cause
the Target Companies to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of
any Tax Return of the Target Companies; (ii) assist in any audit or other
proceeding with respect to the Tax Returns or Taxes of the Target Companies;
(iii) make available any information, records, or other documents relating to
any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Target Companies; (iv) provide any
information required to allow the Seller, the Purchaser and the Target
Companies to comply with any information reporting contained in the Code or
other applicable Laws; and (v) provide certificates or forms, and timely
execute any Tax Returns, that are necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax. (d) Transfer Taxes. The
Purchaser will pay, and will indemnify and hold the Seller harmless against,
any documentary, stamp, stock transfer, or similar Tax imposed on any of the
Target Companies or the Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any related penalties or interest (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes"). (e) Tax Contests. (i) If any Governmental Authority issues to the
Purchaser or any of the Target Companies (1) a notice of its intent to audit
or conduct another proceeding with respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of any of
the Target Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (2)
a notice of deficiency for Taxes for any such period, the Purchaser shall
notify the Seller in writing of its receipt of such communication from the
Governmental Authority within ten (10) days of receipt and provide the Seller
with copies of all correspondence and other documents received from the
Governmental Authority. The Target Companies, as applicable, shall control
any audit or other proceeding in respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Target Companies (a "Tax Contest"); provided, however, (1) the Seller, at the
sole cost and expense of the Seller, and in accordance with Section
5.10(e)(ii), shall have the right to control  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas039.jpg) 

\- 35 - (including the settlement or resolution thereof and the selection of
counsel); and (2) the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Target
Companies not to, settle, resolve, or abandon a Tax Contest (whether or not
the Seller participates in or controls such Tax Contest) for a Pre- Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written permission of the
Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).
(ii) If the Seller elects to control a Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (1) the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing of such intent;
(2) such control and Tax Contest shall be solely at the Seller's cost; (3)
the Purchaser shall promptly complete and execute, and promptly cause the
Company or its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, as applicable, to complete
and execute, any powers of attorney or other documents and take other
reasonable actions that the Seller requests to allow the Seller to control
such Tax Contest (provided, however, that the Seller shall promptly reimburse
the Purchaser for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Purchaser in connection therewith); (4) prior to the Seller taking
control, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the applicable Target Company to
control such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith and after the Seller
takes control, the Seller shall control such Tax Contest diligently and in
good faith; and (5) while it controls a Tax Contest, the Seller shall (A)
keep the Purchaser reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax
Contest; (B) allow the Purchaser or any Target Company, at the Purchaser's
sole cost and expense, to participate in such Tax Contest; (C) to the extent
it seeks the Purchaser's assistance, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in
providing such assistance; and (D) not settle, resolve, or abandon any such
Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). (iii) If the Seller
does not control a Tax Contest (by election) that relates to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period, (1) the Purchaser shall control, or cause the
applicable Target Company to control such Tax Contest diligently and in good
faith; (2) if such Tax Contest relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax
Contest shall be solely at the Seller's cost and if such Tax Contest relates
to a Straddle Period, the costs of such Tax Contest shall be apportioned
between Purchaser and Seller in the same manner as the underlying Tax; (3)
the Purchaser shall keep the Seller reasonably informed regarding the status
of such Tax Contest; (4) the Purchaser shall allow the Seller, at the
Seller's sole cost and expense, to participate in such Tax Contest; and (5)
the Purchaser shall not settle, resolve or abandon (or cause the applicable
Target Company to settle, resolve or abandon) the Tax Contest without the
prior written consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). (f) Tax Refunds. All refunds of Taxes (other than
refunds of Transfer Taxes) received by the Purchaser or any Target Company
(each, a "Tax Refund" and, collectively, "Tax Refunds") after the Closing
Date relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date as determined in accordance with the same
principles provided for in Section 5.10(b)) (whether in the form of cash
received or a credit or offset against Taxes otherwise payable) shall be the
property of the Seller to the extent such Tax Refund was not included as an
asset in the computation of the Final Working Capital or arises as a result of
a Transaction Deduction. To the extent that the Purchaser or any of the
Target Companies receives a Tax Refund that is the property of the Seller
pursuant to this Section 5.10(f), the  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas040.jpg) 

\- 36 - Purchaser shall pay the amount of such Tax Refund (and interest
received from the Governmental Authority) to the Seller on behalf of the
Seller. The amount due to the Seller shall be payable to the Seller ten (10)
days after receipt of the Tax Refund from the applicable Governmental
Authority (or, if the Tax Refund is in the form of credit or offset, ten (10)
days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit or offset),
net of any Taxes imposed on the Purchaser or any Target Company by reason of
such Tax Refund. Upon the reasonable request of the Seller, the Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim (and shall cause the
Target Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to claim) any refunds
that will give rise to a payment to, or on behalf of, the Seller under this
Section 5.10(f). (g) Payment for Tax Benefits. To the extent that the
Purchaser, any of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates
actually realizes any Tax Benefit in a Post- Closing Tax Period (or portion of
a Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date) as a result of
the Transaction Deductions, the Purchaser shall within ten (10) days of
realizing such Tax Benefit or filing the Tax Return claiming such Tax
Benefit, pay to the Seller for distribution to the Seller the amount of such
Tax Benefit. 5.11 Employee Matters. (a) For a period of at least one (1)
year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Target Companies to, provide each Continuing Employee (solely to the extent
that such Continuing Employee remains employed by the applicable Target
Company) with (i) base salary or hourly base rate (as applicable) that are at
least equal to the base salary or hourly base rate in effect for such
employee immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) annual cash bonus
opportunity (expressed as a percent of pay) that is at least equal to the
annual cash bonus opportunity in effect for such employee immediately prior to
the Closing. Until December 31, 2017, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Target Companies to, provide each Continuing Employee (solely to the
extent that such Continuing Employee remains employed by the applicable
Target Company) with employee benefits that are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to the employee benefits provided by the Target Companies, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Closing. (b) As of the Closing Date, and
until December 31, 2017, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Target
Companies to, take commercially reasonable action to cause any third party
insurance providers or third party administrators to (i) waive all limitations
as to any pre- existing condition or waiting periods under the applicable
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the Purchaser with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
employee under any such plans, programs and arrangements that such employee
may be eligible to participate in as of and after the Closing, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to
such employee and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing under any
comparable Company Benefit Plan; (ii) give each employee full credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement, and full credit for purposes of accrual of benefits under any
such plans, programs or arrangements providing vacation benefits, of the
Purchaser that such employee may be eligible to participate in as of and
after the Closing for such employee's service with any of the Target
Companies to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of
any comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing (except
to the extent that such credit  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas041.jpg) 

\- 37 - would result in the duplication of benefits); and (iii) recognize the
dollar amount of all co- payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred
by each employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant health and welfare
benefit plans in which such employee (and dependents) will be eligible to
participate as of and after the Closing. (c) Nothing herein shall be
construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee, to
modify the at-will nature of any employee's employment, or to create any
right of any employee to employment or continued employment for any specified
period or to a particular term or condition of employment. (d) From and
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Target Companies to comply
with the WARN Act and any similar state and local statutes and regulations
with respect to employees and former employees of any of the Target Companies.
5.12 No Solicitation of Transactions. The Seller shall not and shall cause the
Target Companies not to, directly or indirectly, take (and the Seller shall
not authorize each of their respective directors, managers, officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and
other representatives or, to the extent within the Company's control, other
Affiliates to take) any action to (a) solicit, initiate or facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (c) participate in any way in negotiations with, or furnish any
information to, any Person in connection with, or the making of any proposal
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement,
the Seller shall and shall cause the Target Companies to cease immediately
and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 5.13
Release. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries) hereby releases the Purchaser and its Affiliates
and its members, managers, officers, directors, stockholders, partners,
employees, agents and attorneys, and each of them (collectively, the
"Purchaser Released Parties"), from any and all claims, and agrees not to
bring or threaten to bring or otherwise join in any claim against any of the
Purchaser Released Parties or any of them, relating to, arising out of or in
connection with any facts or circumstances relating to any of the Target
Companies which existed on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim specifically provided for
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 5.14 RWI Policy. The
representation and warranty policy (the "RWI Policy") obtained by the
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be on customary terms and conditions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, (a) the insurer thereunder expressly waiving, and agreeing not to
pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation rights against the Seller
with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder, and (b) the insurer
thereunder expressly agreeing that the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have
no obligation to pursue any claim against the Seller in connection with any
loss, liability or damage) and in the

\- 38 - form attached hereto as Exhibit A, and shall not be amended and/or
modified in a manner adverse to the Seller unless approved in writing by the

respect to representations and warranties that are made as of a specific
date, the failure to be true and correct as of such date), in each case
without giving effect to any qualifications as to materiality, Material

and warranties (provided, that the word "material" shall not be read out of

subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller, its Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, managers, officers, members, shareholders, partners,

contained in Article IV in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the
date such representation or warranty was made and as of the Closing Date (or
with respect to representations and warranties that are made as of a specific
date, the failure to be true and correct as of such date), in each case
without giving effect to any qualifications as to materiality, material
adverse effect or similar qualifications contained in such representations
and warranties; and (b) any breach by the Purchaser of any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement. 7.4 Indemnification of Purchaser

contrary, the rights of the Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification under
this Agreement are subject to the following additional terms: (a) Deductible;
Cap. The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover any Losses
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) until the total of all such Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) exceeds $1,350,000 (the "Deductible").
Subject to the  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas047.jpg) 

\- 43 - preceding sentence, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to
recover Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 7.2(a) in excess

Indemnity Escrow Account. Absent fraud, all claims (other than a Certificate
Claim) for Losses made by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement
shall be satisfied solely out of the funds available in the Indemnity Escrow

as provided in Section 7.4(c) or Section 8.2(b). (c) Certificate Claims;
Release of Certificate Escrow Account. (i) Absent fraud, subject to the terms

funds in the Certificate Escrow Account to the Seller pursuant to Section
7.4(c)(ii)(A) and until the earlier of: (x) the Certificate Termination Date;
and (y) the date on which the Certificate Percentage is equal to 100%, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to recover directly from the Seller, and the
Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless from, all Losses in
respect of Certificate Claims, up to a maximum of $1,000,000 for all such
recovered Losses. (ii) The Certificate Escrow Account shall be distributed as
provided in this Section 7.4(c)(ii). (A) Subject to Section 7.4(c)(ii)(B),
within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Certificate
Escrow Period: (1) the Purchaser shall prepare, and deliver to the Seller, a
written statement setting forth the Purchaser's good faith calculation of the
applicable Certificate Percentage as of the end of such calendar quarter along
with true, correct and complete copies of the Tax Certificates collected by
the Purchaser and its Affiliates during such calendar quarter; and (2) the
Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller, from the
funds available in the Certificate Escrow Account, an amount equal to the
product of: (x) $100,000; and (y) the increase in the Certificate Percentage
(expressed as a number rather than a percentage and rounded down to the
nearest whole number) from the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
provided, however, that if as of the end of the applicable calendar quarter,
the Certificate Percentage is 90% or more, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller, all of the funds then available in the
Certificate Escrow Account. (B) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to
the contrary, the Certificate Escrow Account shall not be reduced pursuant to
this Section 7.4(c) below the amount of any unresolved or pending
Indemnification Claims, or settled but not yet paid Indemnification Claims,
in each case in respect of a Certificate Claim. (d) Reduction. The Purchaser
Indemnitees' right to indemnification or reimbursement from the funds
available in the Indemnity Escrow Account or the Certificate  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas048.jpg) 

\- 44 - Escrow Account or pursuant to Section 7.4(c)(i), as applicable,
pursuant to this Agreement on account of any Losses shall be reduced by (i)
all insurance or other proceeds actually recovered by the Purchaser
Indemnitees from third parties, including pursuant to indemnification
obligations of third parties in favor of the Target Companies, less any
related costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, costs of recovery,
related attorneys' fees, any applicable deductible amount and any resultant
increase in insurance premiums; (ii) the amount of any Tax Benefit actually
realized by Purchaser Indemnitee or its Affiliates after the Closing Date as a
result of such Losses in the taxable year of such Losses or the immediately
succeeding taxable year; and (iii) any accruals or reserves on the Financial
Statements or the calculation of Net Working Capital with respect to which
such Losses relate. If any Purchaser Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates
(including the Target Companies) receives any insurance or other proceeds from
third parties after receiving an indemnification payment for the related
Loss, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the amount of such proceeds to
the extent such proceeds did not reduce the indemnity payment for the Loss
within ten (10) days of the receipt of such proceeds. If any Purchaser
Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates (including the Target Companies) actually
realizes any Tax Benefit after the Closing Date for the taxable year of the
Loss or the immediately succeeding taxable year that was not included in the
initial computation of the Loss, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the
amount of such Tax Benefit. The amount of any payment for a Tax Benefit that
is due under the prior sentence shall be paid within ten (10) days of the due
date of the Tax Return (without regard to extensions) with respect to which
the Tax Benefit is realized (or, if the Tax Benefit is in the form of an
increased refund, within ten (10) days of the receipt of such Tax Refund from
the applicable Governmental Authority). The Purchaser shall take all
commercially reasonable actions (and shall cause the Target Companies to take
all commercially reasonable actions) to timely claim any Tax Benefit that
shall reduce the amount of a Loss, or give rise to a payment to or for the
benefit of the Seller under this Section 7.4(c). (e) No Claims. The Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not have any claim for Losses under this Agreement to the
extent such claim for Losses was specifically reflected in the Working
Capital Estimate or the Adjustment Statement or was resolved pursuant to the
post- Closing Purchase Price adjustment procedures set forth in Section 1.6.
(f) Limitation on Liability. Any Loss under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. (g) Limitation on Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Seller shall not be required to
pay (or otherwise indemnify for) any Tax of the Target Companies (from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, the Certificate Escrow Account or otherwise) that is
not an Indemnified Tax. (h) Calculation of Losses. In determining the amount
of Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a), any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty shall be disregarded. (i)
Subrogation. Solely to the extent a Purchaser Indemnitee has received payment
for any Losses with respect to an Indemnification Claim (whether from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, the Certificate Escrow Account or from the Seller
pursuant to Section  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas049.jpg) 

\- 45 - 7.4(c)(i)), the Seller shall have the right of subrogation to pursue
recovery under the AIG Specialty Insurance Company, Buyer-Side Representation
and Warranties Insurance Policy No. 49156550 and the Euclid Transactional,
LLC, Buyer-Side Representations and Warranties Policy #ET111-00-027 in
respect of the Losses to which the payment related. 7.5 Exclusive Remedy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except with respect to the matters
set forth in Section 1.6 and other than in the case of fraud, the parties
agree that, from and after the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive remedies
of the parties to this Agreement and the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims
for breach of contract, warranty, tortuous conduct (including negligence) or
otherwise predicated on common law, equity, statute, strict liability or
otherwise) arising out of or based upon the matters set forth in this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, are the indemnification
obligations of the parties set forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing
Date, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights
and claims for Losses it may have against the other party arising under,
based upon or relating to this Agreement, any applicable Law, common law or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII).The provisions of this Section 7.5 shall not, however,
prevent or limit a cause of action under Section 9.13 to obtain an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof. THE PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES, EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY
ANY STATUTE OR OTHER LAW WHICH MAY LIMIT THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT
TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. THE PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE PURCHASER
INDEMNITEES, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. THE PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE
PURCHASER INDEMNITEES, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN
ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT. 7.6 Procedures. The following
procedures shall apply to all claims for indemnification and reimbursement
pursuant to this Article VII, other than those relating to Tax matters, which
are governed by Section 5.10: (a) Notice of Losses by Purchaser Indemnitee.
(i) Indemnification Claims. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, if any Purchaser Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a
claim for indemnification against the funds available in the Indemnity Escrow
Account or the Certificate Escrow Account or against the Seller pursuant to
Section 7.4(c)(i), as applicable (an "Indemnification Claim"), the Purchaser
shall, promptly after it becomes aware of such Indemnification Claim but in
any event prior to the Indemnification Termination Date or the Certificate
Termination Date, as applicable, notify the Seller and the Escrow Agent, if
applicable, of such Indemnification Claim by means of a written notice
specifying the nature, circumstances and amount of such Indemnification Claim
accompanied by a certificate of an officer of the Purchaser setting forth
with reasonable particularity the underlying facts actually  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas050.jpg) 

\- 46 - known or in good faith believed by such officer to exist sufficient
to establish, as of the date of such certificate, the basis for the
Indemnification Claim and setting forth the Purchaser's good faith
calculation of the Losses incurred by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitee with
respect thereto, and including copies of all written documentation in the
possession of the Purchaser Indemnitees relating to the circumstances or
events giving rise to such Indemnification Claim (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may not make an
Indemnification Claim or deliver an Indemnification Claim Notice regarding
Losses which it believes may arise from a claim by a third party (whether
private or governmental) unless such third party has actually commenced a
Proceeding, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the making of a claim by
such third party against a Purchaser Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to
give an Indemnification Claim Notice under this Section 7.6(a)(i) will
adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that the Purchaser
Indemnitees has under this Agreement, or alter or relieve the Seller of its
obligation to indemnify the applicable Purchaser Indemnitee except to the
extent that the Seller is materially prejudiced thereby. On the
Indemnification Termination Date, the funds available in the Indemnity Escrow
Account, net of the amount of any unresolved or pending Indemnification
Claims, or settled but not yet paid Indemnification Claims, other than in
respect of a Certificate Claim, asserted by the Purchaser prior to the
Indemnification Termination Date, shall be released by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, any remaining
funds retained for any unresolved Indemnification Claims (if any) as set
forth above, shall be paid to the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, upon
resolution of such Indemnification Claims in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if, by 5:00 p.m. New York time
on the Indemnification Termination Date, the Purchaser has not delivered to
the Seller an Indemnification Claim Notice other than in respect of a
Certificate Claim, the funds available in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall
be released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. On the Certificate Termination Date, the funds available in the
Certificate Escrow Account, net of the amount of any unresolved or pending
Indemnification Claims, or settled but not yet paid Indemnification Claims,
asserted with respect to a Certificate Claim by the Purchaser prior to the
Certificate Termination Date, shall be released by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, any remaining
funds retained for any unresolved Indemnification Claims (if any) as set
forth above, shall be paid to the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable,
upon resolution of such Indemnification Claims in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if, by 5:00 p.m. New York
time on the Certificate Termination Date, the Purchaser has not delivered to
the Seller an Indemnification Claim Notice with respect to a Certificate
Claim, the funds available in the Certificate Escrow Account shall be
released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. (ii) No Disputes. If the Purchaser delivers an Indemnification
Claim Notice in accordance with the terms in Section 7.6(a)(i) and the Seller
does not object to the terms of the Indemnification Claim as set forth in the
applicable Indemnification Claim Notice within thirty (30) days of the
Seller's receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice: (A) the Purchaser and
the Seller shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
setting forth the terms of release from the Indemnity Escrow Account or the
Certificate Escrow Account, as applicable, and instructing the Escrow Agent
to release funds to the Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow Account or the
Certificate Escrow Account, as applicable; or (B) to the extent applicable
pursuant to Section 7.4(c)(i), the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, the  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas051.jpg) 

\- 47 - amount set forth in the Indemnification Claim Notice, by means of a
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account designated in
writing by the Purchaser, in each case , subject to the limitations contained
in this Agreement. (iii) Disputes. If the Purchaser delivers an
Indemnification Claim Notice in accordance with the terms in Section
7.6(a)(i) and the Seller objects to the terms of the Indemnification Claim as
set forth in the applicable Indemnification Claim Notice within thirty (30)
days of the Seller's receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery
of a notice to the Purchaser in writing, that the Seller objects to the
Indemnification Claim (or the amount of Losses set forth therein) asserted in
such Indemnification Claim Notice (a "Dispute Notice"). Following receipt by
the Purchaser of the Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
promptly use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and
to what extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification on
account of such Indemnification Claim. If the Purchaser and the Seller are
able to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser receives
such Dispute Notice: (A) the Purchaser and the Seller shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent setting forth such agreement and, as
applicable, instructing the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Indemnity
Escrow Account or the Certificate Escrow Account, as applicable; or (B) to
the extent applicable pursuant to Section 7.4(c)(i), the Seller shall pay to
the Purchaser, the applicable amount set forth in the Indemnification Claim
Notice, by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account designated in writing by the Purchaser, in each case subject to the
limitations contained in this Agreement. If the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser
receives such Dispute Notice, then the dispute must first be submitted to
non-binding mediation to be held in New York, New York. If the Purchaser and
the Seller are still unable to reach agreement within forty-five (45) days
after the first (1st) meeting with the mediator, then the dispute may only be
submitted to, and settled by, an individual arbitrator mutually selected by
the Seller and the Purchaser (if the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to
agree upon the arbitrator, they shall each select an arbitrator and the two
selected arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as the
arbitrator). The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York pursuant to
the Federal Arbitration Act and in accordance with the then- prevailing
International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable, the award rendered by
the arbitrator in respect of a dispute pursuant to this Section 7.6(a)(iii)
shall be final and binding (absent fraud or manifest error), and any
arbitration award may be enforced by judgment entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the mediator and the
arbitrator shall be allocated between the Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items submitted to the mediator or arbitrator, as the
case may be, that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such disputed items
so submitted. For all purposes of this Article VII, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with the other party and its
representatives (including to the extent appropriate and permitted by
applicable Law, providing information, records and data), and shall permit
reasonable access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the resolution of such disputes. (b) Notice of
Losses Provided by Seller Indemnitee. As soon as is reasonably practicable
after a Seller Indemnitee obtains knowledge of any matter which has or may  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas052.jpg) 

\- 48 - Losses, the Seller shall give notice of such matter by means of a
written notice specifying the nature, circumstances and amount of such claim
accompanied by a certificate of an officer of the Seller setting forth with
reasonable particularity the underlying facts actually known or in good faith
believed by such officer to exist sufficient to establish, as of the date of
such certificate, the basis for such claim and setting forth the Seller's
good faith calculation of the Losses incurred by the applicable Seller
Indemnitee with respect thereto, and including copies of all written
documentation in the possession of the Seller Indemnitees relating to the
circumstances or events giving rise to such claim (a "Claims Notice") to the
Purchaser. No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Seller to
the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.6(b) will adversely affect any of
the other rights or remedies that the Seller has under this Agreement, or
alter or relieve the Purchaser or the Company of their obligation to
indemnify the applicable Seller Indemnitee except to the extent that they are
materially prejudiced thereby. (c) Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims.
In the event of any claim by a third party against any Purchaser Indemnitee
or Seller Indemnitee for which indemnification is or may be available under
this Article VII (whether pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or
otherwise, a "Third Party Claim"), the party against whom indemnification may
be sought hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") shall be entitled and, if it
so elects, shall at its own cost and expense, (i) take control of the defense
and investigation of such Third Party Claim and (ii) pursue the defense
thereof in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings promptly taken or
instituted and diligently pursued, including to employ and engage attorneys of
its own choice reasonably acceptable to the party seeking indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") to handle and defend such Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but not obligated), if
it so elects, to compromise or settle such claim; provided, that the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall only be required in respect of any
compromise or settlement that (i) imposes any injunctive relief or other
equitable order against the Indemnified Party, (ii) contains any admission of
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or (iii) does not include as a term
thereof by the Person(s) issuing such claim against the Indemnified Party a
customary release of liability with respect to such claim. In the event the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense and investigation
of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 7.6(c), the
Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the
investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 7.6(c) within fourteen (14) days after delivery
of the Claim Notice in connection with such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted shall (upon
delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to
undertake the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third Party Claim,
which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement, and in the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the
claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. (d)
To the extent this Section 7.6 is inconsistent with Section 5.10(e) with
respect to any Tax matter, the provisions of Section 5.10(e) shall control.

\- 49 - 7.7 Mitigation. Each party shall take commercially reasonable steps
to mitigate any of its Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Each party hereto
shall cooperate with the other with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other
party hereunder, including by using reasonable best efforts to mitigate or
resolve any such claim or liability; provided, however, that such party shall
not be required to make such efforts if they would be detrimental in any
material respect to such party. In the event that any party shall fail to
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate or resolve any claim or
liability, then (unless the proviso to the foregoing sentence shall be
applicable) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the other party shall
not be required to indemnify or reimburse any Person for any Losses that
could have been avoided if such party had taken such steps. ARTICLE VIII

the Purchaser by the Seller; provided, however, that no cure period will be
required for any such breach that by its nature cannot be cured; (e) by the
Purchaser, if the Seller breaches any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations under this Agreement in a manner such that any

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas056.jpg) 

\- 52 - the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable thereto. The mere inclusion of
any matter, information or item in any Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed to constitute an admission
of any liability by the Seller or any other Person to any third party or
otherwise imply that any such matter, information or item is material or
creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, no such inclusion of a possible breach or violation
of any contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or
indication that breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. 9.4
Amendment, Modification and Waiver. Except as provided in Section 5.8, this
Agreement, including any Annex, Exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule, may be
amended, modified or supplemented at any time only by written agreement
signed by the Seller and the Purchaser. Any failure of the Seller to comply
with any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived by the Purchaser,
and any failure of the Purchaser to comply with any term or provision of this
Agreement may be waived by the Seller, in each case, at any time by an
instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such other party, but such
waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure to comply. Further, neither the waiver by any of
the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other
breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. 9.5 Entire Agreement. This
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits, schedules and other
documents referred to herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) which
form a part hereof contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, oral and written, with respect to its subject
matter (other than the Confidentiality Agreement). 9.6 Severability. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement for any reason is declared invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement, which other
provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the application of such
invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall be valid
and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Upon such
declaration that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 9.7 Binding Effect; Assignment.
This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
executors, successors and permitted assigns, but except as contemplated
herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, by operation
of Law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; provided, however, that the Purchaser may assign its  

  

 ![](ex101fsctbeistockpurchas057.jpg) 

\- 53 - obligations hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Purchaser; provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve the
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation
of this Section 9.7 shall be void. 9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except
(i) current and former, stockholders, members, managers, officers, directors
and employees of the Target Companies pursuant to Section 5.9, (ii) GenNx
pursuant to Sections 5.2(e), and (iii) as provided in Article VII with
respect to the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person (including any
employee or former employee of any of the Target Companies) or entity any

reason of this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to
Section 5.11. 9.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Article
I and Sections 5.6, 5.10 and 7.6(a)(iii), whether or not the transactions

this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that the parties shall bear equally the fees and expenses
of the Escrow Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall pay all

first (1st) succeeding Business Day thereafter. The provisions of this

its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and each of their respective
directors, managers, stockholders, members, partners, officers and employees,
and each of their successors and assigns (all such parties, the "Waiving
Parties"), that (i) the Law Firm may represent the Seller and each of its
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the one
hand, and the Target Companies, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other
agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (such representation, the "Current
Representation"), and (ii) the Law Firm may represent the Seller Group or any
director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller
Group, in each case in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim,
proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
including under Section 1.6 and Article VII, any agreements contemplated by
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such
representation, the "Post-Closing Representation") notwithstanding such
representation (or any continued representation) of the Target Companies, and
the Purchaser on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents
thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest
or any objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. The Purchaser
acknowledges that the foregoing provision applies whether or not the Law Firm
provides legal services to the Target Companies after the Closing Date. The
Purchaser, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that: (a) all communications between the Seller Group and their
counsel, including the Law Firm, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications (collectively, the "Protected Communications") between the
Seller Group and such counsel and neither the Purchaser, nor any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser or any of the Waiving
Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process; and (b) from and after
the Closing, the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Target Companies to, on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waive and not assert any attorney-
client privilege with respect to any Protected Communications; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if any, and then solely to the
extent that Protected Communications or the associated rights to waive or
assert the attorney-client privilege and right of confidentiality of any
Target Company with respect to such Protected Communications, relates to any
third-party disputes or claims involving a Target Company, then (A) the
Target Company shall be entitled to retain a copy of such Protected
Communications and be entitled to access such Protected Communications, (B)
the Protected Communications shall be subject to joint privilege with the
applicable Target Company and member of the Seller Group and (C) the Target

Communications (and may waive such privilege with the prior written consent

damage would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with the
specific terms thereof or otherwise breach such provisions, and that money
damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. The parties hereto
accordingly agree (on behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries
of this Agreement provided in Section 9.8) that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent

provisions hereof (including the parties' obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Purchaser's obligation to pay, and
the right of the Seller to receive, the Purchase Price) in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service of summons
and complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 9.14 shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each party hereto
agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law. 9.15 Governing Law. This Agreement shall
be governed by the Laws of the State of New York, excluding choice of law
principles that would require the application of the Laws of a jurisdiction
other than the State of New York. 9.16 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE MAXIMUM
