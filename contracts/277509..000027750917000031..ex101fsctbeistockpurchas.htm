At least two (2) Business Days prior to &#13;&#10;the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the &#8220;Estimated &#13;&#10;Statement&#8221;) setting forth the Seller&#8217;s good faith estimates of (i) the Net Working Capital (the &#13;&#10;&#8220;Working Capital Estimate&#8221;) as of immediately prior to the Closing without giving effect to any &#13;&#10;of the transactions contemplated hereby and determined in accordance with the Applicable &#13;&#10;Accounting Principles, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Company Indebtedness outstanding as of &#13;&#10;immediately prior to the Closing (the &#8220;Estimated Closing Indebtedness&#8221;), (iii) the aggregate &#13;&#10;amount of all Transaction Expenses accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Closing &#13;&#10;(the &#8220;Estimated Transaction Expenses&#8221;) and (iv) the aggregate amount of Closing Cash (the &#13;&#10;&#8220;Estimated Closing Cash&#8221;). The Seller shall provide a reasonable level of supporting &#13;&#10;documentation for the Estimated Statement and any additional information reasonably requested &#13;&#10;by the Purchaser related thereto. A &#8220;Working Capital Overage&#8221; shall exist when (and shall be &#13;&#10;equal to the amount by which) the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Target Working &#13;&#10;Capital.

As soon as practicable but in no event later than &#13;&#10;ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a statement (the &#13;&#10;&#8220;Adjustment Statement&#8221;) setting forth the Purchaser&#8217;s good faith calculations of (i) the Net &#13;&#10;Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing without giving effect to any of the &#13;&#10;transactions contemplated hereby and determined in accordance with the Applicable Accounting &#13;&#10;Principles (the &#8220;Final Working Capital&#8221;), (ii) the aggregate amount of the Company &#13;&#10;Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (the &#8220;Final Indebtedness&#8221;), (iii) &#13;&#10;the aggregate amount of all Transaction Expenses accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to &#13;&#10;the Closing (the &#8220;Final Transaction Expenses&#8221;) and (iv) the aggregate amount of Closing Cash &#13;&#10;(the &#8220;Final Closing Cash&#8221;), in each case, together with related supporting schedules, calculations &#13;&#10;and documentation. &#13;&#10;(b) Review and Dispute.  Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by the &#13;&#10;Seller of the Adjustment Statement, the Seller shall either inform the Purchaser in writing that &#13;&#10;the Adjustment Statement is acceptable, or deliver written notice (the &#8220;Notice of Disagreement&#8221;) &#13;&#10;to the Purchaser of any dispute the Seller has with respect to the preparation or content of the &#13;&#10;Adjustment Statement or the amounts reflected therein.  The Notice of Disagreement must &#13;&#10;describe in reasonable detail the items contained in the Adjustment Statement that the Seller &#13;&#10;disputes.  If the Seller does not notify the Purchaser of a dispute with respect to the Adjustment &#13;&#10;Statement within such forty-five (45)-day period, such Adjustment Statement and the amounts &#13;&#10;reflected in the Adjustment Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.  In the &#13;&#10;event a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to the Purchaser, the Purchaser and the Seller shall &#13;&#10;negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute, and any determination resulting from such good &#13;&#10;faith negotiation shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.  &#13;&#10;(c) Accounting Firm.  If the Purchaser and the Seller, notwithstanding such &#13;&#10;good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the Seller delivers the &#13;&#10;Notice of Disagreement, then the Purchaser and the Seller jointly shall engage the Accounting &#13;&#10;Firm to resolve such dispute in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section 1.6(c).  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>

The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting &#13;&#10;Firm shall be limited to whether the items in dispute that were properly included in the Notice of &#13;&#10;Disagreement (i) were prepared in a manner consistent with the definitions of the Working &#13;&#10;Capital Estimate, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the Estimated Transaction Expenses and &#13;&#10;the Estimated Closing Cash, as the case may be, and (ii) were, in the case of Indebtedness, &#13;&#10;Transaction Expenses and Closing Cash, determined in accordance with the terms and conditions &#13;&#10;of this Agreement and, in the case of Net Working Capital, were prepared in accordance with the &#13;&#10;Applicable Accounting Principles, and the Accounting Firm shall determine, on such basis, &#13;&#10;whether and to what extent, the Adjustment Statement and the amounts reflected therein, as &#13;&#10;applicable, require adjustment.  The Accounting Firm shall not make any other determination, &#13;&#10;including any determination as to whether the Target Working Capital or any of the Working &#13;&#10;Capital Estimate, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the Estimated Transaction Expenses and &#13;&#10;the Estimated Closing Cash are correct. The Accounting Firm&#8217;s decision shall be based solely on &#13;&#10;written submissions by the Seller and the Purchaser and their respective representatives and not &#13;&#10;by independent review, and each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall have the opportunity to &#13;&#10;respond in writing to the other&#8217;s written submission.  The Accounting Firm shall address only &#13;&#10;those items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item &#13;&#10;claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party.  &#13;&#10;Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having &#13;&#10;jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs &#13;&#10;and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Seller, on the one hand, and &#13;&#10;the Purchaser, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the &#13;&#10;disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such &#13;&#10;party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed &#13;&#10;items so submitted. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive &#13;&#10;and binding on the parties. &#13;&#10;(d) Access.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may not make &#13;&#10;an Indemnification Claim or deliver an Indemnification Claim Notice regarding Losses which it &#13;&#10;believes may arise from a claim by a third party (whether private or governmental) unless such &#13;&#10;third party has actually commenced a Proceeding, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the &#13;&#10;making of a claim by such third party against a Purchaser Indemnitee.

If the Purchaser and the &#13;&#10;Seller are still unable to reach agreement within forty-five (45) days after the first (1st) meeting &#13;&#10;with the mediator, then the dispute may only be submitted to, and settled by, an individual &#13;&#10;arbitrator mutually selected by the Seller and the Purchaser (if the Seller and the Purchaser are &#13;&#10;unable to agree upon the arbitrator, they shall each select an arbitrator and the two selected &#13;&#10;arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as the arbitrator).  The arbitration shall be held in &#13;&#10;New York, New York pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and in accordance with the then-&#13;&#10; prevailing International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The &#13;&#10;agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable, the award rendered by the arbitrator in &#13;&#10;respect of a dispute pursuant to this Section 7.6(a)(iii) shall be final and binding (absent fraud or &#13;&#10;manifest error), and any arbitration award may be enforced by judgment entered in any court of &#13;&#10;competent jurisdiction.

In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the &#13;&#10;defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 7.6(c), the &#13;&#10;Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and &#13;&#10;defense of such Third Party Claim.
