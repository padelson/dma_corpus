(the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Versum (the " _Versum Board_ ") has
unanimously (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (the " _Transactions_ "),

WHEREAS, that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 27,

Agreement by Versum;

WHEREAS, concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of such

WHEREAS, Versum, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, (a) at the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Versum in accordance with the DGCL and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) Versum
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Combined Company_ ") and (c) the Merger shall have such
other effects as provided in the DGCL.

 

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue,
New York, NY, at 9:00 a.m. (New York Time) on the fourth (4th) Business Day
following the day on which the last to be satisfied or (to the extent
permissible) waived of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing (so long as such conditions are reasonably capable of
being satisfied), but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permissible) waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or (to the extent
permissible) waived in accordance with this Agreement or at such other date,
time or place (or by means of remote communication) as Versum and Parent may
mutually agree in writing (the date on which the Closing actually occurs, the
" _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following, and on the date
of, the Closing, Versum and Parent will cause a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as
provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with and accepted by
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date and
time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II.

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

2.1 _Merger Consideration_ _; Conversion of Shares of Versum Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of Versum, each
share of Versum Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than Excluded Shares (such shares of Versum Common
Stock, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall automatically be converted into the
right to receive $53.00 per share in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Treasury Shares and Parent
Owned Shares shall, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Parties or any holder of such Treasury Shares and Parent Owned
Shares, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made
in respect of such shares.

 



-2- 

    

2.2 _Conversion of Shares_ _of Versum Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or any holder of any capital stock of Versum, all of the Eligible
Shares shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this  _Article_ __ _ II_, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account formerly representing any non-
certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement (including this _Article_ __ _ II_ and
_Article_ __ _ III_) shall affect the right of the holders of shares
of Versum Common Stock to receive any dividend or other distribution which
was declared on Versum Common Stock, and the record date of which occurred,
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

2.3 _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Combined Company.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards_. This _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall govern
the treatment of Versums equity awards in connection with the Transactions.

(a) _Versum Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Versum Common Stock granted under the Versum Prior Stock
Plan (each, a " _Versum Option_ ") shall be deemed fully vested and
exercisable, and each Versum Option shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Versum Option to receive (without interest), as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time through the payroll system
of the Combined Company, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Versum Common Stock subject to such
Versum Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _and_ (ii) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share
of Versum Common Stock of such Versum Option, less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Versum Option which has an exercise price per share of Versum Common Stock
that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 

(b) _RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding time vesting
restricted stock unit granted under the Versum Stock Plan (each, a " _Versum
RSU_ ") and under the Versum Prior Stock Plan (each, a " _Prior Plan Versum
RSU_ ") corresponding to shares of Versum Common Stock shall, in each case, be
canceled and converted into a right to receive a deferred cash payment (each,
a " _Converted_ _RSU Cash Award_ ") equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Versum Common Stock subject to such Versum RSU or Prior Plan
Versum RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _and_ (ii) the Merger
Consideration. Commencing on the Effective Time and through the date
immediately preceding the date such Converted RSU Cash Award vests, each
Converted RSU Cash Award corresponding to a Versum RSU shall accrue

 



-3- 

    

 interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, computed in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement evidencing such
Versum RSU. Each Converted RSU Cash Award covered by this _Section_ __ _
2.4(b)_ shall (A) vest and settle on terms (including acceleration events) at
least as favorable as were applicable to the corresponding Versum RSU or Prior
Plan Versum RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) vest in full
to the extent the holder of a Converted RSU Cash Award is subject to a Covered
Termination, with such Converted RSU Cash Award settled in cash as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, following
such Covered Termination, or such later time as required to comply with
Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) _Versum PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted
stock unit corresponding to shares of Versum Common Stock and subject to
performance-based vesting criteria, including market-based restricted stock
units and performance-based restricted stock units (each, a " _Versum PSU_ "),
shall be converted into a right to receive a deferred cash payment (each, a "
_Converted PSU Cash Award_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the number of shares of Versum Common Stock subject to such Versum PSU _and_
(ii) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of clause (i) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the number of shares of Versum Common Stock subject to a
Versum PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time shall equal the number of
Versum PSUs that would have vested pursuant to the terms of the applicable
award agreement if the applicable performance period ended immediately prior
to the Effective Time, based on actual performance through such truncated
period, as determined in the good faith discretion of the compensation
committee of the Versum Board (the " _Versum Compensation Committee_ ") (which
determination shall be effective as of the Effective Time). Commencing on the
Effective Time and through the date immediately preceding the date such
Converted PSU Cash Award vests in accordance with its terms, each Converted
PSU Cash Award covered by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ shall accrue interest
at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, computed in accordance with the
terms of the applicable award agreement evidencing such corresponding Versum
PSU. Each Converted PSU Cash Award covered by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_
shall (A) vest and settle on terms (including acceleration events) at least
as favorable as were applicable to the corresponding Versum PSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) vest in full to the extent the holder of a
Converted PSU Cash Award is subject to a Covered Termination, with such
Converted PSU Cash Award settled in cash as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days, following such Covered Termination,
or such later time as required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Versum Deferred Director Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
deferred stock unit (each, a " _Versum DSU_ ") held in a participants stock
account under the Versum Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the "
_Director Deferral Plan_ ") shall be fully vested and shall be converted into
the right to receive (without interest) cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Versum Common Stock covered by the
Versum DSUs held in such participants Director Deferral Plan stock account
_and_  (ii) the Merger Consideration, with such cash paid to such participant
no later than thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 

(e) _Versum Dividend Equivalent Rights_. Any Versum dividend equivalent
rights associated with any Versum RSU, Prior Plan Versum RSU, Versum PSU or
Versum DSU (collectively, the " _Versum Dividend Equivalents_ ") (i) credited
in the form of additional

 



-4- 

    

 Versum RSUs, Prior Plan Versum RSUs, Versum PSUs or Versum DSUs shall be
treated in the same manner as the award to which such dividend equivalent
rights relate in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and (ii) credited
in the form of cash shall be paid at the same time or times the award to which
such dividend equivalent rights relate is paid or settled in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, in each case, consistent with the terms of the
Versum Stock Plan, Versum Prior Stock Plan or other Versum Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Versum Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Versum and the
Versum Board (and the Versum Compensation Committee), as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate
the treatment of Versum Options, Versum RSUs, Prior Plan Versum RSUs, Versum
PSUs, Versum DSUs and Versum Dividend Equivalents (collectively, the "
_Versum Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ through
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_.

 

(g) _Future Grants of Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding anything in
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ through  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, to the extent the terms of any Versum
Equity Award (i) granted on or after the date of this Agreement and not in
violation of this Agreement or (ii) mutually agreed by the Parties and a
holder of any Versum Equity Award expressly provide for treatment in
connection with the occurrence of the Effective Time that is different from
the treatment prescribed by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, then in each case of
clause (i) and (ii), the terms of such Versum Equity Award, as applicable or
so agreed by the Parties and such holder, shall control (and the applicable
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall not apply); _provided_ ,
however, that in any event such awards will only entitle a holder to a fixed
cash payment after the Effective Time and will not entitle a holder to equity
in Parent.

 

ARTICLE III.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION; PROCEDURES FOR SURRENDER

3.1 _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, with an exchange agent selected
by Parent with Versums prior approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to serve as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Eligible
Shares, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an
aggregate amount of cash in U.S. Dollars sufficient to deliver the amounts
required to be delivered in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1_(being the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund may be deposited or invested by the Exchange
Agent as reasonably directed by Parent in obligations of or fully guaranteed
by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more
than thirty (30) days, or in funds or investment vehicles containing only such
obligations and cash; _provided_ , that no such deposit or investment (or any
loss resulting therefrom) shall affect the amount of cash payable to former
holders of Versum Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __
_ III_. To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any

 



-5- 

    

 reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to promptly pay the
cash amounts contemplated by this Agreement; or (C) all or any portion of the
Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Exchange Agent on behalf of
Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Agreement for
any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Combined Company to, promptly
replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and
maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payments
contemplated by this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from
such deposit may become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be promptly returned
to Parent.

 

3.2 _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(a) With respect to Certificates, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of each
such Certificate (i) a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (ii) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_) to the Exchange Agent or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC (each, a " _Non_ _-_ _DTC
Book-Entry Share_ ") to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Non-DTC
Book-Entry Shares) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (iii) instructions
for surrendering a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_) to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_) together with a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable (but in
any event within three (3) Business Days) in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_. Any Certificate that has
been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 

(b) With respect to Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within three (3) Business Days)
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Non-DTC Book-Entry Share (i) a notice advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a Letter of Transmittal
and (iii) instructions for transferring the Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Non-DTC Book-Entry
Shares by book-receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying
instructions, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within three
(3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_) that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 



-6- 

    

(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Versum and Parent
shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to
ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held
of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender
procedures, the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible
Shares pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ III_.

3.3 _No Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Versum of the shares of Versum Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Versum Common
Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Combined Company for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

3.4 _Termination of_ _Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any deposit of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed as of the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Eligible Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

3.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration payable or issuable pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _
III_, as if such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate had been surrendered.

 

3.6 _Appraisal_ _Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned
by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL, at which time such
Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.7_. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. Versum shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by Versum for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by Versum relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under
the DGCL. Versum

 



-7- 

    

 shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Combined
Company, the Exchange Agent and any other withholding agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Versum Common Stock and Versum
Equity Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Combined Company, the Exchange Agent or such other
withholding agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely
remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Combined Company, the Exchange Agent or
such other withholding agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Versum Common Stock and Versum Equity
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Combined Company, the Exchange Agent or such other withholding
agent, as applicable.

 

3.8 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_,
the issued and outstanding shares of Versum Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Versum Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or securities
or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, or a
stock dividend with a record date within such period shall have been declared,
then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the
holders of shares of Versum Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ shall be construed to
permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with,
and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement.

 

3.9 _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of
Versum Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger
of Versum, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange thereof
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Versum, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of Versum only if such Certificate is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 



-8- 

    

3.10 _No Liability_. None of Versum, Parent, the Combined Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash
that a holder of any Eligible Shares has the right to receive pursuant to
this  _Article_ __ _ III_ in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity, any
such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Versum has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of Versums
Organizational Documents, each as amended prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

 

5.2 _Subsidiaries_. _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ of the Versum Disclosure Letter

of its Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any Contract binding upon Versum or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Versum.

 

5.6 _Reports; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Versum has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, schedules, prospectuses, statements, certifications, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2017 (the " _Applicable
Date_ ") (the forms, schedules, prospectuses, statements, reports and
documents filed or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those
filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
including any amendments thereto, Versums " _Reports_ "). Each of Versums
Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively), complied, or if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (" _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and the rules and regulations
thereunder. As of their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then as of the date of such
filing), Versums Reports did not, and any of Versums Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. No Subsidiary of Versum is subject to periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act other than as part of Versums consolidated
group or required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC,
the NYSE, any other stock exchange or comparable Governmental Entity other
than routine and ordinary filings (such as filings regarding ownership
holdings or transfers).

 

(b) Versum is, and has been at all times since the Applicable Date, in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. Except as permitted by the
Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2)

 



-12- 

    

 and 13(k)(3) thereunder, or the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither Versum nor any of
its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any
extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer
or director of Versum.

 

(c) Since the Applicable Date, Versum has maintained disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Versum under the Exchange Act is
recorded and reported within the time periods specified in the Exchange Act
and all such information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the management of Versum, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(d) Versum is not a party to, and does not have any commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or any similar Contract
(including any Contract relating to any transaction, arrangement or
relationship between or among Versum, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand (such as any
arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure
of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Versum in
Versums consolidated financial statements.

 

(e) Versum maintains "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange
Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of such Party, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of Versum are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Versum, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Versums assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements. The records, systems, controls, data and
information of Versum and its Subsidiaries that are used in the systems of
disclosure controls and procedures and of financial reporting controls and
procedures described above are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Versum or
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Versum or its accountants, except as would not
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or disrupt, in any material
respect, Versums systems of disclosure controls and procedures and of
financial reporting controls and procedures or the reports generated thereby.

(f) Since the Applicable Date, none of Versums auditors, Versums board
of directors and the audit committee of the board of directors of Versum has
received any oral or written notification of (i) any "significant deficiency"
in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Versums ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for
Versums 

 



-13- 

    

 auditors, Versums board of directors and the audit committee of the board
of directors of Versum any "material weakness" in internal controls over
financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Versums
internal controls over financial reporting. Since the Applicable Date, no
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Versums employees
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by
Versum. Since the Applicable Date, no attorney representing Versum or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Versum or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws
or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Versum or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to Versums chief legal officer,
audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) pursuant to
the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or
Versums policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not
required by those rules.

5.7 _Financial Statements_. The financial statements of Versum included
in the Reports of Versum at the time filed (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of mailing, respectively) complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly present in all material
respects (subject in the case of unaudited statements to normal, recurring
audit adjustments which are not material, and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto and subject to restatements
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement) the consolidated
financial position of Versum and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended.

 

5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, except in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, Versum and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material respects in
the Ordinary Course.

 

(b) Since January 1, 2018, there has not been any Effect that has had or
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Versum.

5.9 _Litigation and Liabilities_.

 

(a) There are no Proceedings (other than arising from or relating to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
before any Governmental Entity pending against or, to the Knowledge of Versum,
threatened in writing against Versum or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective properties or assets, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) have a Material Adverse Effect
on Versum or (ii) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



-14- 

    

(b) Except for obligations and liabilities (i) reflected or reserved
against in Versums most recent consolidated balance sheets (or the notes
thereto) included in Versums Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) incurred in the Ordinary Course since the date of
Versums most recent consolidated balance sheets included in Versums Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or (iii) incurred in connection
with or contemplated by this Agreement, there are no obligations or

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger
Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Versums
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Versum
will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
consent of Parent or Merger Sub shall be required with respect to any matter
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the
extent that the requirement of such consent would, upon the advice of outside
antitrust legal counsel, violate applicable Antitrust Law. Nothing in this
Agreement, including any of the actions, rights or restrictions set forth
herein, will be interpreted in such a way as to require compliance by any
Party if such compliance would result in the violation of any rule, regulation
or policy of any applicable Law.

 

7.2 _Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation_. Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __
_ 7.2_, Versum shall not, and none of its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers and employees not to, and
not permit its investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors
or representatives to (such directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives,
collectively, " _Representatives_ "), directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information) or knowingly take any action designed to facilitate
any inquiry regarding, or the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal;

 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions with
or negotiations relating to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the
terms of this provision prohibit such discussions or negotiations);

(iii) provide any nonpublic information to any Person in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ to
the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Versum Vote is
obtained, in response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal received after the date of this Agreement (that did not arise from
or in connection with a breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 7.2_), Versum may:

 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor (including
nonpublic information regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries) to the Person
who made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such information has
previously been made available to, or is made available to, Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time such information is made available
to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such information, Versum
receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are generally not less
restrictive to the other party than the terms in the Confidentiality
Agreement are on Parent ( _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement need
not include any "standstill" terms), and which confidentiality agreement does
not prohibit compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_; and

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the Versum Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that, based on the information
then available and after consultation with its financial advisor, such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

(c) _Representatives_. Any violation of the restrictions contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2 _by any of Versums Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2 _by Versum. Versum shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 

(d) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. Versum shall promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours) give notice to Parent if (i) any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, (ii) any information is requested in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiations with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued
with, it or any of its Representatives, setting forth in such notice the name
of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (including, if applicable, complete copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a current basis (and, in any event, within twenty-
four (24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in its intentions as
previously notified.

 



-35- 

    

(e) _No Change of Recommendation_.

 

(i) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(f)_, the Versum Board, including any
committee thereof, agrees it shall not:

 

(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Versum Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent;

(B) fail to include the Versum Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

(C) fail to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by
its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for
outstanding shares of Versum Common Stock (other than by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent), in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier,
prior to the Versum Stockholders Meeting) (for the avoidance of doubt, the
taking of no position or a neutral position by the Versum Board in respect of
the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of
such period shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of any
such offer);

 

(D) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ entered into in compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ", and any of the actions set forth in
the foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), a " _Change of Recommendation_
"); or

 

(E) cause or permit Versum to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Versum Vote is obtained, if an
unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal received after the date
of this Agreement that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of
the obligations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ is received by Versum
and is not withdrawn, and the Versum Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Versum Board
may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation or (y) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_, in order to enter into a definitive
written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to taking such action described in clauses (x) or (y)
above, Versum has given Parent written notice of such action and the basis
therefor four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in
writing that the Versum Board intends to consider whether to take such action
(such notice, the " _Board Recommendation Notice_ ") and comply in form,
substance and delivery with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_. After
giving such Board Recommendation Notice and prior to taking any action
described in clauses (x) or (y) above, Versum shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would cause such Acquisition
Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal. At the end of the four (4)
Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to taking any action
described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Versum Board shall take into
account any changes to

 



-36- 

    

 the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and any other
information offered by Parent in response to the Board Recommendation Notice,
and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor that in the case of a Superior
Proposal, such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal, if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be
given effect. Any amendment to the financial terms and any other material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and this  _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(ii)_ and require a new Board Recommendation Notice, except that
references in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ to "four (4) Business Days"
shall be deemed to be references to "two (2) Business Days" and such two (2)
Business Day period shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on the second (2nd) Business
Day immediately following the day on which such new Board Recommendation
Notice is delivered (it being understood and agreed that in no event shall
any such additional two (2) Business Day period be deemed to shorten the
initial four (4) Business Day period).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Versum Vote is obtained, the Versum
Board may effect a Change of Recommendation (A) if an Intervening Event has
occurred, and (B) prior to taking such action, the Versum Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that failure to take such action in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that prior to making such Change of Recommendation, Versum has given Parent a
Board Recommendation Notice four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall comply in form, substance and delivery with the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and include a reasonably detailed description of such
Intervening Event. After giving such Board Recommendation Notice and prior to
effecting a Change of Recommendation, Versum shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement. At the end of the four (4) Business
Day period, prior to and as a condition to effecting a Change of
Recommendation, the Versum Board shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and any other
information offered by Parent in response to the Board Recommendation Notice,
and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor that (I) such Intervening Event
remains in effect and (II) the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law if
such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect.

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __
_ 7.2_ shall prohibit Versum from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable United States federal or state Law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ , _that_ , the
foregoing notwithstanding, Versum may not effect a Change of Recommendation
except in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(iii)_.

 

(g) _Existing Discussions_. Versum shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person

 



-37- 

    

 (including Entegris) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal. Versum shall promptly deliver a written notice to each
such Person providing only that Versum is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
proposal or transaction that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall also request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information concerning Versum and any of its
Subsidiaries heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Versum or
any of its Subsidiaries. Versum will promptly terminate all physical and
electronic data access previously granted to such Persons.

 

(h) _Standstill Provisions_. During the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_ and
the Effective Time, Versum shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which
Versum or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of
such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.

 

(i) _Further Actions_.

 

(i) Parent shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, as
soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one Business Day
after the date of this Agreement), (A) file an amendment to the Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO filed with the SEC by Parent on March 26, 2019 to
irrevocably withdraw and terminate the offer contemplated thereby, and (B)
withdraw the proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC by Parent on
March 22, 2019.

 

(ii) Versum shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, as

after the date of this Agreement), (A) terminate all solicitation efforts with
respect to the joint proxy statement/prospectus on Schedule 14A filed with the
SEC by Versum on March 20, 2019 and take all reasonable action to withdraw
such joint proxy statement/prospectus, and (B) cancel the special meeting of
Versums stockholders contemplated by the Entegris Agreement and provide
notice of such cancellation to Versum stockholders as required by Law or
reasonably requested by Parent.

7.3 _Proxy Statement Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Versum
shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the proxy statement relating
to the Versum Stockholders Meeting (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Versum shall use its reasonable best efforts
to respond promptly to comments from the SEC and, after the SEC staff advises
that it has no further comments thereon or that Versum may commence mailing
the Proxy Statement, to promptly thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of Versum. Versum shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of
all comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy

 



-38- 

    

 Statement or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will
furnish to Versum the information relating to it as required by the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
required by Versum.

(b) Each of Versum and Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to the stockholders of Versum and at the time of the Versum Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Versum will cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, either Party obtains knowledge of any information pertaining to it or
previously provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement that would
require any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that any of such
documents would not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
such Party shall promptly advise the other Party and the Parties shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by applicable Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
the Versum stockholders.

(c) Versum will provide legal counsel to Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy
Statement, responses to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, and
other documents related to the Versum Stockholders Meeting, prior to filing
such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such
documents to the stockholders of Versum. Versum will include in the Proxy
Statement and such other documents related to the Versum Stockholders Meeting
all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by Parent or its legal counsel
and each Party agrees that all information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content
satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ shall (i) not apply with
respect to information relating to a Change of Recommendation and (ii) in
respect of documents filed by Versum that are incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement, apply only with respect to the information relating to
Parent or Merger Sub or the business of Parent or Merger Sub.

 

7.4 _Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) Versum will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to convene the Versum
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the SEC staff advises
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that Versum may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement, to consider and vote upon the adoption
of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall not postpone

 



-39- 

    

 or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law, in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_, or if, as of the time for which the Versum
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Versum Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) and voting to adopt this Agreement or to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Versum
Stockholders Meeting. Versum shall, subject to the right of the Versum Board
to effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(iii)_, use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from the stockholders of Versum proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt this Agreement and to secure the Requisite Versum Vote (it being
understood that the foregoing shall not require the Versum Board to recommend
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if a Change of Recommendation has
been effected in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __
_ 7.2(e)(iii)_).

(b) Versum agrees (i) to provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic
updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis and (ii) to
give written notice to Parent one (1) day prior to the Versum Stockholders
Meeting and on the day of, but prior to the Versum Stockholders
Meeting, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies representing
the Requisite Versum Vote have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if, on a date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the date the Versum
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, (A) Versum has not received proxies
representing the Requisite Versum Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or
(B) it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is required to be delivered, Versum may, or if Parent so requests,
shall, postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of, the Versum Stockholders Meeting, as long as the date of the
Versum Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than ten (10)
days in connection with any one postponement or adjournment or to a date that
is no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
Versums right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.4(b)_, Versum agrees that its obligations to hold the Versum Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall not be affected by the
making of a Change of Recommendation by the Versum Board, and its obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall not be affected by the
commencement of or announcement or disclosure of or communication to Versum,
of any Acquisition Proposal (including any Superior Proposal) or the
occurrence or disclosure of an Intervening Event.

(d) The only matters to be voted upon at the Versum Stockholders Meeting
shall be the Requisite Versum Vote and routine proposals required in
connection with such vote.

 

7.5 _Cooperation; Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_), Versum and Parent shall cooperate with
each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use)
their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and to do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Law to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date)

practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable

later than the Outside Date) all actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
registrations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, approvals,
permits and authorizations (" _Consents_ ") necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Transactions, executing and delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and refraining from
taking any action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

all respects with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made
with, or submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions (including the Proxy Statement); provided,
however, that to the extent legally permissible and promptly following the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall determine whether filings are to be made
in individual European countries or with the European Commission, subject to
good faith consultation with Versum prior to taking any material substantive
positions with respect to a filing under the Council Regulation (EC) No.
139/2004 of the European Union. Neither Versum nor Parent shall permit any of
its officers or other Representatives to participate in any substantive
meeting, telephone call or conference with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any Filing, investigation or otherwise relating to the Transactions unless,
to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate therein. Each of the
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any Filing, other than confidential or proprietary
information not directly related to the Transactions, and to give the other
Party reasonable prior notice of any such Filing and, to the extent
practicable, keep the other Party reasonably informed with respect to the
status of each Consent sought from a Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions and the material communications between such Party and such
Governmental Entity, and, to the extent practicable, permit the other Party to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with any such Filing or communication. Each of the
Parties shall promptly furnish the other with copies of all correspondence,
Filings (except for the Parties initial HSR Act filings) and material
communications between them and their Affiliates and Representatives, on one
hand, and any such Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other
hand, with respect to the Transactions in order for such other Party to
meaningfully consult and participate in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
7.5_, _provided_ that materials furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns. Subject to applicable Law,
Versum and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or
conditions with respect to obtaining any Consent in connection with the
Transactions, and neither party shall directly or indirectly agree to extend
any applicable waiting period (including under the HSR Act) or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Entity related to this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case, without the prior written consent of the other
Party. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Versum and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 



-41- 

    

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ of the Versum Disclosure Letter,
neither Parent nor Versum shall, and each of them shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, take any action, including acquiring any asset, property,
business or Person (by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange, investment, other business combination, asset, stock or equity
purchase, or otherwise), in each case, that could reasonably be expected to
materially impair, adversely affect or materially delay obtaining or making
any Filing contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or the timely receipt
thereof.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_, but on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 7.5(e)_, each of Versum and
Parent agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

(i) subject to applicable Law, the prompt provision to each and every
federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law or Section 721
(each, a " _Governmental Antitrust or Security Entity_ ") of non-privileged
information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust or Security
Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the Transactions;

 

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take all reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable steps to (A) avoid the entry of, and (B)
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove any
actual, anticipated or threatened temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment
entered or issued, or that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or
issued, in any Proceeding or inquiry of any kind, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), that would reasonably be expected to
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make unlawful the
consummation of the Transactions, including (I) the defense through litigation
(excluding any appeals) on the merits of any claim asserted in any court,
agency or other Proceeding by any person or entity (including any
Governmental Antitrust or Security Entity) seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions and
(II) (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and agreeing to sell, lease,
license, divest or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such
disposition, (y) agreeing to restrictions or actions that after the Effective
Time would limit Parents or its Subsidiaries (including Versums) or
Affiliates freedom of action or operations with respect to, or its ability to
retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or
assets or (z) agreeing to enter into, modify or terminate existing
contractual relationships, contractual rights or contractual obligations, and
promptly effecting the sale, lease, license, divestiture, disposal and holding
separate of, assets, operations, rights, product lines, licenses, businesses
or interests therein of Versum or Parent or either of their respective
Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of,
the relevant Governmental Antitrust or Security Entity giving effect thereto
or to such restrictions or actions) (such sale, lease, license, defense
through litigation, divestiture, disposal and holding separate or other action
described in clauses (I) or (II), a " _Regulatory Remedy_ ") if such
Regulatory Remedy should be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable so as
to permit the consummation of the Transactions on a schedule as close as
possible to that contemplated herein. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_
shall require either Parent or Versum to effectuate or agree to effectuate
any Regulatory Remedy unless such Regulatory Remedy is conditioned upon the
Closing and only effective following the Closing.

 



-42- 

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ to the
contrary, neither this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ nor the "reasonable best efforts"
standard herein shall require, or be construed to require, (x) Versum or
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to (i)
waive any of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ as they apply
to such Party or (ii) take, effect or agree to any Regulatory Remedy unless
such Regulatory Remedy is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or
is effective on or after the Closing, or (y) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates to take, effect or agree to any Regulatory Remedy that
individually or in the aggregate with any other Regulatory Remedy to be
taken, effected or agreed to, would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of
operations of (A) Versum and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole from and
after the Effective Time, (B) Parent and its Subsidiaries (excluding Versum
and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole from and after the Effective Time,
treating for this purpose the effects of all Regulatory Remedies as if they
affected a company the size of, and having the financial and operating metrics
of, Versum and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including Versum and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole from
and after the Effective Time, treating for this purpose the effects of all
Regulatory Remedies as if they affected a company twice the size of, and
having financial and operating metrics twice the size of, Versum and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such effect described in clause (A),
(B) or (C), a " _Burdensome Effect_ "), it being understood that for purposes
of clause (iii) any proceeds received, or expected to be received,
from effecting a Regulatory Remedy shall not be taken into consideration in
making such determination.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, Versum and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with each other and work in good faith in

thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof (including any
Labor Organization), with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Versum Continuing

the Effective Time) director and officer of Versum or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Person who prior to or at the Effective Time served at the request of
Versum or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person

expenses), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any
Proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including in
connection with (i) this Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) actions to
enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party, and the Combined Company shall also advance expenses as

undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Versum shall and, if Versum is unable to,
Parent shall cause the Combined Company as of the Effective Time to, obtain
and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of

fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or

with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the insureds as Versums existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions). If Versum and the
Combined Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies
as of the Effective Time, the Combined Company shall continue to maintain in
effect for the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in Versums existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Combined Company shall

retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in Versums existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance exceed during
the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by Versum
for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Combined Company shall obtain a

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.13_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly
notify the Combined Company thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve the Combined Company of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any Proceeding: (i) the
Combined Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof ( _it_
_being_   _understood_ that by electing to assume the defense thereof, the
Combined Company will not be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Partys entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto or assumed any liability with respect thereto), except that if the
Combined Company elects not to assume such defense or legal counsel or the
Indemnified Party advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Combined Company and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party may retain legal counsel satisfactory to them, and the
Combined Company shall pay all reasonable and documented fees, costs and
expenses of such legal counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Combined
Company shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(c)_ to pay
for only one firm of legal counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties
would present such legal counsel with a conflict of interest ( _provided_ that
the fewest number of legal counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest
shall be used); (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter if the Combined Company elects to assume such defense, and
the Combined Company shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if the
Combined Company elects not to assume such defense; (iii) the Indemnified
Parties shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent if the Combined Company elects to assume such defense and the
Combined Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent the Combined Company elects not to assume such
defense; (iv) the Combined Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnified action of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law; and (v) all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such Proceedings shall continue until final
disposition of all such Proceedings.

(d) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Organizational Documents of
Versum and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and Versum or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
Transactions unchanged and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

(e) If the Combined Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Combined Company shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_.

 



-51- 

    

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this  _Section_ __ _
7.13_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and are in addition to any
rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Organizational Documents of
Versum or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any indemnification agreements or
other applicable Contracts of Versum or Laws.

(g) This _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and
from and after the Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, who shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_
__ _ 7.13_.

 

7.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions, each of Versum and the Versum Board,
respectively, shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary and legally permissible so that the Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

 

7.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Versum and the Versum Board (or duly formed
committees thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is
defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)),
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as are reasonably
necessary or appropriate to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions
of equity securities of Versum (including derivative securities) in connection
with the Transactions by any individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted
by applicable Laws.

 

7.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. Versum and Parent, as applicable, shall
promptly advise the other Party of any litigation commenced after the date

(b) Each of the Parties agrees that it shall bring any action
or Proceeding in respect of any claim arising under or relating to this

that the rights of each Party to consummate the Transactions are special,
unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or
damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other
available remedies a Party may have in equity or at Law, each Party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and to obtain an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened

10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto),
the Versum Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
March 29, 2019, between Versum and Parent (as amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, negotiations,
understandings and representations and warranties, whether oral or written,
with respect to such matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall remain in full force and effect until the Closing.

10.9 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Versum and Parent hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than
Parent, Merger Sub, Versum and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns any rights or remedies, express or
implied, hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, except with respect to (i) _ Section_
__ _ 7.13_ [ _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_
] and _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ [ _Financing Parties_ ] and (ii) after the
Effective Time, the provisions of _Article_ __ _ II_ relating to the payment
of the Merger Consideration which shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, holders of Versum Common Stock and Versum Equity Awards as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent necessary to receive the
consideration and amounts due to such Persons thereunder). The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 10.2_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

10.10 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires
a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Combined
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Versum to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Versum to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Any obligation of one Party to another Party
under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by
an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied
or fulfilled by such Party.

 



-74- 

    

10.11 _Non-Recourse_. Unless expressly agreed to otherwise by the Parties
in writing, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Proceeding in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise resulting from this Agreement,
any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions may only be brought against the Persons expressly named as
Parties and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such Party. No past, present or future director,
Employee (including any officer), incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, other equity holder or Persons in a similar capacity, controlling
person, Affiliate or other Representative of any Party or of any Affiliate of
any Party, or any of their respective successors, Representatives and
permitted assigns, shall have any liability or other obligation for any
obligation of any Party under this Agreement or for any Proceeding in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise resulting from this Agreement,
any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transactions.

 

10.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, insofar as may be legal, valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

 

10.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. All article,
section, subsection, schedule, annex and exhibit references used in this
Agreement are to articles, sections, subsections, schedules, annexes and
exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The exhibits, schedules
and annexes attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and
are incorporated herein for all purposes.

 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall
have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa. The words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including
without limitation," the words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and
similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not any particular section or article in which such words appear and any
reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall only be a
reference to such Law as of the date of this Agreement. Currency amounts
referenced herein are in U.S. Dollars.

 



-75- 

    

(c) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Whenever any action
must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such
action may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day.

 

(d) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP. 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

10.14 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors,
legal representatives and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its
rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, directly or indirectly, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; provided, _however_ , that Parent
may designate, by written notice to Versum, another wholly-owned direct or
indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in the Merger in lieu of
Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed
references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ , that
any such designation shall not (i) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder, (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or (iii) otherwise impede or impact the rights of the
stockholders of Versum under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void.

10.15 _Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, but in all cases subject to and without in any way limiting the
rights and claims of any Party and/or any of its Subsidiaries under and
pursuant to the Facilities Agreement or any other definitive agreement entered
into by such Party (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the other Party or
any of its Subsidiaries) with respect to any financing arrangements in
connection with the Merger (the " _Financing Documents_ "), each of Versum and
Parent, on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its controlled
Affiliates, hereby:

(a) agrees that any Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Entities, in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing Documents or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and
shall be brought and heard and determined exclusively in, any Federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or, if that
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court located
in the City and County of New York, and any appellate court thereof, __ and
each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to
any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts;

 



-76- 

    

(b) agrees that any such Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles
that would result in the application of the laws of another state), except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Financing Documents;

 

(c) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled
Affiliates to bring or support any Proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Entity in any way arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Financing Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
in any forum other than any Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or, if that court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in the City and County of New
York, and any appellate court thereof;

(d) agrees that service of process upon such Party, its Subsidiaries or
its controlled Affiliates in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice
is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.6_;

 

(e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do
so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
Proceeding in any such court;

(f) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any Proceeding brought against
the Financing Entities in any way arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Financing Documents or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder;

(g) agrees that none of the Financing Entities will have any liability to
Versum or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Financing
Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise;

 

(h) agrees that the Financing Entities are express third party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, this  _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ and any of
the provisions in this Agreement reflecting the agreements in this _Section_
__ _ 10.15_; and

 

(i) agrees that the provisions in this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ and the
definition of "Financing Entities" (and any other definition set forth in, or
any other provision of, this Agreement to the extent that an amendment, waiver
or other modification of such definition or other provision would amend, waive
or otherwise modify the substance of this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ or the
definition of "Financing Parties") shall not be amended, waived or otherwise
modified, in each case, in any way materially adverse to the rights of any
Lender (as defined in the Facilities Agreement) without the prior written
consent of such Lender (as defined in the Facilities Agreement) (and any such
amendment, waiver or other modification without such prior written consent
shall be null and void).
