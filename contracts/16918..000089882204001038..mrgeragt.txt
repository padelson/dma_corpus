                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "AGREEMENT") is made and
entered into as of the 3rd day of November, 2004, by and among Constellation
Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CONSTELLATION"), RMD Acquisition Corp., a
California corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation ("MERGER
SUB"), and The Robert Mondavi Corporation, a California corporation ("MONDAVI").


                                    RECITALS

          WHEREAS, Constellation and Mondavi desire that Constellation combine
its businesses with the businesses operated by Mondavi through the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Mondavi, with Mondavi as the surviving corporation (the
"MERGER"), pursuant to which (1) each share of Class A Common Stock of Mondavi,
without par value (the "MONDAVI CLASS A COMMON Stock") issued and outstanding at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), other than the shares of Mondavi
Class A Common Stock owned by Constellation, Merger Sub or Mondavi (or any of
their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (as defined in
Section 8.3)) and other than the Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section
2.1(d)), will be converted into the right to receive the Class A Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(b)), and (2) each share of Class B
Common Stock of Mondavi, without par value (the "MONDAVI CLASS B COMMON STOCK,"
and together with the Mondavi Class A Common Stock, the "MONDAVI COMMON STOCK")
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), other
than the shares of Mondavi Class B Common Stock owned by Constellation, Merger
Sub or Mondavi (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.3)) and other than the Appraisal Shares
(as defined in Section 2.1(d)), will be converted into the right to receive the
Class B Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(b)), all as more fully
provided in this Agreement; and

          WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Constellation's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Constellation and certain Mondavi Shareholders (as defined in Section
1.6(a)) are entering into a Support Agreement, of even date herewith, in respect
of shares of Mondavi Common Stock beneficially owned by such shareholders (the
"SUPPORT AGREEMENT"); and

          WHEREAS, the Board of each of Merger Sub and Mondavi has
determined that the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement is just and reasonable to their respective
shareholders; and

          WHEREAS, Constellation, Merger Sub and Mondavi desire to make
those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein
in connection with this Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
Constellation, Merger Sub and Mondavi agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

          1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the California General
Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Mondavi
at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Mondavi shall continue its existence as
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation under the laws of the State of
California and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of
Merger Sub in accordance with the CGCL. Mondavi, in its capacity as the
corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION."

          1.2. CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. A closing (the "CLOSING") shall be held
at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York,
N.Y. 10019, or such other place as the parties hereto may agree, as soon as
practicable following the date upon which all conditions set forth in Article VI
that are capable of being satisfied prior to the date of the Closing have been
satisfied or waived, or at such other date as Constellation and Mondavi may
agree (such date, the "CLOSING DATE"). As promptly as possible on the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of California (the "CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF
STATE") an agreement of merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"MERGER AGREEMENT") and officer's certificates in such form as is required by
and executed in accordance with Section 1103 of the CGCL. The Merger shall
become effective when the Merger Agreement is properly filed with the California
Secretary of State in accordance with the CGCL or at such later time as may be
specified in the Merger Agreement (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

          1.3. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1107 of the CGCL.

          1.4. ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS.

          (a) The Articles of Incorporation of Mondavi, as amended as set forth
in the Merger Agreement, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until amended in accordance with their terms and the CGCL.

          (b) Merger Sub's Bylaws in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Surviving Corporation's Bylaws, until amended in accordance
with their terms, the Articles of Incorporation and the CGCL.

          1.5. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. From and
after the Effective Time, the officers of Mondavi shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified.

          1.6. MONDAVI SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING.

          (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Mondavi shall, in accordance with Applicable Laws (as defined in
Section 2.2(d)) and Mondavi's Restated Articles of Incorporation as in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the "MONDAVI ARTICLES") and Mondavi's Restated
Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "MONDAVI BYLAWS"), duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of shares of
Mondavi Common Stock (the "MONDAVI SHAREHOLDERS") to consider and vote upon
approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "MONDAVI SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING").
Mondavi shall ensure that the Mondavi Shareholders' Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Mondavi in
connection with the Mondavi Shareholders' Meeting are solicited by Mondavi in
compliance with Applicable Laws.

          (b) Mondavi shall promptly prepare and file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") a proxy statement (together with any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "PROXY STATEMENT") that meets the
requirements of Applicable Laws to seek the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger. Mondavi shall respond promptly to any comments made by the Commission
with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary version thereof filed by
it and shall cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Mondavi Shareholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable. Mondavi shall promptly notify
Constellation of the receipt of any comments of the Commission with respect to
the Proxy Statement and shall provide to Constellation copies of any comments
received from the Commission in connection with the Proxy Statement. All filings
with the Commission in connection with the Merger, including the Proxy
Statement, and all mailings to the Mondavi Shareholders in connection with the
Merger, including the Proxy Statement, shall be subject to the prior review and
comment by Constellation and its counsel, and shall be reasonably acceptable to
Constellation.

          (c) The Mondavi Board shall make the Mondavi Board Recommendation (as
defined in Section 4.20). The Mondavi Board Recommendation shall be included in
the Proxy Statement and the Mondavi Board shall take all commercially reasonable
action to solicit the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Mondavi
Shareholders. In the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the
Mondavi Board determines after consultation with outside counsel that its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law require it to withdraw, modify or qualify
the Mondavi Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Constellation, the
Mondavi Board may so withdraw, modify or qualify the Mondavi Board
Recommendation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Mondavi Board may not recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3(b)(viii)(A)) (other than this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger),
except as specifically contemplated by, and in accordance with, Section
5.3(b)(iii); PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that unless this Agreement is
theretofore terminated, Mondavi shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the
Mondavi Shareholders for adoption at the Mondavi Shareholders' Meeting.

          1.7. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to
(a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties


                                      -3-
<PAGE>


or assets of Mondavi or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, Mondavi and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have
granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute
and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all
acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of Mondavi or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

          2.1. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Constellation, Merger Sub or
Mondavi or their respective shareholders:

          (a) Each share of common stock, without par value, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, WITHOUT
par value, of the Surviving Corporation ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON STOCK").
Such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and
outstanding Surviving Corporation capital stock, except insofar as Section
2.1(c)(i) applies.

          (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II:

              (i) Each share of Mondavi Class A Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding any shares of
Mondavi Class A Common Stock owned by Constellation, Merger Sub or Mondavi or
any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries (which shares shall be treated
as otherwise provided in this Agreement) and any shares of Mondavi Class A
Common Stock owned by shareholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 1300 of the CGCL ("SECTION 1300"), as provided in Section 2.1(d),
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive $56.50 in cash,
without interest (the "CLASS A MERGER CONSIDERATION"). At the Effective Time,
all shares of Mondavi Class A Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares
of Mondavi Class A Common Stock (a "CLASS A CERTIFICATE") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Class A Merger
Consideration or in the case of holders of Appraisal Shares (as defined in
Section 2.1(d)) the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in
Section 2.1(d).

              (ii) Each share of Mondavi Class B Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding any shares of
Mondavi Class B Common Stock owned by Constellation, Merger Sub or Mondavi or
any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries (which shares shall be treated
as otherwise provided in this Agreement) and any shares of Mondavi Class B
Common Stock owned by shareholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 1300, as provided in Section 2.1(d), shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive $65.82 in cash, without interest (the "CLASS B


                                      -4-
<PAGE>


MERGER CONSIDERATION," and together with the Class A Merger Consideration, the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION"). At the Effective Time, all shares of Mondavi Class B
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of Mondavi Class B Common
Stock (a "CLASS B CERTIFICATE," and, together with the Class A Certificates, the
"CERTIFICATES") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Class B Merger Consideration or in the case of holders of
Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)) the right to receive the
applicable payments set forth in Section 2.1(d).

          (c) Each share of Mondavi capital stock held by Constellation or any
wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation, automatically shall be cancelled and
retired and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. Each share of Mondavi
Class B Common Stock held by any wholly-owned subsidiary of Mondavi shall, at
Constellation's election, either (i) be converted into such number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock such that each such wholly-owned subsidiary
owns the same percentage (in terms of economic value) of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock immediately following the Effective Time as the percentage (in
terms of economic value) of Mondavi Common Stock that such wholly-owned
subsidiary owned immediately prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that this clause (i) shall not apply unless the Mondavi Class B Shareholders
unanimously consent to such treatment of the shares of Mondavi Class B Common
Stock held by all wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mondavi, (ii) automatically be
cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in respect thereof, or (iii)
be converted into the right to receive the Class B Merger Consideration.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
shares of Mondavi Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any Mondavi Shareholder that is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of shares of Mondavi Common Stock pursuant
to, and that complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 1300 (the
"APPRAISAL SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Class A
Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, as
provided in Section 2.1(b), but, instead, such Mondavi Shareholder shall be
entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 1300.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Mondavi Shareholder shall fail to
validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 1300 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such Mondavi Shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided
by Section 1300, then the rights of such Mondavi Shareholder under Section 1300
shall cease, and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Class A
Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, as
provided in Section 2.1(b) without interest. Mondavi shall give prompt notice to
Constellation of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Mondavi Common
Stock, and Constellation shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, Mondavi shall not, without the prior written consent of
Constellation, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

          2.2. SURRENDER AND PAYMENT.

          (a) Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Mondavi
Shareholders, Constellation shall designate, or shall cause to be designated
(pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Constellation), a bank or trust company to act as agent for the payment of the
Class A Merger Consideration and the Class B Merger Consideration in respect of
the Class A Certificates and the Class B Certificates upon surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the
Effective Time (the "PAYING AGENT"). At the Effective Time, Constellation shall
deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount
sufficient for the payment of the Class A Merger Consideration and the Class B
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) upon surrender of such
Certificates (such cash, the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Constellation, on a daily
basis. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income
resulting from investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to
the Mondavi Shareholders twelve months after the date of the mailing required by
Section 2.2(b) shall be delivered to Constellation, upon demand by
Constellation, and holders of Certificates that have not theretofore complied
with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Constellation for payment of
any claim to the Class A Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger
Consideration, as applicable.

          (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event within five business days after the Effective
Time), the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Mondavi
Shareholder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions
as Constellation may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Class A Merger
Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Constellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which
the shares of Mondavi Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Mondavi Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of
Mondavi, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered
if the Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
Taxes (as defined in Section 4.11(c)) required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Constellation that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.

          (c) STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the close of business on the day on which
the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Mondavi shall be closed,
and there shall be no


                                      -6-
<PAGE>


further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Mondavi Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

          (d) NO LIABILITY. None of Constellation, Merger Sub, Mondavi or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. All funds held by the Paying Agent for payment to the holders of
unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Constellation, after which time any holder of unsurrendered
Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Constellation for payment
of the funds to which the holder of unsurrendered Certificates may be due,
subject to Applicable Laws. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to seven years after the Effective Time, any such cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or
guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any
Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.3(d)), in each case, to the
extent applicable (collectively, "APPLICABLE LAWS"), become the property of
Constellation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

          (e) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Constellation or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as Constellation or the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of the
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Class A Merger Consideration or the
Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable.

          (f) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN MONDAVI COMMON STOCK. The Class A
Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates that
have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Mondavi Common Stock represented thereby.

          (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Constellation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any Mondavi Shareholders such amounts as it may be required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or Constellation, as the case may be, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Mondavi Shareholders in respect of which the deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation or Constellation, as the case may be.


                                      -7-

          2.3. TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS; EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

          (a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase a share of Mondavi
Class A Common Stock (a "MONDAVI OPTION") granted under the Mondavi 1993
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and the Mondavi 1993 Equity Incentive
Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive (whether or not such Mondavi Option is then vested or exercisable),
promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (less any applicable
withholding taxes and without interest) equal to the product of (i) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Class A Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise
price of Mondavi Class A Common Stock subject to such Mondavi Option and (ii)
the number of shares of Mondavi Class A Common Stock subject to such Mondavi
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. In connection therewith, at
least five business days prior to the Effective Time, Mondavi shall provide
written notice to each holder of a then outstanding Mondavi Option (whether or
not such Mondavi Option is then vested or exercisable), that (x) such Mondavi
Option shall be, as at the date of such notice, exercisable in full, (y) such
Mondavi Option shall terminate at the Effective Time and (z) if such Mondavi
Option is not exercised on or before the third business day prior to the
Effective Time, such Mondavi Option (to the extent outstanding as of the
Effective Time) shall be treated as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence.

          (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, all stock units in respect of
Mondavi Class A Common Stock or other equity-based awards settled in or the
value of which is measured by reference to Mondavi Class A Common Stock (other
than the Mondavi Options) (each a "MONDAVI STOCK UNIT AWARD") shall be converted
into an obligation to pay cash, with a value equal to the product of (i) the
Class A Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Mondavi Class A
Common Stock subject to such Mondavi Stock Unit Award (whether vested or
unvested). The obligations in respect of the converted Mondavi Stock Unit Awards
shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or
arrangement relating to such Mondavi Stock Unit Awards.

          (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Mondavi shall take any and all
actions with respect to Mondavi's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") as
are necessary to provide that (i) with respect to the Purchase Period (as
defined in the ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement, no employee who
is not a participant in the ESPP as of the date hereof may become after the date
hereof a participant in the ESPP and no participant in the ESPP may increase the
percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect
on the date hereof for such Purchase Period; (ii) subject to consummation of the
Merger, the ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately before the Effective
Time; and (iii) if the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in effect as of
the date of this Agreement terminates prior to the Stock Plan Termination Date
(as defined in the following sentence), the ESPP shall be suspended and no new
Purchase Period will be commenced under the ESPP prior to the termination of
this Agreement. Subject to consummation of the Merger, if such Purchase Period
is expected to still be in effect at the Effective Time, then no later than the
last day of the payroll period immediately preceding the Effective Time (the
"STOCK PLAN TERMINATION DATE"), each purchase right under the ESPP as of the
Stock Plan Termination Date shall be automatically exercised by applying the
payroll deductions of each participant in the ESPP for such Purchase Period to
the purchase of a number of whole shares of Mondavi Class A Common Stock
(subject to the


                                      -8-
<PAGE>


provisions of Mondavi's ESPP regarding the number of shares purchasable) at a
"purchase price" (as such term is used in the ESPP) per share equal to 85% of
the Fair Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) of a share of Mondavi Class A
Common Stock on the Offering Date (as defined in the ESPP) or on the Stock Plan
Termination Date, whichever is lower.

          (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Mondavi shall ensure that following
the Effective Time no holder of a Mondavi Option or any participant in any Plan
or other employee benefit arrangement of Mondavi shall have any right thereunder
to acquire or receive any capital stock (including payment of cash in settlement
of any unit award, "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of Mondavi or
the Surviving Corporation, except as expressly provided in Section 2.3(b) of
this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Mondavi shall deliver to the
holders of Mondavi Options, holders of Mondavi Stock Unit Awards and
participants in the ESPP appropriate notices, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Constellation, setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to this
Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Mondavi shall take any and all actions
necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.3, including the adoption of
any plan amendments.

          2.4. ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION. In the event that Mondavi
changes the number of shares of Mondavi Common Stock, or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Mondavi Common Stock, issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other
similar transaction, the Class A Merger Consideration and the Class B Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

     encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of Constellation or any of
     its subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any

<PAGE>


except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above for any of the foregoing
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3) on Constellation.

          3.4. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Constellation or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy
Statement is mailed to the Mondavi Shareholders or at the time of the Mondavi
Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary, in order
to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

          3.5. AVAILABLE FUNDS. Constellation and Merger Sub have available to
them, or, as of the Effective Time will have available to them, all funds

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MONDAVI

          In order to induce Merger Sub and Constellation to enter into this
Agreement, except as set forth in the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule as set forth
below, Mondavi hereby represents and warrants to Constellation and Merger Sub
that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct. The
section numbers in the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule correspond to the section
numbers in this Agreement. Information disclosed in one section of the Mondavi
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be integrated into another section of
the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule unless its applicability is readily apparent.

          4.1. ORGANIZATION AND STANDING. Mondavi is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of California with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and
operate its properties and to conduct its business as and where now owned,

organization, as the case may be, with full corporate power (if applicable) and
authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its
business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted. Each of
Mondavi and its subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so qualify, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in such jurisdiction
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably


                                      -11-
<PAGE>


be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mondavi. Mondavi is not in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of the
Mondavi Articles or the Mondavi Bylaws. Mondavi has heretofore made available to
Constellation complete and correct copies of the Mondavi Articles and the
Mondavi Bylaws and the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents for each of Mondavi's subsidiaries.

          4.2. SUBSIDIARIES. Mondavi does not own, directly or indirectly, any
equity or other material ownership interest in any material corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other entity or enterprise, except for the
subsidiaries set forth on Schedule 4.2 of the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2 of the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule, Mondavi
is not subject to any obligation or requirement to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
such entity or any other person. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2 of the
Mondavi Disclosure Schedule, Mondavi owns, directly or indirectly, each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such subsidiary) of each of its
material subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
of Mondavi's subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by Mondavi free and clear
of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or other encumbrances, other
than as indicated on Schedule 4.2 of the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule. There are
no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements,
understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to
the issuance, sale or transfer of any securities of any of Mondavi's
subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any securities that are convertible into
or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests of any of Mondavi's subsidiaries, other than as indicated on
Schedule 4.2 of the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule.

          4.3. CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. Mondavi has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, subject to approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Mondavi
Shareholders, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution, performance and delivery of this Agreement by Mondavi have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Mondavi, subject to
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the Mondavi Shareholders and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Mondavi are necessary to authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Mondavi, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Constellation and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Mondavi enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except that such enforceability (a) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) is subject to general
principals of equity.

          4.4. CAPITALIZATION OF MONDAVI.

          (a) As of the date hereof, Mondavi's authorized capital stock
consisted solely of (i) 25,000,000 shares of Mondavi Class A Common Stock, of
which (A) 10,816,581 shares are


                                      -12-
<PAGE>


issued and outstanding, (B) 1,492,302 shares are reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of all outstanding Mondavi Options, (C) 75,689 shares are reserved for
issuance upon settlement of Mondavi Stock Unit Awards or other stock based
awards, and (D) 5,984,927 shares are reserved for issuance upon the conversion
of shares of Mondavi Class B Common Stock; (ii) 12,000,000 shares of Mondavi
Class B Common Stock, of which 5,984,927 shares are issued and outstanding,
including 214,209 shares of Class B Common Stock owned by Robert Mondavi
Properties, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mondavi; and (iii) 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, without par value, of which no shares are issued and
outstanding or reserved for future issuance under any agreement, arrangement or
understanding. As of the date hereof, there are outstanding Mondavi Options to
purchase an aggregate of 1,492,302 shares of Mondavi Class A Common Stock and
Mondavi Stock Unit Awards with respect to 75,689 shares of Mondavi Class A
Common Stock.

          (b) Other than as set forth in Section 4.4(a) of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding (i) shares of Mondavi capital stock or Mondavi voting
securities, (ii) subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements,
understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to
the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer of any securities of Mondavi, or
(iii) securities or other instruments that are convertible into or exchangeable
for any shares of Mondavi capital stock or Mondavi voting securities or the
value of which are determined based on the value of Mondavi capital stock, and
neither Mondavi nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind to
issue any additional securities or to pay for, repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any securities of Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors.

          (c) None of Mondavi's subsidiaries owns any capital stock of Mondavi,
except that Robert Mondavi Properties, Inc. owns 214,209 shares of Mondavi Class
B Common Stock. Each outstanding share of Mondavi capital stock is, and each
share of Mondavi capital stock that may be issued will be, when issued, duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to
any preemptive or similar rights. Section 4.4 to the disclosure schedule
delivered by Mondavi to Constellation and dated the date of this Agreement (the
"MONDAVI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") states the number of shares of Mondavi Class A
Common Stock issuable to each holder of Mondavi Options as of the date of this
Agreement, including the applicable exercise price and whether the Mondavi
Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" (within the meaning
of Section 422 of the Code). Section 4.4 to the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule
accurately sets forth the names of all holders of Mondavi capital stock subject
to transfer restrictions, including the number of shares of each class of
Mondavi capital stock held by that holder. Neither Mondavi nor any of its
subsidiaries has agreed to register any securities under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"SECURITIES ACT") or under any state securities law or granted registration
rights to any individual or entity.

          4.5. CONFLICTS; CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will:

          (a) conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, the
     Mondavi Articles or the Mondavi Bylaws;


                                      -13-
<PAGE>


          (b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision
     of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with the giving of notice,
     the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default) under, or
     entitle any person (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
     otherwise) to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or
     result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or
     encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of Mondavi or any of its
     subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
     bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, contract, undertaking,
     agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which Mondavi or any
     of its subsidiaries is a party;

          (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
     regulation applicable to Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
     respective properties or assets; or

          (d) require any action or consent or approval of, or review by, or
     registration or filing by Mondavi or any of its affiliates with, any third

     Laws, (iii) registrations or other actions required under United States
     federal and state securities laws, and (iv) the filing with the California
     Secretary of State of the Merger Agreement;

other than, in the case of Sections 4.5(b), 4.5(c) and 4.5(d), those exceptions
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mondavi.

          4.6. BROKERAGE AND FINDERS' FEES; EXPENSES. Except for Mondavi's
obligations to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Evercore Group Inc. (true and
complete copies of all agreements relating to such obligations having been
previously provided to Constellation), neither Mondavi nor any shareholder,
director, officer, employee or affiliate of Mondavi, has incurred or will incur
on behalf of Mondavi or its subsidiaries, any brokerage, finders', advisory or
similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          4.7. MONDAVI SEC DOCUMENTS.

          (a) Mondavi and its subsidiaries have timely filed with the Commission
all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, schedules, statements
and other documents required to be filed by them since July 1, 2002 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "EXCHANGE ACT") or the Securities Act
(as supplemented and amended since the time of filing, collectively, the
"MONDAVI SEC DOCUMENTS"). The Mondavi SEC Documents, including any financial
statements or schedules included in the Mondavi SEC Documents, at the time filed
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates
of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in the case of any
Mondavi SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding filing) (i) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>


circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, as the case may be. The financial statements of Mondavi and
its subsidiaries included in the Mondavi SEC Documents (i) have been prepared
from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Mondavi and its
subsidiaries, (ii) at the time filed (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of
mailing, respectively, and, in the case of any Mondavi SEC Document amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such amending or superseding filing) complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto, (iii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission), and (iv) fairly present (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments) the
consolidated financial position of Mondavi and its consolidated subsidiaries as
at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows (and changes in financial position, if any) for the periods then ended.
None of Mondavi's subsidiaries is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act or required to file any form, report or other document with
the Commission, The Nasdaq National Market, any stock exchange or any other
comparable Governmental Authority.

          (b) With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K and each Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q included in the Mondavi SEC Documents filed since August 29,
2002, the financial statements and other financial information included in such
reports fairly present (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring audit adjustments) in all material respects the financial condition
and results of operations of Mondavi as of, and for, the periods presented in
the Mondavi SEC Documents. Since August 29, 2002, Mondavi's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to Mondavi's auditors
and the audit committee of the Mondavi Board (i) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Mondavi's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Mondavi's internal control over financial
reporting and Mondavi has provided to Constellation copies of any written
materials relating to the foregoing. Mondavi has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to Mondavi, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to Mondavi's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during
the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared; and, to the knowledge of Mondavi, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Mondavi's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in Mondavi's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. There
are no outstanding loans made by Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries to any
executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director
of Mondavi. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, neither
Mondavi nor any of its subsidiaries has made any loans to


                                      -15-
<PAGE>


any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries.

          4.8. UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (a) as and to the extent
disclosed or reserved against on the balance sheet of Mondavi as of June 30,
2004 included in the Mondavi SEC Documents, or (b) as incurred after the date
thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice and
not prohibited by this Agreement, neither Mondavi nor any of its subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether known or unknown,
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet
of Mondavi and its subsidiaries (or disclosed in the notes thereto).

          4.9. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. At the date the Proxy Statement is mailed
to the Mondavi Shareholders and at the time of the Mondavi Shareholders'
Meeting, the Proxy Statement will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary, in order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The representation contained in the
immediately preceding sentence will not apply to statements or omissions
included in the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to Mondavi by
Constellation or Merger Sub specifically for use therein. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act.

          4.10. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since June 30, 2004, (a)
except as disclosed in the Mondavi SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof
(other than in the risk factors or forward-looking statements), there has not
been any Material Adverse Effect on Mondavi or any event, change, effect or
development that would, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mondavi, (b) except as disclosed
in the Mondavi SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (other than in the
risk factors or forward-looking statements) the business of Mondavi and its

were true, correct and complete in all material respects. Mondavi and each of
its subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid all material Taxes in respect of
the periods covered by such material Tax Returns shown as due and payable on
such material Tax Returns. Each of Mondavi and its subsidiaries has timely
withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent
contractor, shareholder or other third party. Neither Mondavi nor any of its
subsidiaries (i) has been a member of a group filing consolidated returns for
federal income Tax purposes (except for the group of which Mondavi is the common
parent), (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Mondavi
and its subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar

                                      -16-
<PAGE>


sharing or Tax indemnity agreement or any other agreement of a similar nature
involving a material amount of Taxes that remains in effect. Neither Mondavi nor
any of its subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this
Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation in the two (2) years prior to
the Closing Date) or (ii) in a distribution that otherwise constitutes part of a
"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e)
of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.

          (b) "TAX RETURNS" means returns, reports and forms required to be
filed with any Governmental Authority of the United States or any other
jurisdiction responsible for the imposition or collection of Taxes.

          (c) "TAXES" means (i) all taxes (whether United States federal, state
or local or foreign) based upon or measured by income and any other tax
whatsoever, including gross receipts, profits, sales, use, occupation, value
added, AD VALOREM, transfer, franchise, withholding, payroll, employment,
excise, or property taxes, together with any interest or penalties imposed with
respect thereto and (ii) any obligations under any agreements or arrangements
with respect to any taxes described in clause (i) above.

          4.12. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

          (a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT"
means any trademark, service mark, trade name, mask work, invention, patent,
trade secret, copyright, know-how or proprietary information contained on any
website, processes, formulae, products, technologies, discoveries, apparatus,
Internet domain names, trade dress and general intangibles of like nature
(together with goodwill), customer lists, confidential information, licenses,
software, databases and compilations including any and all collections of data
and all documentation thereof (including any registrations or applications for
registration of any of the foregoing) or any other similar type of proprietary
intellectual property right, and (ii) "MONDAVI INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT"
means all Intellectual Property Rights owned or licensed by Mondavi or any of
its subsidiaries as of the date hereof that are used or held for use by Mondavi
or any of its subsidiaries.

          (b) Mondavi and its subsidiaries own, or are validly licensed or
otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual Property Rights used in the
conduct of their businesses, except where the failure to own or possess valid
rights to such Intellectual Property Rights would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Mondavi. No Mondavi Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding
judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the use thereof by
Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries or restricting the licensing thereof by
Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries to any Person (as defined in Section
5.3(b)(i)), except for any judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mondavi. Neither Mondavi nor any
of its subsidiaries is infringing on any other Person's Intellectual Property
Rights and to the knowledge of Mondavi no Person is infringing on any Mondavi
Intellectual Property Rights, except, in either case, as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material


                                      -17-
<PAGE>


Adverse Effect on Mondavi. Except for such matters as would not, individually or

defendant in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding relating to, or
otherwise was notified of, any claim alleging infringement of any Intellectual
Property Right and (ii) Mondavi and its subsidiaries have no claim or suit

Intellectual Property Rights.

or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability thereunder; (vi) no Mondavi

Mondavi, nor is there any judgment, award, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator outstanding against Mondavi or any of

          The parties hereto agree that:

          5.1. MUTUAL COVENANTS.

          (a) REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Mondavi and Constellation will use their reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement or Applicable Law to

any Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain all such consents, waivers, licenses, registrations,
permits, authorizations, orders and approvals. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of Mondavi and Constellation agrees to make all necessary
filings in connection with any approvals, filings consents, orders or waiting

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mondavi or Constellation

to use its reasonable efforts to furnish or cause to be furnished, as promptly
as practicable, all information and documents requested with respect to such
Approvals and shall otherwise cooperate with the applicable Governmental
Authorities in order to obtain any Approvals in as expeditious a manner as
possible. Each of Mondavi and Constellation shall use its reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Authority may assert with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in connection
with the Approvals. In the event that a suit is instituted by a Person or
Governmental Authority challenging this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of applicable antitrust or competition laws,

          5.2. COVENANTS OF CONSTELLATION.

          (a) INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE.

              (i) For six years from and after the Effective Time, to the
       fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Constellation shall cause the
       Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the present and
       former officers and directors of Mondavi in respect of acts or omissions
       occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in
       connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
       contemplated hereby) to the extent required under the Mondavi Articles or
       the Mondavi Bylaws; and

              (ii) Constellation shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
       Constellation to obtain and maintain in effect, for a period of six years
       after the Effective Time, policies of directors' and officers' liability

       currently covered by Mondavi's directors' and officers' liability
       insurance policy with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
       Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with this
       Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
       with substantially the same coverage and containing substantially similar
       terms and conditions as existing policies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the
       aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such
       period shall exceed 150% of the per annum rate of premium paid by Mondavi

       Constellation shall or shall cause its subsidiaries to, provide only such
       coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium equal to 150% of

          (b) EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

              (i) Constellation will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor
the accrued and vested obligations of Mondavi and any of its subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time under the provisions of all Mondavi Benefit Plans and
employment agreements to which Mondavi is a party, PROVIDED that this provision
shall not prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending, suspending or
terminating any such Mondavi Benefit Plans or employment agreements to the
extent permitted by the applicable terms of such Plan or employment agreement.

              (ii) Constellation expects to provide Mondavi Employees with
health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
health and welfare benefits currently provided by Constellation to its similarly
situated employees. Until Mondavi Employees are transferred to such
Constellation-based program (such Mondavi Employees, until such transfer,
"NON-TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES"), Constellation will provide Non-Transferred
Employees with health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the health and welfare benefits currently provided by Mondavi to
such Mondavi Employees. For purposes of this Section 5.2(b), "MONDAVI EMPLOYEES"
means individuals who are, as of the Effective Time, employees of Mondavi not
subject to collective bargaining agreements and who following the Effective Time
continue such employment with Mondavi, Constellation or their respective
subsidiaries. Constellation will also take the action described on Schedule
5.2(b)(ii).

Shareholders at the Mondavi Shareholders' Meeting, (A) providing information in
response to a request therefor by, or engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with, a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that is not made in violation of Section 5.3(b)(i) if the
Mondavi Board receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on
customary terms; or (B) recommending such an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal to the Mondavi Shareholders, if and only to the extent
that, (1) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Mondavi
Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their
respective fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (2) in the case of clause (A)
above, the Mondavi Board determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors that it is likely that such
Acquisition Proposal would constitute a Superior Proposal; and (3) in the case
of clause (B) above, the Mondavi Board determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal (in the form, other than immaterial changes, that was the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice, as defined below) constitutes a
Superior Proposal and Constellation shall have received written notice (the
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL NOTICE") of Mondavi's intention to take the action referred
to in clause (B) at least four business days prior to the taking of such action
by Mondavi (the "WAITING PERIOD"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Mondavi Board
continues to believe, after taking into account any modifications to the terms
of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by
Constellation after its receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice (with respect to
which modifications Mondavi and Constellation shall endeavor to negotiate in
good faith), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. If
the Mondavi Board recommends an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to clause (B) above, Constellation shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a) of the Agreement.

              (iv) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.3(b)(iv),
Mondavi agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the
parties hereto) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Mondavi agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
officers, directors, employees and Representatives of Mondavi and its
subsidiaries of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3(b). Mondavi also
agrees promptly, but in any event, within five days after the date of this
Agreement, to request the return or destruction of all information and materials
provided (to any Person other than the parties hereto) prior to the date of this
Agreement by it, its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives with
respect to the consideration or making of any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent Mondavi or the Mondavi Board prior to the Mondavi
Shareholders' Meeting from continuing any of its existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with the parties listed on Section 5.3(b)(iv) of the
Mondavi Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

              (v) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Mondavi shall
promptly, orally notify Constellation of any request for information or any
inquiries, proposals or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal (including
any Acquisition Proposal from a party listed on Section 5.3(b)(iv) of the
Mondavi Disclosure Schedule), indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and Mondavi shall
provide to Constellation written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer
within 24 hours of such event. Mondavi


                                      -29-
<PAGE>


shall keep Constellation informed orally on a current basis of the status of any
Acquisition Proposal (including any Acquisition Proposal from a party listed on
Section 5.3(b)(iv) of the Mondavi Disclosure Schedule), including with respect
to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer and whether any such
proposal or offer has been withdrawn or rejected and Mondavi shall provide to
Constellation written notice of any such developments within 24 hours. Mondavi
also agrees to provide any information to Constellation (not theretofore
provided to Constellation) that it is providing to another Person pursuant to
this Section 5.3(b) at substantially the same time it provides such information
to such other Person.

              (vi) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(b) by any officer,
director or employee of Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries or any Representative
of Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting
to act on behalf of Mondavi or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3(b) by Mondavi.

              (vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the Mondavi Shareholders for the purpose of
approving this Agreement and the Merger, regardless of the recommendation or any
change in the recommendation of the Mondavi Board with respect thereto.

              (viii) For purposes of this Agreement:

                    (A) "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means any proposal or offer with
respect to (1) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction
involving Mondavi, (2) any purchase of an equity interest (including by means of
a tender or exchange offer) representing an amount equal to or greater than a
15% voting or economic interest in Mondavi, or (3) any purchase of assets,
securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater
than 15% of the consolidated assets of Mondavi and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole (including stock of the subsidiaries of Mondavi).

                    (B) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that would result in a Person (other than a party hereto,
or a subsidiary of a party hereto) (an "ACQUIROR") having record or beneficial
ownership of 100% of the voting or economic interest in Mondavi or all or
substantially all of the assets of Mondavi and that is on terms that the Mondavi
Board (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside
counsel) in good faith concludes, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of obtaining
financing, and the Acquiror making the proposal, (1) would, if consummated,
result in a transaction more favorable to the Mondavi Shareholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into account any change in the transaction proposed by Constellation, and
(2) is reasonably likely to be consummated prior to the Termination Date (as
defined in Section 7.2 of the Agreement).

          (c) THIRD PARTY STANDSTILL AGREEMENTS. Subject to Section
5.3(b)(iii)(A), during the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement: (i) Mondavi
shall not (and shall not agree to, and shall not permit


                                      -30-

any of its subsidiaries to or to agree to) terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of
its subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving Constellation or its
subsidiaries); and (ii) Mondavi shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreements, including obtaining
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such confidentiality or standstill
agreements and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

          (d) ACCESS. From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject
to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 31,

Constellation, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such
Persons may reasonably request, (iii) instruct the employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Mondavi and its
subsidiaries to cooperate with Constellation in its investigation of Mondavi and
its subsidiaries and (iv) promptly advise Constellation orally and in writing of
any fact or circumstance reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Mondavi. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall be conducted in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
Mondavi and its subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained by
Constellation in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by Mondavi hereunder.

          (e) SUBSEQUENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Mondavi shall consult with
Constellation prior to making publicly available its financial results after the
date of this Agreement and a reasonable time prior to filing any Mondavi SEC
Documents after the date of this Agreement.

shall deliver certifications, reasonably acceptable to Constellation, satisfying
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)
and confirming that Mondavi is not and has not been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

warranty, covenant or agreement made by Mondavi in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect after the

on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other Representatives), other
than the provisions of this Section 7.5 and Section 7.6; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement.

          7.6. FEES AND EXPENSES.

          (a) In the event that:


                                      -34-
<PAGE>


              (i) (A)(1) Constellation shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.4(b) or (2) Constellation or Mondavi shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), (B) on or prior to
such time (or in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 7.2(b), on or
prior to the Mondavi Shareholders' Meeting) any Person (other than
Constellation) shall have made (or publicly disclosed its intention to make) and
not withdrawn an Acquisition Proposal (substituting 40% for the 15% threshold
set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, a "COVERED PROPOSAL"), and
(C) within twelve (12) months of termination of this Agreement, Mondavi enters
into an agreement with respect to a Covered Proposal;

              (ii) This Agreement shall be terminated after Constellation shall
have become entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a)
(whether or not Constellation immediately terminates the Agreement or the
Agreement is subsequently terminated pursuant to any other provision under this
Article VII); or

              (iii) Mondavi shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(b),

then, in any such event, Mondavi shall pay to Constellation a termination fee in
cash of $31 million (the "TERMINATION FEE"). Any Termination Fee that becomes
payable shall be paid (x) in the case of clause (i) above, not later than the
date on which Mondavi enters into an agreement with respect to a Covered
Proposal, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second business day after
the date that the Agreement is terminated, and (z) in the case of clause (iii)

payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

          (b) Mondavi acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Constellation would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Mondavi fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant
to this Section 7.6, and, in order to obtain such payment, Constellation
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Mondavi for the fees set
forth in this Section 7.6 or any portion of such fees, Mondavi shall pay to
Constellation its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fees at the prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

          (c) Except as specifically provided in this Section 7.6, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such
expenses, except filing fees incurred in connection with Commission filings
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
printing and mailing costs related thereto, all of which shall be shared equally
by Constellation and Mondavi.

          8.3. INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." For the purposes of this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT" with respect to any party hereto means any event, change, circumstance,
effect or state of facts (an "EFFECT") that is a material adverse effect (i) on
the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party hereto
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) on its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in no
event will any of the following, alone or in combination, constitute a Material
Adverse Effect: (a) any change in Mondavi's stock price or trading volume, in
and of itself; (b) any Effect affecting any of the industries in which Mondavi
operates generally or affecting the economy generally, to the extent not having
a materially disproportionate impact on Mondavi and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, than the effect on similarly situated companies; and (c) any Effects
resulting from the announcement or pendency of any of the transactions provided
for in this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUBSIDIARY," when used
with respect to any party hereto, means any entity of which such party (a) owns
50% or more of the outstanding securities or other ownership interests, or (b)
through contract or otherwise possesses power to appoint at least 50% of the
directors of such entity (or persons performing similar functions).

which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties hereto

an original.

          8.5. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the documents and the

shall be construed to create any third-party beneficiaries.

          8.7. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (other than with respect to
California state corporate law matters, with respect to which the laws of the
State of California shall apply) without regard to the conflicts of law rules of
such state. All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined in any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware.

          8.8. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

          (a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of the parties
hereto irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such Action may be heard
and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of
any summons and complaint and any other process in any other Action relating to
the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of
copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this Section 8.8 shall affect
the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

          8.9. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are unique. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, each
of the parties hereto is entitled to a decree of specific performance, PROVIDED
that such party hereto is not in material default hereunder. The parties hereto
agree that, if for any reason Constellation, Merger Sub or Mondavi shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then the party hereto
seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this
Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other
equitable relief, and the parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
such injunctive or other equitable relief. This provision is without prejudice
to any other rights that any party hereto may have against another party hereto
for any failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

          8.10. ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

          8.11. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the Mondavi Shareholders;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that
by law requires approval by the Mondavi Shareholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

          8.12. EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.11, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights and the single or partial
exercise of any rights hereof shall not preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

          8.13. SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

     (a)  Each share of common stock, without par value, of Merger Sub issued

          shares of Mondavi Class A Common Stock owned by shareholders properly
          exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 1300 of the CGCL
          ("SECTION 1300"), shall be converted into and represent the right to
          receive $56.50 in cash, without interest.


     (c)  Each share of Class B Common Stock of Mondavi, without par value
          ("MONDAVI CLASS B COMMON STOCK," and together with the Mondavi Class A

          Merger) and any shares of Mondavi Class B Common Stock owned by
          shareholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section
          1300, shall be converted into and represent the right to receive
          $65.82 in cash, without interest.


     (d)  Each share of Mondavi capital stock held in the treasury of Mondavi,
          or held by Constellation or any wholly-owned subsidiary of
          Constellation, automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no
          payment shall be made in respect thereof. [Each share of Mondavi Class
          B Common Stock held by any wholly-owned subsidiary of Mondavi shall be
          converted into such number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
          Stock such that each such wholly-owned subsidiary owns the same
          percentage (in terms of economic value) of Surviving Corporation
          Common Stock immediately following the Effective Time as the
          percentage (in terms of economic value) of Mondavi Common Stock that
          such wholly-owned subsidiary owned immediately prior to the Effective
          Time.] [Each share of Mondavi
