the Accounting Referee that, within 15 Business Days after receiving the
Parties respective submissions, the Accounting Referee shall render a
decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to
each disputed adjustment addressed in any Dispute Notice, whichever is most
accurate based on the terms of the Agreement and the materials described
above. The Accounting Referee shall calculate only the disputed adjustments
addressed in the Dispute Notice that are not otherwise resolved and agreed
upon in writing by Seller and Buyer after delivery of the Dispute Notice. Each
choice between Sellers position and Buyers position with respect to any
disputed adjustment that is rendered by the Accounting Referee in accordance
with this _Section 2.6_ shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and
Buyer and shall be enforceable against each of the Parties in any court

set forth in the Final Settlement Statement incorporating the adjustment
amounts determined by the Accounting Referee in accordance with this _Section
2.6_, in addition to the adjustment amounts agreed to in writing by the
Parties, shall be final and binding on the Parties (other than with respect to
amounts not accounted for therein or settled thereby, which amounts shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 2.7_). The Accounting Referee shall be
authorized to resolve only the specific disputed aspects of the Final
Settlement Statement submitted by the Parties as provided above and may not

Referees decision with respect to any disputed adjustments in accordance with

production, then such amount shall, within five Business Days after the end of
the month in which such amounts were received, be paid over to the proper
Party, (b) any Party or its Affiliates pays monies for expenses or obligations
that are the obligation of the other Party or its Affiliates under _Section

obligation is received by a Party or its Affiliates that is partially an

the foregoing, from and after the date that is the later of (i) 150 days after

other Party prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before
any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging such Allocation.

 



 

2.9 _Indemnity Holdback_. At Closing, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, in partial satisfaction of Buyers obligation
to pay to Seller the Closing Amount at Closing, the Deposit shall be
reclassified at Closing to become the " ** _Holdback Amount_** " for the
purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Holdback Amount,
together with the interest earned thereon from and after the Closing (such
interest, together with the Holdback Amount, " ** _Escrow Fund_** "), shall be
held in the Escrow Account and paid out in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 2.9_ and the Escrow Agreement by way of security in support of
the indemnification obligations of Seller under _Section 4.2_. From time to
time after Closing, the Escrow Agent shall be irrevocably instructed in
writing by Seller and Buyer to release all or portions of then-remaining
Escrow Fund to Buyer or to Seller, in each case, as provided below in this
_Section 2.9_.

 



 

(a) If at any time prior to the nine month anniversary of the Closing Date
(such time period, the " ** _Holdback Period_** ") there are amounts remaining
in the Escrow Fund, to the extent that Seller does not promptly (and in any
event within 30 days after receipt of a Claim Notice from Buyer) reimburse or
pay Buyer for any amounts to which Buyer is entitled with respect to such
Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 4.2_, then Buyer shall be entitled, at any
time and from time to time, to deliver to Seller written notice (an " **
_Escrow Claim Notice_** ") which notice shall specify with particularity the
nature and amount of Buyers claim pursuant to _Section 4.2 _set forth in the
Claim Notice (the " ** _Escrow Claim_** "), including details of and a basis
under this Agreement entitling Buyer to such Escrow Claim and, if such Escrow
Claim is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, the Escrow Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached. Upon final resolution of any such Escrow Claim pursuant to the
mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller or as determined by a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
_Section 12.7_, if Buyer is entitled to all or any portion of the Escrow Fund
then-remaining, then Seller and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount set forth in such joint
written instruction, which amount shall be that portion of the Escrow Fund
remaining at such time in the Escrow Account as would satisfy such Escrow
Claim.

 



 

(b) On the first Business Day following the expiration of the Holdback Period,
Seller and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to release to Seller any amounts then-remaining in the Escrow Fund, excluding
those amounts attributable to any then-outstanding Escrow Claim for which
Buyer has provided an Escrow Claim Notice to Seller and Escrow Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_ that have not been previously satisfied and,
with respect to each such outstanding Escrow Claim, the amount attributable
thereto (to the extent sufficient funds remain in the Escrow Fund as of such
date and if there are insufficient funds remaining in the Escrow Fund as of
such date, the entirety of the funds remaining in the Escrow Fund as of such
date) shall remain part of the Escrow Fund in the Escrow Account until

 



      
 

 



 

final resolution of such Escrow Claim pursuant to the mutual written agreement
of Buyer and Seller or as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 12.7_. Upon such
final resolution, Seller and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to distribute the applicable funds in accordance with the
resolution.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3** ** 
LOSS AND CASUALTY / INSPECTION OF ASSETS**

 



 

3.1 _Casualty Loss_. If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing
Date, any portion of the Assets suffers a Casualty Loss, then Buyer shall
nevertheless be required to Close, and (a) in the event of a taking, the
Assets affected thereby shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated
Value of all Assets affected by such taking, or (b) except as provided in (a),
Seller shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing either (i) to
cause, at Sellers sole cost and expense, any Asset affected by a Casualty
Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its quality and condition as
before the Casualty Loss as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may
extend after the Closing Date), or (ii) reduce the Purchase Price by the cost
to repair or restore each Asset affected by such Casualty Loss to at least its
quality and condition as before the Casualty Loss. In each case, Seller shall
be entitled to receive all of its and the Companys rights to insurance and
other Claims (including any condemnation proceeds) with respect to the
Casualty Loss, except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

3.2 _Post-Closing Insurance_. Buyer understands and agrees that from and after
the Closing, (a) no insurance coverage shall be provided to the Company or
Buyer under any insurance policy issued to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
(other than the Company), and (b) no Claims regarding any matter whatsoever,
whether or not arising from events occurring prior to the Effective Time,
shall be made by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) directly
against or under any of the afore-described insurance policies, regardless of
their date of issuance.

 



 

3.3 _Access_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 3.3_ and obtaining any required consents of Non-
Parties, including Non-Party operators of the Assets (which consents Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Company to obtain but
Seller shall not be required to pay any consideration therefor), Seller shall
afford to members of the Buyer Group, upon reasonable prior notice, access,
during normal business hours or such other times as may be reasonably
accommodated by Seller, to the Assets and all Records in Sellers or its
Affiliates possession or control. All investigations and due diligence
conducted by the Buyer Group shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and
expense, and any conclusions made from any examination done by the Buyer Group
shall result from Buyers own independent review and judgment. Buyer shall
coordinate its access rights and physical inspections of the Assets with
Seller so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business by
Seller, the Company or the operator of the Assets and Seller shall have the
right to accompany the Buyer Group in connection with any physical inspection
of the Assets

 



      
 

 



 

at Sellers sole risk and expense (without limiting, however, Buyers
indemnity obligations under _Section 3.3(c)_). Buyer shall, and shall cause
all other members of the Buyer Group to, abide by Sellers and any Non-Party
operators applicable safety rules, regulations and operating policies that
are communicated in writing in advance to Buyer Group while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or other
inspection or assessment of the Assets.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.3(a)_ to the contrary, (i) no
Invasive Activity shall be conducted by any member of the Buyer Group upon the
Assets and (ii) no member of the Buyer Group shall have access to, have the
right to review or otherwise be permitted to conduct any due diligence
(including any Phase I environmental property assessments) with respect to any
Assets where Seller or the Company do not have the authority to grant access
to or the right to review or otherwise grant permission to conduct due
diligence with respect to such Assets (unless Buyer independently obtains
authorization from the applicable Third Party to conduct such due diligence),
provided that if Buyer is not allowed access to conduct any due diligence
(including a Phase I environmental property assessment) with respect to any
Well or other Assets where Seller or the Company have conducted or are
conducting any operations, then Buyer may elect, in its sole discretion, to
exclude the affected Assets from the transaction contemplated hereby, in which
event the affected Assets will be deemed Excluded Assets and included in the
Excluded Assets Assignment to be delivered at Closing, and the Purchase Price
will be reduced by the Allocated Value of all such affected Assets.

 



 

(c) Buyer hereby releases, indemnifies, defends and holds harmless each of the
operators of the Assets and the members of the Seller Group (including the
Company) from and against any and all Claims (including any injury, loss or
damage arising out of such entry that may occur) of any member of the Buyer
Group, arising out of, resulting from or relating to any office visit, field
visit, environmental property assessment or other due diligence activity
conducted by any member of the Buyer Group with respect to the Assets, EVEN IF
SUCH CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP, EXCEPTING ONLY CLAIMS ACTUALLY
RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A
MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP. In addition, Buyer hereby releases, indemnifies,
defends and holds harmless each of the operators of the Assets and the members
of the Seller Group (including the Company) from and against any and all
Claims (including any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry that
may occur) arising out of, resulting from or relating to any office visit,
field visit, environmental property assessment or other due diligence activity
conducted by any member of the Buyer Group with respect to the Assets to the
extent (and then only to the extent) such Claims are caused by or attributable
to actions or inactions of any member of the Buyer Group.

 



 

(d) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller copies of those environmental
reports and environmental test results prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyers
Representatives which relate to any (i) Environmental Defect Buyer intends to
assert or (ii) matter for which Buyer intends to assert a breach of _Section
6.12_. None of Buyer, any of Buyers Representatives or Seller shall be deemed
by Sellers receipt of said documents, or otherwise, to have made any

 



      
 

 



 

representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the
condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the
information contained therein. Buyer Group (in the event Closing does not
occur) and Seller Group (in the event Closing occurs) shall keep and maintain
confidential (and not disclose to any other Person, except as required by any
Governmental Authority, in whole or in part) any results of (or reports or
other documents arising from) an environmental assessment of the Assets.

 



 

(e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall, at its sole cost
and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Company), (i) repair all damage done to the Assets (including
the real property and other assets associated therewith) caused by any member
of the Buyer Groups due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets (including the
real property and other assets associated therewith) to at least the same
condition than prior to commencement of any member of the Buyer Groups due
diligence and (iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto
the Assets in connection with any member of the Buyer Groups due diligence,
provided that in no event will the foregoing be interpreted to require Buyer
to remediate any Environmental Defect to the extent not caused by any member
of Buyer Group.

 



 

(f) During all periods that any member of the Buyer Group is on the Assets,
Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers reasonably
satisfactory to Seller (or the applicable Non-Party operator, as applicable),
policies of insurance of types and in amounts sufficient to cover the
obligations and liabilities of Buyer under this _Section 3.3_. Coverage under
all insurance required to be carried by Buyer under this _Section 3.3(f)
_shall (i) be primary insurance, (ii) list the Seller Group as additional
insureds, and (iii) waive subrogation against the Seller Group. Upon request
by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to Seller prior to
entering the lands underlying the Assets.

 



 

3.4 _Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of
access to the Records and/or the Assets, Buyer shall become privy to
confidential and other information of Seller and the Company and that such
information shall be held confidential by Buyer and the other members of the
Buyer Group in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as
if each had been a party to the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing
should occur, the immediately foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to the
Excluded Assets).

 



 

3.5 _Disclaimers_.

SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE 6_ AND IN THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SELLER PURSUANT

 **ARTICLE 4** ** 
ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNITIES**

 



 

4.1 _Buyer Acknowledgement of Obligations_. Except to the extent (and only to
the extent) that Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer Group pursuant to
_Section 4.2_, Buyer expressly acknowledges that the Company is responsible
for, and neither the Company nor Buyer shall have any recourse against Seller
or the Seller Group for, the debts, liabilities, commitments, duties and
obligations of the Company, including those arising under, related to or in
connection with the ownership, operation, use or condition of the Assets
and/or the business of the Company, whether or not such debts, liabilities,

on or after the Effective Time.

 



 

4.2 _Seller s Indemnity Obligation_. If Closing shall occur, then effective
from and after the Closing Date, and subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 4.4_, Seller hereby defends, indemnifies and holds Buyer Group
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company) harmless from and against
any and all Claims arising out of, resulting from or relating to:

 



 

(a) any breach by Seller of Sellers representations or warranties set forth

(f) the Sellers, Companys or any of their Affiliates failure to properly
pay, in accordance with the terms of any Lease, all Burdens with respect to
such Lease prior to the Effective Time (other than for amounts held in
suspense); and

 



 

(g) the Excluded Assets;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall Seller have any obligation to
provide indemnification for any matters to the extent adjustments therefor are
taken into account in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or the Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

4.3 _Buyer s Indemnity Obligation_. If Closing shall occur, from and after
the Closing Date, Buyer hereby releases, defends, indemnifies and holds Seller
Group harmless from and against any and all Claims arising out of, resulting
from or relating to:

(b) (i) the ownership of the Interests and the Company, (ii) the ownership,
use operation, or condition of the Assets (directly or indirectly), and/or

but excepting, in each case, Claims with respect to which Seller is required
to indemnify Buyer and the other members of the Buyer Group pursuant to S
_ection 4.2 _or _Section 8.15_.

 



 

4.4 _Claim Periods, Deductible, Threshold and Cap_. Seller shall have no
obligation or liability under _Section 4.2_, for:

 



 

(a) any Claim asserted by Buyer hereunder, if Buyer has not provided Seller
with a Claim Notice on or before the nine month anniversary of the Closing
Date with respect to such Claim (other than any Claim for a breach by Seller
of its representation and warranty in _Section 6.31_ or a Claim related to
Taxes);

 



 

(b) any Claim asserted by Buyer hereunder (other than any Claim (i) for a
breach by Seller of its representation and warranty in _Section 6.9_ or
_Section 6.31_, (ii) for a breach of Sellers covenants in _Article 2_,
_Section 8.3_ or _Section 8.13_ or (iii) under _Section 4.2(g)_), if such
Claim has a value of $100,000 or less (the " ** _Threshold Amount_** ") (and
these types of

 



       
 

 



 

Claims shall not be counted in determining whether the Indemnity Deductible
has been reached);

 



 

(c) any Claim asserted by Buyer hereunder (other than any Claim (i) for a
breach by Seller of its representation and warranty in _Section 6.9_ or
_Section 6.31_, (ii) for a breach of Sellers covenants in _Article 2_,
_Section 8.3_ or _Section 8.13_ or (iii) under _Section 4.2(g)_) if the
aggregate amount of all Claims asserted by Buyer hereunder that are in excess
of the Threshold Amount does not exceed the Indemnity Deductible, and then
only to the extent such Claims exceed the Indemnity Deductible; and

 



 

(d) any Claims asserted by Buyer hereunder to the extent exceeding, in the
aggregate, the Holdback Amount.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations described above shall not apply
to any Claim under _Section 4.2 _for breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations.

 



 

4.5 _Notice of Claims_. All claims for indemnification under _Section
3.3(c)_, _Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.3_ shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of _Section 3.3(c)_ and this _Article 4_, the term " **
_Indemnifying Party_** " when used in connection with particular Claims shall
mean the Party having an obligation to indemnify another Party or Person(s)
with respect to such Claims pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ or this _Article
4_, as applicable, and the term " ** _Indemnified Party_** " when used in
connection with particular Claims shall mean the Party or Person(s) having the
right to be indemnified with respect to such Claims by another Party pursuant
to _Section 3.3(c)_ or this Article 4, as applicable.

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section
4.2_ or _Section 4.3_, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party of its claim under this _Section 4.5_, including the specific details
of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " ** _Claim
Notice_** "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a
claim by a Non-Party against the Indemnified Party (a " ** _Non-Party Claim_**
"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Non-Party Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Non-Party
Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a
Non-Party Claim as provided in this _Section 4.5_ shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section 4.2_
or _Section 4.3_, as applicable, except to the extent (and then only to such
extent) such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit
the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Non-Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the Non-Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Non-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice
to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to
indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party against such Non-Party Claim at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30 day

 



      
 

 



 

period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to
notify the Indemnified Party on whether it admits or denies its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have denied its liability.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Non-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, such
Non-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
contesting any Non-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest.
The Indemnified Party may participate in, at its own expense, but subject to
the Indemnifying Partys full control of, any defense or settlement of any
Non-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
4.5(d)_; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required
to bring any counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person. The foregoing
provisions of this _Section 4.5(d)_ shall not apply to any Non-Party Claim by
a Governmental Authority with respect to a Tax. An Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Non-
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that
does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party
from all Claims in respect of such Non-Party Claim or (ii) settle any Non-
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in
any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Non-Party Claim, but
fails to diligently prosecute or settle such Non-Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Non-Party Claim
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of its
choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its
liability and assume the defense of the Non-Party Claim at any time prior to
settlement or final determination thereof. Any settlement of the Non-Party
Claim by the Indemnified Party shall require the consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless the settlement is solely for money damages and results in a final
resolution.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Non-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Claims complained of, (ii) admit its liability for such
Claim or (iii) dispute the claim for such Claims. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it has
cured the Claims or that it disputes the claim for such Claims, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to dispute its liability for such Claims.

 



 

4.6 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. NO MEMBER OF THE BUYER GROUP OR SELLER GROUP
SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM SELLER OR BUYER, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES, ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY,
REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OF ANY KIND ARISING
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

 



      
 

 



 

AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY
SUCH PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO A NON-PARTY, WHICH DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS
OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING
AGAINST SUCH DAMAGES) SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED BY THIS PROVISION AS TO RECOVERY
HEREUNDER. SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, BUYER, ON BEHALF OF EACH MEMBER
OF THE BUYER GROUP, AND SELLER, ON BEHALF OF EACH MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP,
WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OF ANY
KIND, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

4.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement but except as set forth in _Section 8.3 _or _Section 8.13_,
for the Special Warranty and except for damages in the case of common law
actual fraud or any breach of the provisions of _Article 2_ regarding the
Final Settlement Statement and the final Adjusted Purchase Price, from and
after Closing, _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.3_ contain
the Parties exclusive remedies against each other or each Partys Affiliates
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breaches
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement and the affirmations of such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the certificate(s) delivered
by each Party at Closing pursuant to _Section 10.2(c)_ or _Section 10.3(c)_,

 **ARTICLE 5** ** 
TITLE MATTERS; ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

5.1 _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations; Exclusive
Remedy_. Without limiting Buyers remedies for Title Defects as expressly set
forth in this _Article 5_ or under the Special Warranty, Seller makes no
warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
respect to the Companys title to any of the Assets. Except for the Special
Warranty, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole and exclusive
remedy for any defect in title or any other title matter (including any Title
Defect with respect to any of the Assets or otherwise) shall be as set forth
in _Section 5.2_, and Buyer hereby expressly waives any and all other rights
or remedies with respect thereto.

 



 

5.2 _Title Defects_.

 



 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. On or before the Defect Claim Date, Buyer has the
right but not the obligation to deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the
requirements of this _Section 5.2(a)_ (collectively, the " ** _Title Defect
Notices_** ," and each individually, a " ** _Title Defect Notice_** ") setting
forth any matters that, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Title
Defects and that Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this
_Article 5_. For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and none of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any other member of the Seller Group shall
have any liability for, any Title Defect that Buyer fails to assert as a Title
Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Defect
Claim Date or any other title matter. To be effective, each Title Defect
Notice shall be in writing, and shall include: (i) a description of the
alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Assets affected by the alleged Title
Defect(s) (each a " ** _Title Defect Property_** "), (iii) the Allocated Value
of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary
for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the
amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations
(in reasonable detail) upon which Buyers belief is based. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing any Title Defects, Buyer agrees
to use its reasonable efforts to give Seller weekly written notices of all
alleged Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding period after
the Execution Date and prior to delivery of such notice, which notice may be
supplemented on or prior to the Defect Claim Date, provided that any failure
of Buyer to deliver such notice shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish Seller
with written notice of any Title Benefit that is discovered by any member of
the Buyer Group prior to the Defect Claim Date.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. In addition to any Title Benefits reported by
Buyer pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_, Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date a notice
meeting the requirements of this _Section 5.2(b)_ (collectively, the " **
_Title Benefit Notices_** ," and each individually, a " ** _Title Benefit
Notice_** ") setting forth any additional matters which, in Sellers
reasonable opinion, constitute Title Benefits and that Seller intends to
assert as a Title Benefit pursuant to this _Article 5_. To be effective, each
Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing, and shall include: (i) a description
of the alleged Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Assets affected by the Title
Benefit(s) (each a " ** _Title Benefit Property_** "), (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents available to
Seller reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Benefit(s), and (v) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Properties is increased by the alleged
Title Benefit(s) and the computations (in reasonable detail)

 



      
 

 



 

upon which Sellers belief is based. Except for Title Benefits that Buyer is
required to report to Seller pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_, Seller shall be
deemed to have waived, and Buyer shall not have any liability for, any Title
Benefit that Seller fails to assert as a Title Benefit by a Title Benefit
Notice received by Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date.

 



 

(c) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to the
Closing (the " ** _Cure Period_** "), any Title Defects of which it has timely
received a Title Defect Notice from Buyer.

 



 

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to (u) the Special Warranty, (w)
Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or
the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, (x) the rights of
Seller pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_, (y) the Individual Title Threshold and
(z) the Defect Deductible, if any Title Defect asserted by Buyer in accordance
with _Section 5.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured during the
Cure Period, then Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by an amount determined pursuant to _Section
5.2(f)_ or _Section 5.2(i)_ as being the value of such Title Defect to the
extent affecting the applicable Title Defect Property (the " ** _Title Defect
Amount_** ");

 



 

(ii) exclude the applicable Title Defect Property and any related Assets from
the transactions contemplated hereby and reduce the Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value of such excluded Title Defect Property and any related Assets
(and Seller shall cause the Company to convey such Title Defect Property and
related Assets, if any, to Seller or Sellers designee prior to Closing); or

 



 

(iii) with Buyers written consent (which consent may be withheld in Buyers
sole discretion), indemnify Buyer and the Company against all Claims, up to
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, resulting from such Title
Defect, pursuant to an indemnity agreement prepared by Seller in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. The aggregate Title Defect Amounts
attributable to all properly raised and uncured Title Defects shall be
decreased by the aggregate Title Benefit Amounts attributable to all properly
raised Title Benefits.

 



 

(f) _Title Defect Amount_. The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title
Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the affected Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect
and shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Seller and Buyer agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in the Net Revenue Interest
for any Title Defect Property from the Net Revenue Interest set forth in
_Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit C_, as applicable, for such Title Defect Property,
and the Working Interest is reduced proportionately, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property, multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the amount
of such Net Revenue Interest decrease and (B) the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in _Exhibit B_
or _Exhibit C_, as applicable; provided that if the Title Defect does not
affect the Title Defect Property throughout the entire life of such Title
Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount determined under this _Section
5.2(f)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

 



 

(iv) If the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Acres
for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Acres for such Title Defect
Property stated in _Exhibit C_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product obtained by multiplying the positive difference between such Net Acres
amounts by the Net Acre Allocation applicable to such Title Defect Property;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title affecting the Title Defect Property of a type not described
above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

 



 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 5_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

 



 

(g) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in the Net Revenue Interest
for any Title Benefit Property such that the actual Net Revenue Interest for
any Title Benefit Property is greater than the Net Revenue Interest stated in
_Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit C_, as applicable, for such Title Benefit Property,
and the Working Interest is increased proportionately, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of the

 



      
 

 



 

Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property, multiplied by a fraction, (A)
the numerator of which is the amount of such Net Revenue Interest increase and
(B) the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such
Title Benefit Property in _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit C_, as applicable;
provided that if the Title Benefit does not affect the Title Benefit Property
throughout the entire life of such Title Benefit Property, then the Title
Benefit Amount determined under this _Section 5.2(g)(ii)_ shall be reduced to
take into account the applicable time period only;

 



 

(iii) If the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Acres
for any Acreage Tract and (B) the Net Acres for such Acreage Tract stated in
_Exhibit C_, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product obtained by
multiplying the positive difference between such Net Acres amounts by the Net
Acre Allocation applicable to such Acreage Tract; and

 



 

(iv) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 



 

(h) _Individual Title Threshold and Defect Deductible_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price or any other remedy provided by Seller hereunder for any
individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount applicable thereto
does not exceed the lesser of (A) $100,000 and (B) 15% of the Allocated Value
of the applicable Title Defect Property (the " ** _Individual Title
Threshold_** "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or any other remedy provided by Seller hereunder for any Title
Defect for which the Title Defect Amount applicable thereto exceeds the
Individual Title Threshold until (A) the sum of (1) the Title Defect Amounts
of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Threshold, in the
aggregate (excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects
cured by Seller during the Cure Period), _plus_ (2) the Remediation Amounts of
all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold,
in the aggregate (excluding any Remediation Amounts attributable to
Environmental Defects Remediated by Seller during the Cure Period), _less_ (3)
the sum of all the Title Benefit Amounts determined under _Section 5.2(g)_,
_exceeds_ (B) the Defect Deductible, at which point Buyer shall only be
entitled to remedies hereunder with respect to such amounts in excess of the
Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller elects to exclude a
Title Defect Property affected by a Title Defect and any related Assets from
the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the remedy set forth in
_Section 5.2(d)(ii)_, then, after such election, the Title Defect Amount and
related Purchase Price adjustment relating to such excluded Assets (x) will
not be counted towards the Defect Deductible and (y) will be counted for
purposes of _Section 9.1(d) _and _Section 9.2(d)_.

 



 

(i) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
each disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount and Title
Benefit Amount (collectively " ** _Title Disputes_** ") prior to the Closing.
If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on any Title

 



      
 

 



 

Dispute by Closing, then either Party shall have the right to elect, upon
written notice to the other Party on or before 15 Business Days after the
Defect Claim Date, to initiate arbitration to resolve such Title Dispute. All
Title Disputes shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this
_Section 5.2(i)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title
attorney with at least ten years experience in oil and gas titles involving
properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties are
located (the " ** _Title Arbitrator_** "). The Title Arbitrator shall be
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the
election by a Party to utilize the provisions of this _Section 5.2(i)_ with
respect to a Title Dispute. If the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon
the Title Arbitrator by such date, the Houston, Texas office of the AAA shall
appoint the Title Arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Houston,
Texas, and the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA
Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
_Section 5.2(i)_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall, within five days of the
appointment of the Title Arbitrator, summarize its position with regard to the
applicable Title Dispute in a written document of ten pages or less and submit
such summaries to the Title Arbitrator, together with the applicable Title
Defect Notice or Title Benefit Notice and any other documentation such Party
may desire to submit. Seller shall also furnish the Title Arbitrator with a
copy of this Agreement. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be made
within 30 days after submission of the Title Dispute to the Title Arbitrator
and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in _Section 5.2(f)_ and _Section 5.2(g)_ and, subject to the
foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title
Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator,
however, may not award (i) Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title
Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice or (ii)
Seller a greater Title Benefit Amount than the Title Benefit Amount claimed by
Seller in the applicable Title Benefit Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act
for the limited purpose of determining the specific Title Disputes submitted
by either Party and the Title Arbitrator may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either Party with respect to any Title Dispute. Seller and Buyer
shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to
the Title Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of
the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title Dispute is not taken into
account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and
the applicable Party would otherwise be entitled to an adjustment under the
provisions of _Section 5.2(d)_, _Section 5.2(e)_ and/or _Section 5.2(h)_,
as applicable, then within ten Business Days after the Title Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a
Title Dispute, subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, _Section 5.2(e)_ and/or _Section
5.2(h)_, as applicable, (A) if the Title Arbitrator awards any amount to
Seller, Buyer shall pay such amount to an account designated in writing by
Seller, and (B) if the Title Arbitrator awards any amount to Buyer, Seller
shall pay such amount to an account designated in writing by Buyer, in each
case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Nothing herein shall
operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted
pursuant to this _Section 5.2(i)_ with respect to any Title Defect properly
asserted by Buyer hereunder and, to the extent any adjustments therefor are
not agreed upon by the Parties as of the Closing, if Seller has selected the
remedy set forth in _Section 5.2(d)(i)_ with respect to such Title Defect,
the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price or payments, if any, shall be made pursuant
to this _Section 5.2(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

5.3 _Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(a) _Environmental Defect Notices_. On or before the Defect Claim Date, Buyer
has the right but not the obligation to deliver claim notices to Seller
meeting the requirements of this _Section 5.3(a)_ (collectively, the " **
_Environmental Defect Notices_** ", and each individually, an " **
_Environmental Defect Notice_** ") setting forth any matters that, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and that Buyer intends to
assert as an Environmental Defect pursuant to this _Article 5_. For all
purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and none of Seller or any of
its Affiliates or any other member of the Seller Group shall have any
liability for, any Environmental Defect that Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller on
or before the Defect Claim Date or any other environmental matter. To be
effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall
include: (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged
Environmental Defect (including the applicable Environmental Law violated or
implicated thereby), (ii) the Assets affected by the alleged Environmental
Defect(s) (each an " ** _Environmental Defect Property_** "), (iii) supporting
documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the
alleged Environmental Defect(s), and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation
Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is attributable to
such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyers calculation of the Remediation
Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable
detail the Remediation proposed for the asserted Environmental Defect and
identify all assumptions used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount,
including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing any Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable efforts
to give Seller weekly written notices of all alleged Environmental Defects
discovered by Buyer during the preceding weekly period after the Execution
Date and prior to delivery of such notice, which notice may be supplemented on
or prior to the Defect Claim Date, provided that any failure of Buyer to
deliver such notice shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Seller
shall at its sole discretion have the right, but not the obligation, to
Remediate at Sellers sole cost any claimed Environmental Defect during the
Cure Period.

 



 

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to (w) Sellers continuing
right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the
Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, (x) the rights of Seller
pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_, (y) the Individual Environmental Threshold and
(z) the Defect Deductible, if any Environmental Defect properly asserted by
Buyer in accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer
or Remediated during the Cure Period, then Seller shall, at its sole option,
elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount attributable to such
Environmental Defect;

 



 

(ii) exclude the applicable Environmental Defect Property and any related
Assets from the transactions contemplated hereby and reduce the Purchase Price
by the Allocated Value of such excluded Environmental Defect Property and
related Assets (and Seller shall cause the Company to convey such
Environmental Defect Property and related Assets, if any, to Seller or
Sellers designee prior to Closing); or

 



 

(iii) with Buyers written consent (which consent may be withheld in

 



       
 

 



 

Buyers sole discretion), indemnify Buyer and the Company against all Claims
resulting from such Environmental Defect, up to the Allocated Value of the
Environmental Defect Property, and associated Remediation pursuant to an
indemnity agreement mutually agreed by Buyer.

 



 

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer and the
Company shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and
expenses attributable to the Remediation of the applicable Environmental
Defect and all Claims with respect thereto, and shall have no further
liability or responsibility for any such Environmental Defect or Claim. If
Seller elects the option set forth in clause (iii) above and Buyer provides
its written consent to such option (which consent may be withheld in Buyers
sole discretion), Seller shall have the additional right to elect to assume
responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect and, if Seller
so elects, (A) Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to implement such
Remediation in a manner which is the lowest-cost response required by
Environmental Laws, in a timely fashion, for the type of Remediation that
Seller elects to undertake and (B) Buyer and the Company, effective as of the
Closing, hereby grant to Seller and its representatives access to the Assets
to conduct such Remediation at their sole risk and expense.

 



 

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers remedies under _Section 4.2(a)_
(with respect to a breach of _Section 6.12_) and _Section 4.2(c)_, _Section
5.3(b)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defect or other environmental matter, and Buyer (on its own
behalf and on behalf of the other members of the Buyer Group) hereby waives,
releases and agrees to defend and indemnify Seller from and against any future
Claims that may arise out of such Environmental Defect, other environmental
matter, or related claims, including (i) any Claims asserted by any
Governmental Authority, (ii) any Claims by any other Person and arising under
applicable common law or under Environmental Laws, or (iii) any claims for
contribution or cost-recovery (or similar claims) arising under Environmental
Laws (in each case, including without limitation, CERCLA).

 



 

(d) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount relating thereto does
not exceed $150,000 (the " ** _Individual Environmental Threshold_** "); and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount(s) relating thereto
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the sum of (1) the
Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Threshold, in the aggregate (excluding any Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller during the Cure Period), _plus_
(2) the Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the
Individual Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate (excluding any
Remediation Amounts attributable to Environmental Defects Remediated by Seller
during the Cure Period) _less_ (3) the sum of all the Title Benefit Amounts
determined under _Section 5.2(g)_, _exceeds_ (B) the Defect Deductible, at
which point Buyer shall only be entitled to remedies hereunder with respect to
such amounts in excess of the Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt,
if Seller elects to exclude an Environmental Defect Property affected by an
Environmental Defect and any related Assets from the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to the remedy set forth in _Section 5.3(b)(ii)_, then, after
such election, the Remediation Amount and related Purchase Price adjustment
relating to such excluded Assets (x) will not be counted towards the Defect

 



      
 

 



 

Deductible and (y) will be counted for purposes of _Section 9.1(d) _and
_Section 9.2(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on all disputed Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts
(collectively, the " ** _Environmental Disputes_** ") prior to Closing. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon any Environmental Dispute by
Closing, then either Party shall have the right to elect, upon written notice
to the other Party on or before 15 Business Days after the Defect Claim Date,
to initiate arbitration to resolve such Environmental Dispute. All
Environmental Disputes shall be exclusively and finally resolved through
arbitration pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten years
experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties
in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located (the " **
_Environmental Arbitrator_** "). The Environmental Arbitrator shall be
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the
election by a Party to utilize the provisions of this _Section 5.3(e)_ with
respect to an Environmental Dispute. If the Parties are unable to mutually
agree upon the Environmental Arbitrator by such date, the Houston, Texas
office of the AAA shall appoint such Environmental Arbitrator. The place of
arbitration shall be Houston, Texas, and the arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the AAA Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with
the terms of this _Section 5.3(e)_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall, within
five days of the appointment of the Environmental Arbitrator, summarize its
position with regard to the applicable Environmental Dispute in a written
document of ten pages or less and submit such summaries to the Environmental
Arbitrator, together with the applicable Environmental Defect Notice and any
other documentation such Party may desire to submit. Seller shall also furnish
the Environmental Arbitrator with a copy of this Agreement. The Environmental
Arbitrators determination shall be made within 30 days after submission of
the Environmental Dispute to the Environmental Arbitrator and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this _Section 5.3_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such
other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary
to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not
award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed
by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act for the limited purpose of determining the specific

of presenting its case to the Environmental Arbitrator. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental

respect to any Environmental Dispute is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and the applicable
Party would otherwise be entitled to an adjustment under the provisions of
_Section 5.3(d)_, then within ten Business Days after the Environmental
Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with
respect to an Environmental Dispute, subject to _Section 5.3(d)_, (A) if the
Environmental Arbitrator awards any amount to Seller, Buyer shall pay such
amount to an account designated in writing by Seller, and (B) if the
Environmental Arbitrator awards any amount to Buyer, Seller shall pay such
amount to an account designated in writing by Buyer, in each case, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Nothing herein shall operate to cause
Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(e)_ with respect to any Environmental Defect properly asserted
by Buyer hereunder and, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent any adjustments therefor are not agreed upon by the Parties as of the
Closing, if Seller has selected the remedy set forth in _Section 5.3(b)(i)_
with respect to such Environmental Defect, the Purchase Price shall not be
adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price
or payments, if any, shall be made pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)._

(B) the acts or omissions of the other Working Interest owners shall not
constitute a breach of the provisions of this _Section 8.1_, (C) no action
required by a vote of Working Interest owners shall constitute such a breach
so long as the Company has voted its interest in a manner that complies with
the provisions of this _Section 8.1_, and (D) the obligations of Seller and
the Company in this _Section 8.1_ shall be construed to require that Seller
cause the Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts (without being
obligated to incur any expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the
operator of such Assets to take such actions or render such performance within
the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable
agreements and, so long as the Company uses such commercially reasonable
efforts, it shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of this _Section
8.1_ by Seller.

 



 

8.2 _Names_. As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing, but in no event
later than (a) ten Business Days after Closing, Buyer shall change the name of

Governmental Authorities to accomplish the forgoing and to place the title or
other indicia of ownership of the Assets in a name other than any name of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any variations thereof.

 



 

8.3 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Up to the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for filing with the
applicable taxing authorities each Company Tax Return that is required to be
filed on or before the Closing Date and paying the Taxes due and owing with
respect thereto; provided that to the extent such Taxes relate to the periods
from and after the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to _Section
8.3(c)_, such payment shall be on behalf of Buyer, and promptly following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller any such Taxes; but only to the extent
that such amounts have not already been accounted for under _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for filing with the applicable taxing
authorities each Company Tax Return that is required to be filed after the
Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns as due and
owing; provided, however, that in the event that Seller is required by Law to
file a Tax Return with respect to such Taxes after the Closing Date that
includes all or a portion of a Tax period for which Buyer is liable for such
Taxes, following Sellers request, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller all such
Taxes allocable to the period or portion thereof beginning at or after the
Effective Time (but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been
accounted for under _Section 2.2_), whether such Taxes arise out of the
filing of an original Tax Return or a subsequent audit or assessment of Taxes.
Seller shall be entitled to all Tax credits and Tax refunds that relate to any
such Taxes allocable to any Tax period, or portion thereof, ending before the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Asset Taxes with respect to the Current Tax Period, but excluding Asset
Taxes that are based on quantity of or the value of production of
Hydrocarbons, shall be apportioned between the Parties as of the Effective
Time with (i) Seller being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the
actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by
_multiplying_ such actual Taxes by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Current Tax Period prior to the Effective Time and
(B) the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax
Period, and (ii) Buyer being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the
actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by
_multiplying_ such actual Taxes by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is
the number of days (including the Closing Date) in the Current Tax Period from
and after the Effective Time and (B) the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the Current Tax Period. Asset Taxes that are based on
quantity of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned
between the Parties based on the number of units or value of production
actually produced, as applicable, before, on or after the Effective Time. Any
Income Tax Liability of the Company or Franchise Tax Liability shall be
apportioned between the Parties as of the Effective Time with (i) Sellers
being obligated to pay the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of
the Company ended on (but did not include) the Effective Time, and (ii) Buyer
being obligated to

 



      
 

 



 

pay the remainder; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on (but not
including) the Effective Time and the period beginning from and after the
Effective Time in proportion to the number of days in each period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Texas franchise Tax shall
be allocated to the period during which the income, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the
right to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such
franchise Tax. To the extent the Company is included in a combined Texas
franchise tax report with Seller or an affiliate of Seller, the allocation
provided in this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall be calculated as if the Company left
the combined group immediately after the Effective Time. In the event that
Buyer or Seller makes any payment (directly or indirectly) for which it is
entitled to reimbursement under this _Section 8.3_, the applicable Party
shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten days
after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the presenting Party is entitled along with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of the
reimbursement.

 



 

(d) The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company for any
taxable period ending prior to the date of the Effective Time and for the
portion of any Current Tax Period through the Effective Time shall be for the
account of the Seller. The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Company for any taxable period or the portion of any Current Tax Period
beginning on or after the date of the Effective Time shall be for the account
of the Buyer. The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company for
any Current Tax Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Buyer and
the Sellers in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_.
Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the
Party entitled to receive a refund or credit of Tax pursuant to this _Section
8.3(d)_ the amount of such refund or credit within 30 days after such refund
is received, or such credit is recognized, in each case net of any costs or
expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund or
credit. Buyer shall take all necessary actions, or cause the Company to take
all necessary actions, as commercially reasonable (i) to obtain any refunds of
Taxes of the Company for the account of the Seller pursuant to this _Section
8.3(d)_, or (ii) to obtain credits or offsets to Taxes of the Company
attributable to taxable periods ending prior to the date of the Effective Time
or the portion of any Current Tax Period through (but not including) the
Effective Time.

 



 

(e) The Purchase Price shall be increased pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ by (or
Buyer shall otherwise reimburse Seller for) the amount of Asset Tax for all
Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date that
Seller or the Company has paid on behalf of other Working Interest owners,
royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other
interests owners in such Assets and that have not been recouped by Seller or
the Company before the Closing Date from such other Working Interest owners,
royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other interest
owners in such Assets and Buyer shall be subrogated to all rights with respect
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that Buyer
receives any Tax refund or credit to which Seller is entitled as described
above, or any recoupment of Taxes described in the preceding sentence, Buyer
shall cause the Company to immediately pay such amount to Seller to the extent
the Adjusted Purchase Price has not been increased pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_ on account thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.3_,
_Section 2.5_, _Section 2.7_, _Article 4_, _Section 5.2(d)_ or this
_Section 8.3_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

8.4 _No Talk/No Shop_. Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
the Company not to, directly or indirectly, and shall instruct all
representatives of Seller, its Affiliates and the Company not to, solicit
offers from, provide any information to, negotiate with or accept any proposal
from any Third Party relating to the acquisition of all, substantially all, or
any meaningful portion of the Assets or the Interests, whether directly or
indirectly, through purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise.

 



 

8.5 _Certain Notices_. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Seller
shall give prompt written notice to Buyer if, to the Knowledge of Seller,
there has been a breach of any of Buyers representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein and Buyer shall give prompt written notice to
Seller if, to the Knowledge of Buyer, there has been a breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller contained herein.

 



 

8.6 _Bonds_. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guaranties posted by any Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company)
with a Governmental Authority or co-owners that relate to the Assets,
including those set forth on _Schedule 8.6_ , will be transferred to Buyer or
the Company. At or prior to Closing, Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense,
shall deliver to Seller evidence of the posting of replacements for such
bonds, letters of credit and guaranties to the extent such replacements are
necessary to permit the cancellation of the bonds, letters of credit and
guaranties posted by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company).

 



 

8.7 _Records_. Within 10 Business Days after the Closing Date (except as
provided below), Seller shall furnish to Buyer original versions, to the
extent available, or where original versions are not available, full and
complete copies, of all Records that are maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates and that are not in the possession of the Company; provided,
however, Seller may retain (a) copies, at Sellers own expense, of any or all
Records and (b) all Records associated with any Excluded Assets. Buyer shall
maintain copies of the Records it acquires for a period of seven years after
the Closing, and shall afford Seller full access to the Records as reasonably
requested by Seller. If Buyer desires to destroy any physical Records and not
retain an electronic copy thereof within such seven year period, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing prior to such destruction and provide Seller the
opportunity to take possession of the same at Sellers sole cost.

 



 

8.8 _Excluded and Included Assets_. Immediately prior to Closing, Seller shall
(a) cause the Company to convey all of its right, title and interest in and to
the Excluded Assets held by the Company to Seller or Sellers designee

to erase any and all data, software and other information from any desktop,
laptop, smart phone, tablet or other mobile computing device, network gear,
data center gear and any other information

 



      
 

 



 

technology equipment held by the Company that (i) contains only proprietary
information of Seller (and not the Company) or (ii) relates to an Excluded
Asset.

 



 

8.10 _Additional Leases_.

 



 

(a) Between the Execution Date and Closing, Seller shall have the right (after
consultation with Buyer), but not the obligation, to cause the Company to
acquire Additional Leases where title has been approved by Buyer. With respect
to all Additional Leases acquired by the Company prior to Closing, the
Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer at Closing shall be adjusted upward
pursuant to _Section 2.2 _in an amount equal to the total Acquisition
Consideration for all such acquired Additional Leases. Sellers rights under
this _Section 8.10(a)_ are subject to the following provisions:

 



 

(i) From time to time, but no less frequently than weekly during the period
from the Execution Date up to the Closing, Seller will provide Buyer with a
written list of the Additional Leases that Company seeks to obtain (an " **
_Additional Lease Notice_** "). An Additional Lease Notice shall include
reasonable full particulars identifying such Additional Leases, the number of
Net Acres subject to each Additional Lease and a computation of the total
Acquisition Consideration to be paid therefor. Prior to the acquisition of any
Additional Lease, Seller shall provide documentation in Sellers or the
Companys possession regarding title to the Additional Leases.

 



 

(ii) Company may not acquire more than 500 Net Acres pursuant to this _Section
8.10_.

 



 

(iii) In no event will an overriding royalty interest be created in favor of
Seller or its Affiliates that will burden the Additional Leases.

 



 

(iv) The Additional Leases will not be burdened by Burdens in excess of 25%.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
does not acquire at least 140 Net Acres of Additional Leases in the northern
portion (as depicted on _Exhibit I_) of the Additional Lease Area that are
located within a unit operated by Affiliate Operator prior to the Closing
Date, then the Purchase Price will be reduced by an amount equal to (i) 140
Net Acres _less_ the applicable Net Acres of such Additional Leases that were
acquired prior to the Closing Date _multiplied by_ (ii) $41,868 per Net Acre,
without regard to any thresholds, deductibles or caps.

 



 

(c) To the extent Company acquires any Other Leases, Seller, in its sole
discretion, shall have the right to cause the Company, prior to Closing, to
assign such Other Leases to Seller or its designated Affiliate pursuant to the
Excluded Assets Assignment and such Other Leases shall be considered Excluded
Assets for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(d) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.10_ shall be of no force or
effect if the Closing does not occur.

 



 

8.11 _Operatorship_. The Parties acknowledge that an Affiliate of the Company,
Rock

 



      
 

 



 

Oil II, Inc. (d/b/a in Texas JPM EOC Operating, Inc.), is the operator of some
of the Assets (" ** _Affiliate Operator_** "). While Buyer acknowledges that
it desires to succeed Affiliate Operator as operator of those Assets or
portions thereof that Affiliate Operator may presently operate, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant
that Buyer shall become successor operator of same since the Assets or
portions thereof may be subject to operating or other agreements that control
the appointment of a successor operator. Within five Business Days after
Closing, Seller shall cause Affiliate Operator to send notices to co-owners of
the Oil and Gas Properties that Affiliate Operator currently operates
indicating that Affiliate Operator is resigning as operator, effective as of
the Closing Date, and recommending that Buyer be elected successor operator.
Seller shall cooperate (and cause Affiliate Operator to cooperate), without
having to pay or incur any cost or expense (unless paid by Buyer), with Buyer
in connection with Buyers efforts to have Buyer be elected successor
operator. If requested by Buyer, the Company will cast its vote, and will
execute mutually satisfactory letters prepared by Buyer requesting the votes
of the other owners of working interests in the relevant Oil and Gas
Properties, in each case in favor of the designation of Buyer as successor
operator of the Oil and Gas Properties, effective as of the Closing Date.

 



 

8.12 _Drilling Contract_. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in (a) obtaining a consent to
assign the Drilling Contract from Seller to Buyer or the Company and (b)
obtaining from the counterparty to the Drilling Contract, in favor of
Affiliate Operator, a full release of all liability with respect to the
Drilling Contract from and after the Effective Time. Upon request from Seller,
Buyer shall execute an assignment and assumption agreement (or other similar
agreement requested by the counterparty to the Drilling Contract) in which the
Drilling Contract is assigned from Affiliate Operator to the Company and
Company and/or Buyer assumes all liability under the Drilling Contract from
and after the Effective Time; provided that Buyer shall not be required to
execute any such agreement to the extent it materially amends the financial
terms of the Drilling Contract. With Buyers prior consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Seller, or its applicable
Affiliate, shall have the right to amend the Drilling Contract extending the
term of such Drilling Contract consistent with past practices in order to
conduct the drilling operations set forth on _Schedule 8.1_.

 



 

8.13 _Non-Compete_. Effective as of Closing, until the six-month anniversary
of the Closing Date, Seller covenants and agrees that it will, and will cause
its Affiliates (other than the Riverstone Companies) and the Persons set forth

account or for any Third Party (other than the Company or Buyer), any oil and
gas lease or mineral interest (including any mineral fee interest) within
Howard County, Texas, excluding, however, the Excluded Assets and excluding
any such leases or interests acquired by Seller or its Affiliates within the
same any units or pooling arrangements wherein any such leases or interests
are pooled or unitized with any Excluded Asset (subject to such exclusion,
collectively, the " ** _Non-Compete Assets_** "). To the extent Seller
breaches this S _ection 8.13_, in addition to any other remedies that may be
available in law and equity, Seller shall be obligated to immediately offer to
Buyer any acquired Non-Compete Assets, and Buyer shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to acquire (or cause the Company to acquire) such Non-Compete
Assets under the same terms and conditions as agreed to by Seller or such
Affiliate or any Person set forth on _Schedule 8.13_ , and for the same
consideration paid by Seller

 



      
 

 



 

or such Affiliate or such Person set forth on _Schedule 8.13_ , together with
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller or such Affiliate in acquiring
such Non-Compete Assets.

 



 

8.14 _JOA_. In the event Seller exercises its remedy in _Section 5.2(d)(ii)
_or _Section 5.3(b)(ii)_ or Buyer excludes any Assets pursuant to _Section
3.3(b) _and otherwise with respect to any Excluded Asset, upon request from
Seller at or after Closing, the Parties shall enter into a mutually agreeable
joint operating agreement in the form of a AAPL Form 610  1989 Joint
Operating Agreement (updated to account for horizontal pooling) with regard to
the Excluded Assets.

any out-of-pocket cost or expense, cooperate with and assist (or cause the
Company to cooperate with and assist) Seller in resolving or curing any of the

cause the Company to afford to) members of the Seller Group, upon reasonable
prior notice, access, during normal business hours or such other times as may
be reasonably accommodated by Buyer or the Company, to the Assets in order to
allow Seller or its representative to perform curative actions with respect to
any of the Air Quality Liabilities. From and after Closing, Seller shall
release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the operators of the
Assets and the members of the Buyer Group (including the Company) from and
against any and all Claims (including any injury, loss or damage arising out
of such entry that may occur) of any member of the Seller Group, arising out
of, resulting from or relating to any curative actions conducted on the Assets
by any member of the Seller Group from and after Closing with respect to the
Air Quality Liabilities, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN
WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF A MEMBER OF THE BUYER GROUP,
EXCEPTING ONLY CLAIMS ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE BUYER GROUP. In addition,
from and after Closing, Seller shall release, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each of the operators of the Assets and the members of the Buyer
Group (including the Company) from and against any and all Claims (including
any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry that may occur) arising
out of, resulting from or relating to any curative actions conducted on the
Assets by any member of the Seller Group from and after Closing with respect
to the Air Quality Liabilities to the extent (and then only to the extent)
such Claims are caused by or attributable to actions or inactions of any
member of the Seller Group.

 



 

8.16 _Suspense Funds_. No later than 10 Business Days after Closing, Seller
shall deliver a Suspense Funds schedule to Buyer to reflect the Suspense Funds
as of the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to cause the
Company to administer all accounts and assume all payment obligations relating
to the Suspense Funds taken into account when calculating the Adjusted
Purchase Price in accordance with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations
and shall be liable for the payment thereof to the proper parties. To the
extent available, Seller shall provide to Buyer detailed information with
respect to (a) payees of such Suspense Funds, (b) the reason for payment of
such Suspense Funds and (c) the time period during which such Suspense Funds
accrued.

 



      
 

 



 

8.17 _Seismic License_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Sellers
Affiliate is subject to restrictions under the Seismic License that prevent

the Seismic License to Buyer. Within five Business Days after the Execution
Date, Seller shall cause its Affiliate to contact the licensor under the
Seismic License and notify such licensor that such Affiliate is exercising its
one time right to assign the Seismic License to the Company at Closing. At
Closing, Seller shall cause its Affiliate to assign the Seismic License to the

such Data Trade Agreement is not obtained prior to Closing, from and after
Closing until the earlier of (a) the date such consent is obtained and (b)
January 31, 2018, Buyer shall provide Seller daily production and well
pressure data with respect to the Falkor 4-8 A 5LS Well (API 42-227-38756) so

11.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of _Section
11.1_, then, except for the provisions of _Article 1_, _Section 3.3(c)_
through _Section 3.3(e)_, _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.5_, _Section 4.6_,
this _Section 11.2_, _Section 11.3_ and _Article 12_ (other than _Section
12.2_, _Section 12.3_ and _Section 12.9_), which provisions shall explicitly
survive termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and the Parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder.

 



 

(b) If Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(c)_ because of (i) the Willful Breach by Buyer of this Agreement, or (ii)
the failure of Buyer to Close in the instance where, as of the Outside
Termination Date, (A) all of the conditions in _Section 9.2_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived by Buyer), (B) Seller is ready, willing and able to
perform its obligations under _Section 10.2_, and (C) Buyer nevertheless
elects not to Close, then, in either such event, Seller shall be entitled to,
at its option (1) seek specific performance in lieu of termination or (2)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_, in which case Seller
shall be entitled to receive the Deposit as liquidated damages for such
termination, free and clear of any claims thereon by Buyer, in which case the
Parties shall, within three Business Days following Sellers termination of
this Agreement, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Seller. The Parties agree
that the foregoing liquidated damages are reasonable considering all of the
circumstances existing as of the date hereof and constitute the Parties good
faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to result from such
termination of this Agreement by Seller. Seller agrees that, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, Sellers rights set forth in this _Section 11.2(b)_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller (other than with respect to
those provisions that survive termination pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_)
against Buyer and any Buyer Related Parties if the Closing does not occur as a
result of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section _

 



      
 

 



 

 _11.1(c)_ in the circumstances described in this _Section 11.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) If Buyer is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(b)_ because of (i) the Willful Breach by Seller of this Agreement, or
(ii) the failure of Seller to Close in the instance where, as of the Outside
Termination Date, (A) all of the conditions in _Section 9.1_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived by Seller), (B) Buyer is ready, willing and able to
perform its obligations under _Section 10.3_, and (C) Seller nevertheless
elects not to Close, then, in either such event, Buyer shall be entitled to,
at its option (1) seek specific performance in lieu of termination or (2)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)_ and (x) receive a
return of the Deposit, free and clear of any claims thereon by Seller (and the
Parties shall, within three Business Days following Buyers termination of
this Agreement, deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer) and (y) seek
damages up to an aggregate amount not greater than an amount equal to the
Deposit. Buyer agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyers
rights set forth in this _Section 11.2(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Buyer (other than with respect to those provisions that survive
termination pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_) if the Closing does not occur as a
result of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)_ in
the circumstances described in this _Section 11.2(c)_.

 



 

(d) If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(f)_, then Seller shall be entitled to (i) seek the specific performance
of Buyer hereunder, or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(f) _and seek to recover damages from Buyer up to an amount equal to the
amount of the Deposit; provided that upon such termination by Seller under
subpart (ii), Seller shall be free to enjoy immediately all rights of
ownership of the Company and Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or
otherwise dispose of the Assets or the Company to any Person without
restriction under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth in
_Section 11.2(b)_, Section _11.2(c)_ or _Section 11.2(d)_, then the
Parties and Buyer Related Parties shall have no liability or obligation
hereunder as a result of such termination, and the Parties shall, in writing,
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer free and
clear of any claims thereon by Seller.

 



 

(f) Subject to the foregoing, upon the termination of this Agreement neither
Party nor any Buyer Related Party shall have any other liability or obligation
hereunder.

 



 

11.3 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and Buyer
shall be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if Buyer had been a party
to the Confidentiality Agreement.

opportunity to review each and every provision contained in this Agreement and
to submit the same to legal counsel for review and comment. Moreover, the
Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this

construction that a contract be construed against the drafter, if any, not be
applied in the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

 



 

12.13 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, all
of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any
signature hereto or to an amendment hereof delivered by a Party by electronic

signature hereto or thereto.

 



 

12.14 _Entire Agreement; Conflicts_. THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXHIBITS AND
SCHEDULES HERETO AND THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE
ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF
AND SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, NEGOTIATIONS AND
DISCUSSIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OF THE PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER
AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, AND NO PARTY SHALL BE BOUND BY OR LIABLE FOR ANY ALLEGED
REPRESENTATION, PROMISE, INDUCEMENT OR STATEMENTS OF INTENTION NOT SO SET
FORTH. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN: (A) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO,
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; OR (B)
THE TERMS AND PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN
AND CONTROL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES OR

representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance.
No course of dealing on the part of any Party, or their respective officers,
employees, agents or representatives, and no failure by a Party to exercise

 



       
 

 



 

any of its rights under this Agreement shall, in either case, operate as a
waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to
enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by any Party of any
condition or any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty. The rights of the Parties under this
Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

 



 

12.16 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.
