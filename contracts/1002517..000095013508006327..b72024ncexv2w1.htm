RECITALS 

   

 A.

The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Parent and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §§1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. 

  

 C. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth herein. 

  

 D. A portion of the consideration payable in connection with the First Step Merger shall be placed in escrow as security for the indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 E. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Subs, on the other hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Integrated Merger. 

  

 F. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent and the Subs to enter into this Agreement, all officers and directors of the Company, and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into Voting and No-Hire Agreements, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting and No-Hire 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreements"), with Parent, pursuant to which such stockholders have
irrevocably agreed (i) to vote in favor of the Integrated Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement and the date which is twenty-four (24) months from
the Effective Time (as defined below), not to hire any individual who is an
employee of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, and (iii) to other
matters set forth therein. 

  

 G. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain individuals are entering into offer letters and Employee Proprietary Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreements, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Employee Proprietary Information, Inventions and Non-Competition Agreements"), with Parent or the Final Surviving Entity, as determined by Parent.

 (viii) If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of the Plan or the terms of any Company Option, Company RSU, or Company Incentive Option agreement, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, (i) provide any notices to and obtain any consents from holders of Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company Incentive Options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to give effect to the provisions of this Section 1.6(c). It is intended that the assumption of the Company Options and Company Incentive Options by Parent and each Assumed Option and Assumed Incentive Option shall comply with Section 424 of the Code and shall also be considered by Parent and the Company to be in good faith compliance with respect to Section 409A of the Code. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Final Surviving Entity agree that the treatment of the Company Options, the Company RSUs, the Company Incentive Options, the Assumed Options, the Assumed Units, the Assumed Incentive Options and any payments to any holder made in the manner set forth 

   ##### 

  

    

in this Section 1.6(c) is either exempt from or in compliance with the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code, as the case may be, and none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving
Entity shall take any action that is inconsistent with such agreement. The
Company shall take no action, other than those actions contemplated by this
Agreement, which will cause or result in the accelerated vesting of the
Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Incentive Options. As soon as
practicable after each of the Effective Time and, with respect to
Assumed Options, the Earnout Payment Date, Parent shall deliver to the holder
of each Company Option, Company RSU and Company Incentive Option, as
applicable, appropriate notices setting forth the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option, Assumed Incentive Option and
Assumed Unit then held by each such holder and the per share exercise price
under each such Assumed Option and Assumed Incentive Option. 

  

 (ix) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Incentive Options pursuant to this Section 1.6(c), including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.6(c). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC on or prior to the 5th Business Day following the Closing Date with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options, Assumed Units and Assumed Incentive Options and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed Options, Assumed Units and Assumed Incentive Options remain outstanding. To the extent that shares of Parent Common Stock become issuable as a result of adjustments to Assumed Options made pursuant to Section 1.6(c)(ii) and Section 1.6(c)(iii) and such shares are not registered on the original Form S-8 filed with the SEC for the Assumed Options, Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or an amendment to the previously filed Form S-8 for the Assumed Options if permitted by applicable law) with respect to such additional shares of Parent Common Stock covered by such adjustments on or prior to the Earnout Payment Date and to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed Options remain outstanding. 

  

 (x) Parent may assume, in its sole and absolute discretion, the Plan, with such assumption being effective as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that if Parent assumes Company Options and/or Company Incentive Options, Parent shall assume the Plan. Upon receipt of written notice from Parent confirming its intent to assume the Plan, the Company shall take such actions prior to the Effective Time as are reasonable and appropriate to effect the provisions of this Section 1.6(c)(x), including, without limitation, (i) taking such actions as may be required to confirm that the Board of Directors of Parent (or any of its committees) shall, effective as of the Effective Time, become the administrator of the assumed Plan and shall have any and all amendment authority with respect thereto, (ii) taking such actions as may be required to effect the grant of Company RSUs and Company Incentive Options, including taking such actions as may be required pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 5.11 hereto and (iii) adopting such amendments and obtaining such
consents as may be required to effect the assumption of the Plan contemplated
by this Section 1.6(c)(x). 

  

 (d) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. The Company shall take all necessary actions (including providing all required notices) to ensure that all outstanding Company Warrants are exercised or terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent, the Company, the Subs, the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.9) and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct and withhold Taxes (as defined in Section 2.11) from any payments to be made hereunder (including with respect to the Final Earnout Amount, if any) if such withholding is required by law and to request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Stockholders and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Stockholder or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (f) _Capital Stock of Subs_. Each share of Common Stock of Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub I evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation. Each share of Common Stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for the applicable corresponding interest of the Final Surviving Entity. Each stock certificate of the Interim Surviving Corporation evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence the applicable corresponding interest in the Final Surviving Entity. 

   

 (g) _Treatment of UK Company Options_. The Company shall notify each holder of UK Company Vested Options that he or she has the right to exercise his or her UK Company Vested Options prior to the Effective Time and that, to the extent that such holder exercises such UK Company Vested Options, such holder will participate in the Merger in accordance with Section 1.6(b). If a UK Company Vested Option is not timely exercised after such notice from the Company it shall be treated as all other Company Options as set out in Section 1.6(c) as an Assumed Option or a Cashed Out-Option. UK Company Unvested Options shall also be treated as Assumed Options or as Cashed Out-Options as set out in Section 1.6(c). 

   

 1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.  

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has not voted for the Merger, who shall have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a) hereof, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares, and shall thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement (provided, that such payment, if made after the Effective Time other than pursuant to court direction under Section 262(i) of Delaware Law, has been approved by the Stockholder Representative, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably) or (ii) reasonably incurs any other costs or expenses (including specifically, but without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding or in connection with any investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) (together "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled to recover under the terms of Section 7.2 hereof the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments without regard to the Threshold Amount (as defined in Section 7.4(a) hereof). 

   

 1.8 _Parent s Obligations Fulfilled_.  

  

 (a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent an updated version of Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and thereafter within two (2) Business Days from the time Parent deposits the Earnout Consideration, if any, with the Exchange Agent under this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent 

   ##### 

  

   

and the Exchange Agent a schedule (each, a "Payment Schedule") setting forth
(i) the name and address of each Stockholder/former Stockholder entitled to
distribution of Merger Consideration at such time and (ii) the amount of
consideration to which each such Stockholder/former Stockholder is
then entitled, together with any supporting schedules and documentation
(showing the number and type of shares held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by each such holder, together with calculations of the amount
then payable to such holder). Parent and the Exchange Agent may rely on the
Payment Schedule for distributions and shall have no responsibility or
liability with respect thereto other than the payment and delivery of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with the Payment Schedule. Upon Parent or
the Exchange Agent making each distribution required of Parent under this
Agreement to the Stockholders/former Stockholders, Parent shall have
fulfilled its obligations with respect to such payment. 

   

 1.9 _Surrender of Certificates_.  

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent, or an institution selected by Parent prior to the Effective Time and reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder Representative, shall serve as the exchange agent (Parent in such capacity, or such institution, the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger. 

   

 (b) _Parent to Provide Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(b) relating to escrow arrangements, promptly following the Effective Time, and on the Earnout Payment Date (if any), as applicable, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE I the consideration payable at such times pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; _provided, however,_ that, Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund (as defined in Section 7.3(a) hereof) the shares of Parent Common Stock that comprise the Escrow Amount out of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof. The Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Parent Common Stock comprising the Escrow Amount shall be deemed to be contributed to the Escrow Fund with respect to each Stockholder. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to the distribution of such payments among the Stockholders/former Stockholders of the Company provided that such payments are in accordance with the Payment Schedule. 

   

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. On or after the Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall cause the Exchange Agent to) mail a letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, (the "Letter of Transmittal") to each Stockholder at the address set forth opposite each such Stockholders name on Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. After receipt of such Letter of Transmittal, the Stockholders will surrender the certificates representing their shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") to the Exchange Agent for cancellation together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, subject to the terms 

   ##### 

  

   

of Section 1.9(e) hereof, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor, Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof
(less the Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to be deposited into
the Escrow Fund with respect to such Stockholder), and the Company
Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so surrendered,
each Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be
deemed, for all corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6 hereof in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock (without
interest) into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so
converted. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares of
Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of record
of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company
Stock Certificate pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.9
to the contrary, if a record holder, on an aggregate basis together with all
affiliates of such record holder, holds at least 150,000 shares of
Company Capital Stock and surrenders to Parent or the Exchange Agent (i) a
duly executed Letter of Transmittal and (ii) the applicable Company Stock
Certificates held by such holder, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, and such holder is the record holder of such
Company Capital Stock as of the Closing Date, then the holder of such Company
Stock Certificates shall be entitled to receive, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the Closing Date certificate(s) evidencing the Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof
(less the Escrow Amount to be deposited into the Escrow Fund with respect
to such Stockholder). 

   

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company Capital Stock. 

   

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, or if any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof to a person other than the person or entity whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it 

   ##### 

  

   

any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been
paid or is not payable. 

   

 (f) _Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time following the last day of the respective six (6) month period following each of the Effective Time and the Earnout Payment Date (if any), as applicable, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all shares of Parent Common Stock and cash that have been deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.9(b) hereof, and any income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.9(c) hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms of Section 1.9(g) hereof) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof upon the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates in the manner set forth in Section 1.9(c) hereof. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.9, neither the Exchange Agent, the Final Surviving Entity, nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Final Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Final Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE I. 

  

 1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as it may reasonably direct or (ii) provide an indemnification agreement in a reasonable and customary form acceptable to Parent, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.12 _Reorganization Status_. The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. None of the parties hereto have taken, will take or will cause to be taken, any action, except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, that reasonably could be expected to cause the Integrated Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 1.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Final Surviving Entity with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, the Subs, and the officers and directors of the Company, Parent and the Subs are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 2.12 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not entered into any agreement under which the Company is restricted from selling, licensing, manufacturing or otherwise distributing any of its technology or products or from providing services to customers or potential customers or any class of customers, in any geographic area, during any period of time, or in any segment of the market. 

  

 2.13 _Title to Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) The Company does not own any real property, nor has the Company ever owned any real property. Section 2.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company or otherwise used or occupied by the Company for the operation of its business (the "Leased Real Property"), the name of the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master lessor and/or lessee, the date and term of the lease, license, sublease or other occupancy right and each amendment thereto (the "Lease Agreements") and, with respect to any current lease, license, sublease or other occupancy right the aggregate annual rental payable thereunder. All such Lease Agreements are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default by the Company, no rentals are past due, or event of default by the Company (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Company). The Company has not received any written notice of a default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset or counterclaim with respect to any such Lease Agreement, which has not been fully remedied and withdrawn. To the Companys Knowledge, the Closing will not affect the enforceability against any person of any such Lease Agreement or the rights of the Company to the continued use and possession of the Leased Real Property for the conduct of business as presently conducted. 

   

 (b) To the Companys Knowledge, the Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear), free from structural, physical and mechanical defects and is structurally sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the business as presently conducted. To the Companys Knowledge, neither the operation of the Company on the Leased Real Property nor such Leased Real Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions. The Company does not owe any brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company has performed all of its obligations under any termination agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements for real property that are no longer in effect and has no continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is reasonably likely to be required to expend more than $25,000 in causing any Leased Real Property to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the applicable Lease Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Company has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except (i) as reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, (ii) Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, and (iii) such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which do not materially detract from the value or interfere with the present use of the property subject thereto or affected thereby.

business. Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, nor the
carrying on of the Companys business as presently conducted or proposed to
be conducted nor any activity of such Employees in connection with the
carrying on of the Companys business as presently conducted or currently
proposed to be conducted will, to the Knowledge of the Company, conflict with
or result in a breach of the terms, conditions, or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, any contract or agreement under which any of such
Employees is now bound. 

   

 (o) _International Employee Plan_. Each International Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that are applicable to such International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by law, no condition exists that would prevent the Company or Parent from terminating or amending any International Employee Plan in accordance with its terms, without material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than ordinary administration expenses and payment of accrued benefits). 

   

 2.23 _Insurance_.

There is no claim by the Company pending under any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been denied or disputed or that the Company has a reason to believe will be denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. In addition, there is no pending insurance claim against the Company of which its total value (inclusive of defense expenses) is reasonably likely to exceed the policy limits. All premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid (or if installment payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the Closing Date) and the Company is otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such policies and bonds. The Company has no Knowledge of threatened termination of, or premium increase with respect to, any of such policies. The Company has never maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any self-insurance plan.

assistance to Parent in preparing the 701 Disclosure. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Company RSUs

The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent and the Company may agree upon. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

The number of shares of Parent Common Stock that may be held back in respect of the Escrow Holdback Amount shall be based on the Signing Price. As soon as all such claims have been resolved in accordance with Section 7.4(d), the Escrow Agent shall deliver the portion of the Escrow Holdback Amount not required to satisfy such claims to the Stockholders. Deliveries of amounts out of the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) shall be made in proportion to their respective Escrow Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow Amount, with the number of shares delivered to each Stockholder rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Any distribution of all or a portion of the Parent Common Stock to the Stockholders shall be made by delivery of the stock certificate held by the Escrow Agent representing the Parent Common Stock to the Parent, endorsed for transfer, with instruction to the Parent to transfer and issue, or cause its transfer agent to transfer and issue, the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock being distributed, allocated among the Stockholders based upon his, her or its Escrow Pro Rata Portion, in each case by issuing to each such Stockholder a stock certificate representing such allocated shares, registered in his, her or its name set forth on the schedule delivered to the Escrow Agent at Closing and mailed by first class mail to such Stockholders address set forth on such schedule (or to such 

     ##### 

  

    

other address as such Stockholder may have previously instructed the Escrow
Agent in writing); and, if less than all the then remaining shares of Parent
Common Stock are to be so distributed and transferred as a result of the
retention in the Escrow Fund of an Escrow Holdback Amount in accordance with
this Section 7.3(b), the Escrow Agent shall instruct Parent to issue and
return to the Escrow Agent (or its nominee, if the Escrow Agent shall so
instruct) a stock certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
representing the Escrow Holdback Amount. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the distribution of the shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting the Escrow Amount to which to the Stockholders are
entitled to be effected promptly after the Escrow Period termination date,
or, in the case an Escrow Holdback Amount is held back in accordance with
this Section 7.3(b), promptly after the claims relating to such Escrow
Holdback Amount have been resolved in accordance with Section 7.4(d). The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability for the actions or omissions of, or any
delay on the part of, Parent in connection with the foregoing. 

   

 (c) _Protection of Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.3(c). 

  

 (ii) The Interested Parties agree that, for Tax reporting purposes, all interest and other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Fund in any Tax year shall, (A) to the extent such interest or other income is distributed by the Escrow Agent to any person or entity pursuant to the terms of this Agreement during such tax year, be reported as allocated to such person or entity and, (B) otherwise, be reported as allocated to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Escrow Pro Rata Portions. 

  

 (iii) Each of the Interested Parties hereto agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Interested Parties understand that, in the event their tax identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Amount. Each of the Interested Parties agrees to instruct the Escrow Agent in writing with respect to the Escrow Agents responsibility for withholding and other taxes, assessments or other governmental charges, and to instruct the Escrow Agent with respect to any certifications and governmental reporting that may be required under any laws or regulations that may be applicable in connection with its acting as Escrow Agent under this Agreement. 

  

 (iv) Neither the Escrow Agent nor its nominee shall be under any duty to take any action to preserve, protect, exercise or enforce any rights or remedies under or with respect to the Parent Common Stock (including without limitation with respect 

   ##### 

  

 

to the exercise of any voting or consent rights, conversion or exchange
rights, defense of title, preservation of rights against prior matters or
otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Stockholders shall have
voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed
to and held in the Escrow Fund on behalf of such Stockholder (and on any
voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of
Parent Common Stock). The Escrow Agent shall from time to time deliver such
proxies, consents and other materials and documents as may be necessary to
enable the Stockholders to exercise such voting rights, and shall instruct
the Stockholders to return any instructions with respect to such voting
rights to the Escrow Agent, who shall tabulate all votes received by the
Stockholders and shall vote on their behalf in accordance with the
instructions given by each such Stockholder. In the absence of instructions
by any such Stockholder, the Escrow Agent shall not vote any of the shares
held on behalf of such Stockholder. 

   

 (v) Cash dividends, cash returned by the Stockholder Representative and any non-cash taxable dividends or distributions (other than New Shares as defined below), on any shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Stockholders according to their Escrow Pro Rata Portion, and shall not become a part of the Escrow Fund. Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or distributed by Parent after the Effective Time (including shares issued upon a nontaxable stock split) ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. The parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that the Stockholders are the owners of any stock in the Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof. 

  

 7.4 _Indemnification Claims_.  

  

 (a) _Threshold Amount_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 7.4(a), an Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and until one or more Officers Certificates (as defined below) identifying such Losses under Section 7.2(a)(i) in excess of $1,800,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold Amount") has or have been delivered to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.4(b) hereof, in which case Parent shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified without regard to the Threshold Amount from the first dollar of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to (A) all Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (ii) (other Losses relating to breaches of Section 4.1), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 7.2 hereof, and (B) Losses resulting from any breach of representation or warranty contained in Section 2.2 (Company Capital Structure). 

      ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 7.2, Parent shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent to be received by them at any time on or before the Survival Date; _provided, however_ , Parent may seek indemnification (i) for a breach of a representation and warranty of the Company contained in Section 2.2 hereof, by delivering an Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) for a breach of a representation and warranty of the Company contained in Section 2.11 hereof, by delivering an Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Unless the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.4(c) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirty-fifth (35th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate. Any payment from the Escrow Fund to Indemnified Parties shall be made in whole shares of Parent Common Stock (valuing each share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Signing Price) and shall be deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the Stockholders based on the aggregate amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund on each such Stockholders behalf. For the purposes hereof, "Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (1) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur or accrue, Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under Section 7.2, (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related, and (3) specifying the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Losses. In the event that Parent, in accordance with Section 7.3(b), shall deliver an Officers Certificate for Losses in excess of the available Escrow Fund, any Earnout Consideration that may become payable pursuant to ARTICLE VIII hereof shall not be paid to the Exchange Agent to the extent that the Losses claimed in such Officers Certificate exceed the available Escrow Fund but would not result in the limit of liability set forth in Section 7.6 to be exceeded (the amount of such Losses in excess of the available Escrow Fund, subject to and not to exceed the limitations set forth in Section 7.6, being referred as the "Excess Losses"), until such claim contained in such Officers Certificate shall be resolved in accordance with this Section 7.4. 

   

 (c) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. No such payment shall be made under Section 7.4(b) if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officers Certificate (an "Objection Notice"), and such Objection Notice shall have been received by Parent and the Escrow Agent on or prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders hereby waive the right to object to any claims in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss (as defined in Section 7.4(d)(iii) hereof). If the Stockholder Representative does not object in writing to the claim made in the Officers Certificate within such 30-day period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder 

     ##### 

  

    

Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of
the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate, and payment in
respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with Section
7.4(b). 

   

 (d) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

   

 (i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c) (other than Agreed-Upon Losses as defined in Section 7.4(d)(iii) hereof), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice by the Stockholder Representative to Parent or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to Section 8.3, either Parent, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, may pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies available to them under applicable law. 

  

 (iii) This Section 7.4(d) shall not apply to claims made in respect of (A) any Dissenting Share Payments (as defined in Section 1.7(c)), (B) any Excess Third Party Expenses (as defined in Section 5.4), (C) any Closing Cash Deficit (as defined in Section 5.4) or (D) any Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification Expenses pursuant to clauses (vi) and (vii) of Section 7.4(g) hereof (each, an "Agreed-Upon Loss"). Claims against the Escrow Fund made in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss shall be resolved in the manner described in Section 7.3(b) above. 

  

 (e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, Parent shall notify the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative of such claim. If the Third Party Claim may result in a claim against the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders, shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in and make recommendations with respect to, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholders agree and consent, as a condition of such entitlement of participation, that Parents legal counsel in the Third Party Claim shall not be precluded from representing Parent as against the Stockholders in the event that the Stockholders dispute the fact or amount of the Parents claim of a Loss related to the Third-Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim, _provided, however_ that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the 

     ##### 

  

    

amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of any
Third Party Claim by Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if Parent does not notify the Stockholder Representative in
its notice provided under the first sentence of this Section 7.4(e), or by
separate notice within five (5) Business Days thereafter, that it has assumed
the defense of the Third Party Claim, or notifies the Stockholder
Representative that it has elected not to assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to assume
and conduct the defense of such claim at its expense;  _provided, however_ ,
that the Stockholder Representative shall not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such claim unless
such judgment or settlement requires solely the payment of money damages not
in excess of the amount available in the Escrow Fund and such judgment or
settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the release by
the claimant or the plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, this Section 7.4(e) shall not apply to any third party claim
that is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss. 

   

 (f) _Claims for Stockholder Representative Expenses_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will deposit with the Escrow Agent the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback, which shall serve as a source of funds for paying or reimbursing Stockholder Representative Expenses (as defined in Section 7.5(b). The Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback shall be invested in the Escrow Agents Insured Money Market Account as described in Exhibit I hereto. In order to seek Stockholder Representative Expenses, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a certificate (a "Stockholder Representatives Certificate") to the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the Survival Date. Such Stockholder Representatives Certificate shall set forth the amount of the Stockholder Representative Expenses for which reimbursement or advance is requested and shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such Stockholder Representative Expenses. Within five (5) Business Days after the Escrow Agents receipt of a Stockholder Representative Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a check in an amount equal to the amount of Stockholder Representative Expenses set forth in such certificate; provided that in no event shall the Escrow Agent be required to pay any Stockholder Representative Expenses in excess of the amount of the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback (and any undistributed earnings thereon) then held by the Escrow Agent. If the Stockholder Representative makes a claim for the advance of any expenses pursuant to this Section 7.4(f) and any portion of such expenses are not actually incurred, the Stockholder Representative shall promptly return the amount so advanced (or the proceeds from the sale of any shares of Parent Common Stock that have been sold to raise cash) to the Escrow Agent to be returned to the Escrow Fund and either held or distributed in accordance with this Agreement. To the extent that any portion of Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback has not been paid to the Stockholder Representative or is not subject to a Stockholder Representative Certificate delivered on or before the Survival Date, such portion (together with any undistributed earnings thereon) shall be 

      ##### 

  

    

distributed to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Escrow
Pro Rata Portions promptly after the Survival Date. 

   

 (g) _Escrow Agent s Duties_. 

   

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder Representative and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, or, in the reasonable opinion of Escrow Agent, will not result in additional obligations or liabilities to the Escrow Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agents duties hereunder are ministerial in nature and shall not be deemed fiduciary. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. 

  

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction. 

  

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder. 

  

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses (including investment losses resulting from liquidating a position in the Money Market Account), or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in 

   ##### 

  

 

this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with
legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under
this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying
the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any
party to this Agreement. 

   

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Fund held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders respective Escrow Pro Rata Portions; _provided, however_ , that in the event any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portions directly from the Escrow Fund; _provided, however_ , that in the event the Stockholders portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses cannot be satisfied from the Escrow Fund in full, the parties agree that Parent shall pay the shortfall of such Stockholders portion of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Agent Indemnification Expenses, and shall be entitled to recover such amount
from each Stockholder equal to such Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion of
such amount without regard to any caps or other limits herein. 

   

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of New York or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent and shall remain the escrow agent until such order is received. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement. 

  

 (ix) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, or in carrying out any sale of the Escrow Fund permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account. 

  

 (x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any provision seeking to limit the liability of the Escrow Agent shall not be applicable in the event such liability arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (xi) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any of the Escrow Fund (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form, or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be. 

  

 (xii) The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, terrorism, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) _Fees_. All fees (including attorneys fees) of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent previously delivered to Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation. 

   

 (i) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation or other entity into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or other entity to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act. 

   

 (j) _Customer Identification Program_ _._ Each of the Interested Parties acknowledge receipt of the notice set forth on Exhibit J attached hereto and made part hereof and that information may be requested to verify their identities. 

   

 7.5 _Stockholder Representative_.  

  

 (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Thomas S. Huseby as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such 

     ##### 

  

    

agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that
the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-
thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity
of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and
the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Stockholders. 

   

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Stockholders shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel, accountant or other professional adviser retained by the Stockholder Representative ("Stockholder Representative Expenses"). A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

   

 7.6 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_.  

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Sections 7.6(b), 7.6(c) and 7.6(d) hereof, the maximum amount an Indemnified Party may recover from a Stockholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in Section 7.2 hereof for Losses shall be limited to: (i) the amounts held in the Escrow Fund with respect to such Stockholder, and (ii) to the extent of any Excess Losses, such Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion of such Excess Losses (not to exceed such Stockholders Consideration Pro Rata Portion of the first $4,500,000 of Earnout Consideration earned, whether or not yet paid to such Stockholder pursuant to ARTICLE VIII of this Agreement.

     ##### 

  

    

be limited to such Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Loss
attributable to such fraud or intentional breach, not to exceed such
Stockholders Consideration Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration
actually received (including, without duplication, the amount contributed to
the Escrow on behalf of such Stockholder). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Stockholders in respect of Losses arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.2 or Section 2.11; _provided, however_ , that the maximum amount an Indemnified Party may recover from each Stockholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in Section 7.2 in respect of any such breach shall be limited to such Stockholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Loss attributable to such breach, not to exceed such Stockholders Consideration Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration actually received (including, without duplication, the amount contributed to the Escrow on behalf of such Stockholder). 

   

 (d) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement if the Merger does not close. 

   

 (e) From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of each Stockholder to Parent and the other Indemnified Parties under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or obligation or for any other reason), shall be as set forth in this ARTICLE VII. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 

   

EARNOUT  

  

 8.1 _Earnout Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) _Earnout Generally_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Companys projected Billings (as such term is defined in Annex A attached hereto) (as described below) are material factors in determining the valuation of the Company by Parent. Therefore, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall retain a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to the Earnout Consideration otherwise payable at the Effective Time to the Stockholders and shall treat such Earnout Consideration in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII. 

   

 (b) _Earnout as Merger Consideration_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Earnout Consideration is intended to be consideration for shares of capital stock of the Company, rather than compensation for services. All calculations of payments to be made pursuant to 

     ##### 

  

    

Section 1.6 shall disregard any portion of the Earnout Consideration not yet
earned in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII. 

   

 (c) _Distribution of Earnout_. 

   

 (i) In the event Parent delivers an Earnout Notice (as defined in Section 8.3 hereof) stating that Earnout Consideration has been earned pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, subject to Section 8.1(c)(ii) hereof, Parent shall distribute (or cause the Exchange Agent to distribute) the Earnout Consideration set forth in the Earnout Notice to the former Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.6(b). 

  

 (ii) In the event Parent delivers an Earnout Notice stating that Earnout Consideration has been earned pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, and Parent has a claim or claims outstanding for Excess Losses, Parent shall distribute (or cause the Exchange Agent to distribute) the Earnout Consideration in excess of such claimed Excess Losses to the former Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.6(b), and the Earnout Consideration to the extent of such claimed Excess Losses shall be retained by Parent, and any such amounts in dispute shall either be (A) distributed to the former Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.6(b), or (B) permanently retained by Parent, as the case maybe, upon resolution of such dispute in accordance with Section 7.4(b). 

  

 (iii) In the event any Billings are collected after the Earnout Payment Date (the "Delayed Collections"), Parent shall distribute (or cause the Exchange Agent to distribute), promptly (and not more than thirty (30) days after such collection) to the former Stockholders any additional Earnout Consideration earned as a result of such Delayed Collections, in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and this ARTICLE VIII (each, an "Additional Earnout Payment"). 

  

 (iv) With respect to disputes of amounts contained in the Earnout Notice, upon the final determination of such portion of the Earnout Consideration in dispute determined to be due and payable to the Stockholders in accordance with Section 7.4(b), Parent shall distribute (or cause the Exchange Agent to distribute) the Earnout Consideration, if any, as so finally determined to be payable to the Stockholders not theretofore delivered as soon as practicable but in any event within five (5) Business Days of such resolution, subject to subparagraph (ii) above. 

  

 (v) For the purpose of calculating the Earnout Amount, in the event that any party to the VF Contract (as such term is defined in Annex A attached hereto), the TM Contract (as such term is defined in Annex A attached hereto) or any Campaign Contract (as such term is defined in Annex A attached hereto) asserts, prior to the Earnout Determination Date, a right to repayment of amounts previously paid by such customer with respect to license or maintenance fees under the VF Contract, the TM Contract or any Campaign Contract, the aggregate amount of Billings shall be reduced by the amount in dispute pending resolution of such assertion. Upon final resolution of such assertion, Billings and the related Earnout Amount shall be appropriately adjusted 

   ##### 

  

 

to reflect such resolution, and Parent shall distribute (or cause the
Exchange Agent to distribute) the additional Earnout Consideration, if any,
as so finally determined to be payable to the Stockholders, as soon
as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of such resolution. 

   

 (d) _Forfeited Amounts_. All Earnout Consideration that is not earned by the Stockholders pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII will be forfeited and retained permanently by Parent. 

   

 8.2 _Earnout Determination_. The Final Earnout Amount shall be calculated on a linear scale based on Billings of between $0 and the Earnout Billings Target (as such term is defined in Annex A attached hereto) during the Earnout Period, with the Final Earnout Amount being equal to zero ($0) if Billings equal $0 and equal to $45 million if Billings equal the Earnout Billings Target. By way of further example and for the avoidance of doubt, if Billings during the Earnout Period were equal to 80% of the Earnout Billings Target, the Final Earnout Amount would equal $36 million. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Final Earnout Amount exceed the Earnout Consideration. 

  

 8.3 _Calculation of Earnout Distributions; Stockholder Representative Objections_. 

  

 (a) _Earnout Distribution_. On or prior to the Earnout Determination Date, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a memorandum (the "Earnout Notice") specifying in reasonable detail the calculation of the portion of the Earnout Consideration earned, if any, and the calculation of the distribution of the Final Earnout Amount to each of the Stockholders pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII and Section 1.6, if any, with the basis for such calculation, in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, as applicable, and, if applicable, any proposed set off for Excess Losses in accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii). Parent agrees that it will supply any reasonably requested back up or supporting information to the Stockholder Representative or its accountants on which the Earnout calculations are based; _provided, however_ , that the provision of any such back up or supporting information shall be conditioned upon the execution of a confidentiality agreement in a form acceptable to Parent. If the Stockholder Representative gives written notice to Parent that such Stockholder Representative is in agreement with the Earnout Notice, then the Earnout Notice shall become final. 

   

 (b) _Stockholder Representative Objection_. The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days to make an objection (in writing) to any item in the Earnout Notice, and such statement must be delivered to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty-day (30-day) period. If no such objection has been delivered to Parent within such thirty-day (30-day) period, the Earnout Notice shall become final. 

   

 (c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. At any time following delivery of an objection pursuant to Section 8.3(b), or the expiration of the thirty-day (30-day) period for doing so, either 

      ##### 

  

    

party may elect to resolve any dispute regarding the Earnout Consideration in
the manner set forth in Section 7.4(d). 

   

 (d) _Earnout Rights Not Transferable_. No Stockholder may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of the Earnout Consideration, other than by the laws of descent and distribution or succession, and any transfer in violation of this Section 8.3(d) shall be null and void and shall not be recognized by Parent or the Final Surviving Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Stockholder that is a limited partnership, limited liability company, corporation, trust or other entity shall have the right to assign its rights to receive the Earnout Consideration to any affiliated entities within the same fund family or corporate group. Parent shall maintain, or cause to be maintained by its agent, a register (the "Register") on which it enters the name and address of each Person that has a right to receive any portion of the Earnout Consideration (each, and "Earnout Interest"). Any Earnout Interest may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register. Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Earnout Interest, Parent shall treat the Person in whose name such Earnout Interest is registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes. 

   

 (e) _Parent Successor Obligations for Earnout Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event Parent shall consummate any transaction pursuant to which all or substantially all of the business, properties or assets of Parent are transferred to another person not directly or indirectly controlled by Parent, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise (an "Acquisition Transaction"), the Final Earnout Amount shall be paid in cash. 

   

 (f) _Earnout Protections_. 

   

 (i) Parent shall provide sufficient resources to the Company, consistent with the Companys current operating plan as provided to Parent, to allow the Company to fulfill its obligations under the VF Contract, the TM Contract, and any Campaign Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall have (A) the ability to react in Parents good faith discretion to business conditions as they occur or as they become known and (B) to integrate the businesses in order to optimize the performance of the combined business. Parent will not take any action the principal purpose of which is to circumvent or adversely affect the Companys ability to achieve the Earnout Billings Target. 

  

 (ii) In the event that during the Earnout Period, Parent shall consummate an Acquisition Transaction, and in connection with such Acquisition Transaction, either the TM Contract or the VF Contract is terminated, that portion of the Earnout Billings Target that is attributable to such terminated contract shall be deemed to have been achieved in full.

##### 

 

   

 (iii) In the event that during the Earnout Period, there shall be an amendment to or renegotiation of either the TM Contract or the VF Contract that would adversely affect the Companys ability to generate Billings, including any adverse change in the Companys deliverables or requirements under such contracts, Parent shall make commensurate adjustment to the Billings Target. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

REGISTRATION  

  

 9.1 _Filing and Effectiveness of Stockholder Registration Statement_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, within five (5) Business Days after the Closing, either a registration statement on Form S-3 (or other appropriate form if Form S-3 is not available) or a prospectus supplement to an effective registration statement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act covering the resale to the public by the Stockholders of all shares representing the Closing Consideration (the "Stockholder Registration Statement") with the SEC as soon as practicable. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Stockholder Registration Statement to be automatically effective upon filing, or if automatic effectiveness is not available, to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable and use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Stockholders in allowing sales of shares representing the Closing Consideration to occur pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement; provided that Parent shall not be required to make any filing with the SEC prior to the date that such filing otherwise would be due other than Parents Form 8-K containing the required financial statements of the Company and the pro-forma financial statements required in connection with the Merger (the "Form 8-K"). Parent will file the Form 8-K, including the required financial statements of the Company and the pro-forma financial statements required in connection with the Merger, within four (4) Business Days after the Closing, _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall have no obligation to file the Form 8-K until Parent shall have received all required consents from the Companys auditors. Parent shall cause the Stockholder Registration Statement to remain available for use until the earlier of (a) one (1) year after the later of the date such Stockholder Registration Statement is effective or the Closing Date and (b) such time as all of the Closing Consideration covered by the Registration Statement has been sold pursuant thereto. Parent shall pay the expenses incurred by it in complying with its obligations under this Section 9.1 including, without limitation, all preparation, registration, filing fees, costs and expenses, all exchange listing fees, all fees, costs and expenses of counsel for Parent, accountants for Parent and other advisors or persons retained by Parent in connection with the filing of the Stockholder Registration Statement, but excluding (i) any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting discounts incurred by the Stockholders in connection with sales under the Stockholder Registration Statement, and (ii) the fees and expenses of any accountants or attorneys retained by the Stockholders other than fees and related disbursements of up to $10,000 for one counsel selected by a majority in interest of the Stockholders. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.2 _Limitations on Registration Rights_.  

  

 (a) Parent may, by written notice to the Stockholders, (i) delay the filing or effectiveness of the Stockholder Registration Statement, or (ii) suspend the Stockholder Registration Statement after effectiveness and require that the Stockholders immediately cease sales of the Closing Consideration pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement, in the event that (1) Parent files a registration statement (other than a registration statement on Form S-8 or any successor form) or a prospectus supplement to an effective registration statement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC for a public offering of its securities for its own behalf, (2) Parent is engaged in any activity or transaction or preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction that Parent desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if Parent determines in good faith that the public disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the Stockholder Registration Statement would require disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or negotiations, or (3) Parent determines in good faith that the public disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the Stockholder Registration Statement would require Parent to file any information or materials with the SEC prior to the date that such information or materials otherwise would be required to be filed, other than the Form 8-K in connection with the Merger. 

  

 (b) If Parent delays or suspends the Stockholder Registration Statement or requires the Stockholders to cease sales of Closing Consideration pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Stockholder Registration Statement (with such Stockholder Registration Statement staying effective and remaining effective for the period contemplated by Section 9.1 above) and/or give written notice to all Stockholders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the Stockholder Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice to Stockholders given pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), and the Stockholders shall make no offers or sales of Closing Consideration pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not suspend the Stockholder Registration Statement pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof (i) at all during the first two weeks following its effectiveness, or (ii) for more than sixty (60) days (a "Registration Suspension"), and provided further that Parent shall not cause more than two Registration Suspensions in any twelve (12) month period. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.3 _Registration Procedures and Other Requirements_.  

  

 (a) In connection with the filing by Parent of the Stockholder Registration Statement, Parent shall furnish to each Stockholder a copy of the prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify all shares representing the Closing Consideration covered by the Stockholder Registration Statement under the securities laws of each state of the United States; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required in connection with this subparagraph to qualify as a foreign corporation or execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction, except as required by the Securities Act. 

  

 (c) Parent shall notify all Stockholders when the Stockholder Registration Statement has become effective and anytime when resales must cease or may be resumed. 

  

 (d) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Stockholder Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act. 

  

 (e) If Parent has delivered preliminary or final prospectuses to the Stockholders and after having done so the prospectus is amended or supplemented to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders and, if requested by Parent, the Stockholders shall immediately cease making offers or sales of shares representing the Closing Consideration under the Stockholder Registration Statement and return all prospectuses to Parent. Parent shall promptly provide the Stockholders with revised or supplemented prospectuses and, following receipt of the revised or supplemented prospectuses, the Stockholders shall be free to resume making offers and sales under the Stockholder Registration Statement. 

  

 (f) Parent shall cause all Closing Consideration to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by Parent are then listed. 

  

 (g) If necessary, Parent shall provide a transfer agent, registrar and CUSIP number for the Closing Consideration, in each case not later than the effective date of the Stockholder Registration Statement. 

  

 (h) During the Registration Period, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to file all such periodic, current and other reports and filings with the SEC as may be necessary to (i) maintain eligibility to use Form S-3 for purposes of secondary sales of its securities, and (ii) to satisfy the requirements of Rule 144(c). 

  

 (i) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder, such Stockholders partners, members, officers, directors, and equity owners of such Stockholder Holder, 

   ##### 

  

    

any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such Stockholder, each
person, if any, who controls such Stockholder or underwriter within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and any assignee of such
Stockholder under Section 9.5 (a "Stockholder Indemnitee") from any
liability, cost, expense, claim or damage (including amounts paid in
settlement, other than amounts paid in settlement if such settlement is
effected without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) ("Damages") to which such Stockholder Indemnitee
may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other
federal or state law, insofar as such liability, cost, expense, claim or
damage (or any action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i)
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in the Stockholder Registration Statement, including any prospectus contained
therein or any amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) an omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (iii)
any violation by Parent of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state
securities law, or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, or any state securities law; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be liable for any Damages to the extent that they arise out
of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such
Stockholder expressly for use in connection with the Stockholder Registration
Statement. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.3(i) is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any Stockholder
Indemnitee in respect of any Damages referred to herein, then Parent, in lieu
of indemnifying such Stockholder Indemnitee hereunder, shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such person as a result of such Damages in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Parent, on the
one hand, and of the Stockholder Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection
with the actions or omissions that resulted in such Damages, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations.. 

  

 (j) Parent shall deliver a final form of Selling Stockholder Questionnaire (as defined below), along with reasonably detailed instructions for return, at least five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date. 

  

 (k) Upon request of any Stockholder (or any broker of such Stockholder), and submission of such forms of "seller representation letters" and "broker representation letters" as may be customary, Parent shall, at its sole cost, take such actions as may be reasonably required to cause the removal of any restrictive legends contained on the certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock comprising Closing Consideration received by such Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including providing instructions to its transfer agent and making arrangements for any opinion of counsel required by the transfer agent) in order to facilitate resales of such shares by or on behalf of such Stockholder pursuant the Stockholder Registration Statement. 

  

 (l) At any time beginning six months after the Closing Date, upon request of any Stockholder (or any broker of such Stockholder), and submission of such forms off "seller representation letters" and "broker representation letters" as may be customary, Parent shall, at its 

   ##### 

  

    

sole cost, take such actions as may be reasonably required to cause the
removal of any restrictive legends contained on the certificates evidencing
shares of Parent Common Stock comprising Closing Consideration received by
such Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including providing instructions
to its transfer agent and making arrangements for any opinion of counsel
required by the transfer agent) in order to facilitate resales of such shares
by or on behalf of such Stockholder pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
Act. 

  

 (m) After the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, upon request of any Stockholder (or any broker of such Stockholder), and submission of such forms off "seller representation letters" and "broker representation letters" as may be customary, Parent shall, at its sole cost, take such actions as may be reasonably required to cause the removal of any restrictive legends contained on the certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock comprising Closing Consideration received by such Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including providing instructions to its transfer agent and making arrangements for any opinion of counsel required by the transfer agent). 

  

 9.4 _Requirements of Stockholders_.  

  

 (a) The Stockholder Representative is authorized to (i) give and receive notices for and on behalf of the Stockholders in connection with this ARTICLE IX, and (ii) deliver, as promptly as practicable after receipt from Parent, to the Stockholders the Selling Stockholder Questionnaires (as defined in Section 9.4(b)(i) in the form provided by Parent to the Stockholder Representative, and collect completed and duly executed Selling Stockholder Questionnaires from the Stockholders. 

  

 (b) Parent shall not be required to include any shares representing Closing Consideration held by a particular Stockholder in the Stockholder Registration Statement unless:

The Selling Stockholder Questionnaire shall include an agreement by the Stockholders to indemnify Parent and each of its directors and officers against, and hold Parent and each of its directors and officers harmless from, any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) to which Parent or such directors and officers may become subject by reason of any statement or omission in the Stockholder Registration Statement made in reliance upon, or in conformity with, a written statement by such 

   ##### 

  

    

Stockholder furnished pursuant to this section, _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall such indemnification by any Stockholder exceed the net
proceeds received by such Stockholder from the sale of Closing Consideration
pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement (the "Net Proceeds"); and 

  

 (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent all completed and executed Selling Stockholder Questionnaires as received. To the extent that any Selling Stockholder Questionnaires are delivered to Parent prior to the second Business Day before the date the Stockholder Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, Parent shall include the Closing Consideration represented by such Selling Stockholder Questionnaires in the Stockholder Registration Statement. To the extent any Selling Stockholder Questionnaires are delivered to Parent after such date, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to include the Closing Consideration represented by such Selling Stockholder Questionnaires in the Stockholder Registration Statement (including by either amending the Stockholder Registration Statement or filing a supplement to the Stockholder Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event Parent shall not be obligated to file more than one (1) amendment or supplement in any 30-day period). 

  

 9.5 _Assignment of Rights_.  

  

 (a) A Stockholder may not assign any of its rights under this ARTICLE IX except in connection with the transfer (other than a sale) of some or all of such Stockholders Closing Consideration to (i) an immediate family member, a charitable trust, or to a trust for the benefit of such Stockholder or his/her immediate family member, (ii) with respect to any Stockholder that is a limited partnership, limited liability company, corporation, trust or other entity, to any constituent partner (general or limited), member, affiliate, shareholder, beneficiary or similar party, or (iii) a tax exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, provided each such transferee agrees in a written instrument delivered to Parent to be bound by the provisions of this ARTICLE IX. 

  

 9.6 _Stockholders Beneficiaries of this Article._ The Stockholders are intended third party beneficiaries of this Article IX.

This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. 

  

 11.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 11.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a

waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive
relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 11.7 _Exchange Rate_. To the extent that a warranty in ARTICLE II of this Agreement given by the Company in respect of SNAPin Software UK Limited contains reference to an amount in US$, the US$:£ exchange rate shall be US$1.9044:£1. 

  

 11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. 

  

 11.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefor, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 11.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
