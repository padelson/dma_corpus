<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;) is made and entered into as of August&nbsp;13,
2008 by and among Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), Speakeasy
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<B>Sub&nbsp;I</B>&#148;),

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub&nbsp;I and the Company believe it is in the best
interests of such company and its stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the
statutory merger of Sub&nbsp;I with and into the Company (the &#147;<B>First Step Merger</B>&#148;) and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the First Step Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;As soon as practicable following the First Step Merger, Parent shall cause the Company to

Merger, the &#147;<B>Integrated Merger</B>&#148; or the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;). The Integrated Merger is intended to constitute
a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;). Parent and the Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step
Merger will constitute integrated steps in a single &#147;plan of reorganization&#148; within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. &#167;&#167;1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization the parties adopt by executing
this Agreement.

certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the
Integrated Merger.

Property nor such Leased Real Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material
respect any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such property or
operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent on so-called non-conforming use
exceptions. The Company does not owe any brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any
Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any existing Lease Agreement were renewed
pursuant to any renewal options contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company has performed all
of its obligations under any termination agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any leases,
subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements for real property that are no longer in effect
and has no continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is reasonably likely to be required to expend more than $25,000 in
causing any Leased Real Property to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the
applicable Lease Agreement.
