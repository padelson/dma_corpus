subject to Title IV of ERISA and there is no reason to believe  the  Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation would initiate the termination of any  such 
Company Plan. Except to the extent set forth in Section 5.17(a) of  the

any of its Subsidiaries  or  ERISA Affiliates or Company Plan fiduciary
could be subject to any material  liability under the terms of such Company
Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other  applicable Law. All Company Plans that
are intended to be qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code have been
determined by the IRS to be so  qualified, or a timely application for such
determination is now pending  and to  the Company's Knowledge, there is no
reason why any such Company Plan is not so  qualified in operation. Except as
disclosed in Section 5.17(b) of the  Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company
nor any of the Company's Subsidiaries  or ERISA Affiliates has any liability
or obligation under any welfare plan  to  provide benefits after termination

time for the  assessment or payment of any Tax of or with respect to the
Company or any  of its  Subsidiaries; and

 

 

(iv) the  Company has not elected to be taxable as a corporation for federal
or state  income or franchise tax purposes and all of the Company's

to a  possible waiver of such privilege or doctrine (provided that the
Company  shall  use its commercially reasonable efforts to put in place an
arrangement to  permit  such disclosure without loss of attorney client
privilege).

 

 

SECTION  7.5. _Certain Confidential  Information_ _._

 

 

(a) Each  of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges that in connection with
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement such party and its
Affiliates  have  received and will continue to receive certain Confidential
Information (as  defined in the Confidentiality Agreement). Each of the
parties hereto  acknowledges that such party and its Affiliates are bound by
the Confidentiality  Agreement and agrees that it will not, and it will not
permit any of its  Affiliates, directors, officers, independent accountants,
agents or other  representatives to, use or disclose any Confidential
Information except as  permitted by such agreement. The provisions of this
Section 7.5 and  the Confidentiality Agreement, insofar as they relate to
Confidential  Information with respect to the businesses, operations,
properties, assets,  liabilities, financial condition and results of

their officers,  directors, employees and advisors to keep confidential, all
information relating  to the Company and the Subsidiaries, except as required
by Law and except  for  information that is available to the public on the

each case, as a result of  a  breach of this Section 7.5. The covenant set
forth in this Section  7.5(b) shall terminate two years after the Closing
Date.

return or cause to be destroyed or returned to the  other party all
documents, materials and records (including records in  electronic form)
obtained from such party or any of their Affiliates or any  other Person
acting on their behalf in connection with the transactions  contemplated
hereby, except (a) to the extent such party is advised in writing  by counsel
that such return or destruction is prohibited by Law and (b) for  any  such
documents, materials or records that may have been included in documents 
submitted to the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, of either 
party  or its Affiliates in connection with the evaluation or negotiation of
the  transactions contemplated hereby, and will continue to keep
confidential  and not  use or disclose any information not returned because
it is not included or  reflected in any documents, materials or records.

Documents; Preservation of Books and  Records_ _._

 

 

(a) For  a period of seven years from the Closing Date, (i) Purchaser shall

the books  and  records of the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to
periods prior to the  Closing (" **Books and Records** ") without first
offering to turn  over possession thereof to Seller and the Securityholders'
Representatives by  written notice to Seller and the Securityholders'
Representatives at least 90  days prior to the proposed date of such
disposition or destruction; (ii)  Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to allow Seller and  the  Securityholders' Representatives and
their agents access to and to copy all  Books and Records; and (iii)
Purchaser shall cause the Company and its  Subsidiaries to make available to
Seller and the Securityholders' Representatives upon written request (1) the

locating and  obtaining any Books and Records or other documents, and (2) any
of the Company's  and its Subsidiaries' personnel whose assistance or
participation is reasonably  required by Seller or the Securityholders'
Representatives or any of their  Affiliates in anticipation of, or
preparation for, existing or future Legal  Proceedings or other matters in
which Seller or the Securityholders' Representatives or their Affiliates are
or become involved. Any  access provided to the Seller and the
Securityholders' Representative shall be  conducted during normal business
hours and in a manner so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the conduct
of the business of the Company or the Purchaser  and  shall be at the
Seller's or the applicable Securityholder's sole cost and  expense. In
addition, the Seller and the Securityholders' Representative shall reimburse
the Company and the Purchaser for their  reasonable out of pocket expenses
for providing such access.

 

 

(b) The  seven-year period referred to in Section 7.7(a) shall be extended
if, prior  to  its termination, Seller or the Securityholders'
Representatives advise Purchaser  in writing that any Legal Proceeding or
investigation is pending or threatened  at the termination of such seven-year
period, in which case such extension  shall  continue until any such Legal
Proceeding or investigation has been settled  through judgment or otherwise
and/or is no longer pending or  threatened.

SECTION  7.9. _Employees and Employee  Benefits_ _._

 

 

(a) On  or prior to the date hereof, the Company, Seller and Purchaser have
agreed  upon  a form of joint announcement to employees concerning this
Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby and a communication plan
concerning the  method  and timing of the delivery of such announcement.
Contemporaneously  with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
parties will deliver  such  announcement to employees in accordance with
such communication  plan.

 

 

(b) On  and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be responsible with
respect to  all  employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for
compliance with  the  Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 (the " **WARN  Act** ") and any similar state or local Laws. Purchaser
shall  not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries not to,
with  respect to any site of employment or facility of any of the Company or
any  of  its Subsidiaries, at any time during the 90-day period following
the Closing  Date, take any employment action that would result in (i) a
"plant closing" (as  defined in the WARN Act), (ii) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act), or  (iii) any similar action under any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  state or local Laws requiring notice to employees in connection
with a plant  closing or layoff, in each case without complying fully with
the notice and  other requirements of the WARN Act and any similar state or
local Laws requiring  notice to employees. In addition, Purchaser hereby
agrees to  indemnify the Securityholder Indemnified Parties and to defend and
hold the  Securityholder Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any
and all  Losses  which the Securityholder Indemnified Parties may incur in
connection with  any  lawsuit, claim, arbitration, action or other
proceeding brought against the  Securityholder Indemnified Parties under the
WARN Act or any similar state  or  local Laws, which relates, in whole or in
part, to any actions taken by  Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries with regard to any site  of  employment or facility of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall assume
and agrees to honor  in  accordance with their terms all employment and
severance agreements listed  on  Section 5.17(c) of the Disclosure Schedule,
and all accrued benefits vested  thereunder, and Purchaser shall take no
action to amend, modify or terminate  such agreements.

 

 

(d) For  a period of at least one year from and after the Closing Date or for
such  longer  period as provided in any employment or severance agreement
listed on Section  5.17(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser shall
maintain, or cause the  Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain, plans for
the benefit of the employees  of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
provide benefits that are not  materially less favorable in the aggregate
(excluding benefits under incentive  compensation, bonus, stock option,
equity incentive and defined benefit pension  plans and arrangements) to such
employees than the benefits provided under  the  Company Plans immediately
prior to the Closing.

 

 

(e) With  respect to each employee benefit plan of Purchaser (" **Purchaser 
Plan** ") in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  ("
**Company Employees** ") participate after the Closing Date, for  purposes of
determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for  severance
benefits and vacation entitlement, service with the Company or  its 
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides 
past  service credit) shall be treated as service with Purchaser;
_provided,  however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent
that such  recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the
extent that  such  service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Plan. To  the extent permitted by applicable Law, Purchaser shall
cause any and all  pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar)
limitations, eligibility  waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under Purchaser  Plans  to be waived with respect to such
Company Employees and their eligible  dependents and shall provide them with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles,  and offsets (or similar payments)
made during the plan year including the  period  prior to the Closing Date
for the purposes of satisfying any applicable  deductible, out-of-pocket, or
similar requirements under any Purchaser Plans  in  which they are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) The  parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this  Section 7.9 with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of  the  respective parties hereto and shall not create any right
(i) in any other  person, including, without limitation, any employees,
former employees, any  participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary
thereof or (ii) to continued  employment with the Company or Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION  7.10. _Directors and Officers  Indemnification_ _._

 

 

(a) Purchaser  shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, for a
period of six  years  from and after the Closing Date, to keep in effect in
the Organizational  Documents of the Company and each such Subsidiary
provisions providing for  indemnification of the officers, directors,
managers, employees or agents  of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " **D andO  Indemnified Parties**") that are at least as
favorable as the provisions  of the Organizational Documents of the Company
and each such Subsidiary in  effect as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 

 

(b) This  covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by,  each  of the DandO Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and  successors. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be 
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a DandO Indemnified Party is 
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Purchaser  shall,
or shall cause the Company to, pay all expenses, including reasonable 
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party which is 
the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the indemnity 
and  other obligations provided for in this Section 7.10.

 

 

(c) If  the Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
is  not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation  or  merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties  and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary  to effectuate the purposes of this Section 7.10,
Purchaser shall cause the  Company to make proper provision so that the
successors and assigns of the  Company shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.10 and  none  of the actions described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above shall be taken until  such  provision is made.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Section 7.10, neither
Purchaser, the Company  nor any  of their respective Affiliates shall be
obligated to make any payment or  otherwise indemnify or hold harmless any
such DandO Indemnified Party who is a  Seller in the event that the Company or
such DandO Indemnified Party was aware  of such claim prior to the date hereof
but did not notify Purchaser thereof  prior to the date hereof, provided that
in any judicial, court or tribunal  proceeding relating to such claim,
whether brought or initiated by the DandO  Indemnified Party or Purchaser,
Purchaser shall have the burden of proving  that  that the Company or the
DandO Indemnified Party was aware of such claim prior  to the date hereof. The
amount of indemnification of any DandO  Indemnified Party provided under
Section 7.10 shall be net of any amounts  actually recovered by the DandO
Indemnified Party under insurance policies  with respect to such claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) To  the extent that the Company or any of is Subsidiaries would be liable
to  any  DandO Indemnified Party under any indemnification agreement and the 
allegations underlying such indemnification claim would constitute an 
indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 11.2, then the Securityholders or 
the  Seller, as the case may be, shall be liable therfor in accordance with
Section  11.2 and nothing contained herein shall reduce or compromise
Purchaser's rights  under Article XI.

 

 

SECTION  7.11. _Litigation Support and  Cooperation._ If and for so long as
any party hereto is actively  contesting or defending against any Claim or
Legal Proceeding arising in  connection with (i) the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement or  (ii)  any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,  plan,  occurrence,
event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or  prior  to the
Closing Date involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other  than 
an action brought by one party to this Agreement against another party or 
parties under the terms of this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated hereby), each of the parties will cooperate with
the contesting  or  defending party and its counsel in the contest or
defense, make available  its  personnel, and provide such testimony and
access to its books and records  (or in  the case of Purchaser, to Company's
book and records only) as shall be necessary  in connection with the contest
or defense, all at the sole cost and expense  of  the contesting or
defending party (unless the contesting or defending party  is  entitled to
indemnification therefor under Article XI) subject to and in  compliance with
any obligations of confidentiality or non-disclosure provided  by 
applicable Law or contained in any Contracts to which the Company or any  of
its  Subsidiaries is a party or by whom it is bound (provided that the
Company  shall  use its commercially reasonable efforts to put in place an
arrangement to  enable  the provision of reasonable access without violating
such obligations or  Law);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of
the parties  contained in this Section 7.11 with respect to Claims or Legal
Proceedings  of  the type described in clause (ii) above shall not apply
until after the Closing  unless any such Claims or Legal Proceedings would
reasonably be expected  to  prevent, impede or otherwise affect in any
material respect the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller  acknowledges that none of Purchaser,
the Company and their respective  Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be
obligated to provide to Seller (i) any  work  papers or similar materials
prepared by the independent public accountants  of  the Company, except to
the extent that such accountants agree to provide  access  to such work
papers or similar materials upon such terms and conditions as  shall  be
determined by such accountants in their sole discretion, and (ii) any 
documents or information that are protected by the attorney-client privilege 
or  work product doctrines if the Company determines in its reasonable
discretion  that providing copies or access to such documents or information
could give  rise  to a possible waiver of such privilege or doctrine

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as 
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and 
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation  or such transactions. The Purchaser Board of Directors shall take
all  actions, including the adoption of any resolutions, as may be necessary
or  reasonably requested by Seller, the Securityholders or the Company to
assure  that any charter and bylaw provisions in the nature of anti-takeover
provisions,  if any, are, and at the Closing Date will be, inapplicable to

described in this Section  7.16 at least 30 days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return, for  review by the Seller. The Seller shall notify
the Purchasers of any  reasonable objections the Seller may have to any items
set forth in such  draft  Tax Return and the Purchasers and the Seller agree

indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.2 must give written notice of

Party determines  that it has a basis, giving rise to such claim for
indemnification;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification  shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent  (and only to the extent) the Securityholders' Representatives
shall have been  actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such notice
must  contain a reasonably detailed description of the nature and amount of
such  Loss. If the Securityholders' Representatives do not notify the 
Purchaser Indemnified Party within thirty (30) Business Days following
receipt  of such notice that Seller disputes its liability to the Purchaser
Indemnified  Party, such claim specified by the Purchaser Indemnified Party
in such notice  shall be conclusively deemed a liability of Seller. So long
as notice  referred to in the preceding sentence is provided on or prior to
the expiration  of the survival period specified in Section 11.1, the
Purchaser Indemnified  Parties' rights to pursue recovery for the applicable
Loss shall survive until  the matter is resolved by the Purchaser Indemnified

Securityholder and  their  Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, managers, partners,  members, employees and agents (the "
**Securityholder Indemnified  Parties** ") harmless from and against any and
all Losses arising out of  (a) any breach of any representation or warranty
of Purchaser contained in  Article VI of this Agreement for which notice is
given within the survival  period specified in Section 11.1, (b) any breach
of any agreement or covenant  on  the part of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or (c) any breach of any  agreement or covenant on the part of the
Company contained in this Agreement,  but only to the extent that such
agreement or covenant is required to be  performed after Closing. The Company
and its Subsidiaries hereby release  and,  except to the extent that
indemnification by Seller or any Securityholder  is  required pursuant to
Section 11.2 above, Purchaser shall cause the Company  and  its Subsidiaries
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Securityholder  Indemnified Party
from and against any Losses or potential Losses resulting  from  such
Securityholder Indemnified Party's relationship with the Company,  including,
without limitation, those resulting from any Legal Proceeding  or  asserted
by any third party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) _Notice  of Claims_. Any Securityholder Indemnified Party making a
claim  for indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.3 must give written
notice  of  such claim to the Purchaser promptly and in any event no later
than thirty  (30)  Business Days after the Securityholder Indemnified Party
determines that  it has  a basis, giving rise to such claim for
indemnification; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect  the  indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent (and only to the  extent)  the Purchaser shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such  failure. Such notice must
contain a reasonably detailed description  of the nature and amount of such
Loss. If the Purchaser does not  notify the Securityholder Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) Business Days  following receipt of such notice that
Purchaser disputes its liability to  the  Securityholder Indemnified Party,
such claim specified by the Securityholder  Indemnified Party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability  of the  Purchaser. So long as
notice referred to in the preceding sentence is  provided on or prior to the
expiration of the survival period specified in  Section 11.1, the
Securityholder Indemnified Parties' rights to pursue  recovery for the
applicable Loss shall survive until the matter is resolved  by  the
Securityholder Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser.

 



 

SECTION  11.4. _Third Party Claims;  Procedures._ If any third party asserts
a Claim (a " **Third  Party Claim** ") against an Indemnified Party that
could reasonably be  expected to give rise to a right on the part of the
Indemnified Party to  indemnification under this Article XI, the Indemnified
Party shall give notice  of such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party
as soon as practicable  (but  in no event later than fifteen (15) Business
Days after receiving written  notice  of such Third-Party Claim or otherwise
acquiring actual knowledge of the  assertion thereof), and the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to assume  the defense of such Third-Party Claim
and may employ counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to
represent or defend against such  Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to so  notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from  any  liability that the Indemnifying Party may have
hereunder with respect to  such  Third-Party Claim, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is  prejudiced as a result of such failure,
including where the failure to so  notify  the Indemnifying Party results in
Losses to the Indemnifying Party or the  forfeiture of substantive rights or
defenses that would otherwise be available  in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party  elects not to assume the defense or
fails to assume the defense in a timely  manner, then the Indemnified Party
may employ counsel reasonably satisfactory  to  the Indemnifying Party to
represent or defend it against any such Third-Party  Claim and the
Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements  of such
counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party  shall not, in
connection with any Legal Proceeding or separate but substantially  similar
Legal Proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, be  liable 
for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at 
any  time for all Indemnified Persons, except to the extent that local
counsel,  in  addition to its regular counsel, is required in order to
effectively defend  against such Legal Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party
does assume  the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the  right  to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim at
its  expense. If the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, the 
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in providing information to 
and  consulting with the Indemnified Party about the Third-Party

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claim. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, (x) the Sellers' Representatives shall
not be entitled to assume  the defense of any Third-Party Claim (and the
Securityholders shall be liable  for the fees and expenses of counsel
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified  Party  in defending such Third-Party
Claim) if (A) the Purchaser Indemnified Party  has been advised by counsel
that there are one or more legal or equitable  defenses available and as a
result, in the opinion of such Purchaser Indemnified  Party, counsel employed
by the Sellers' Representatives could not adequately  represent the interests
of the Purchaser Indemnified Party because such  interests could be in

applicable Law (pursuant to statutory or other  provisions that cannot be
waived by the parties), from and after the Closing,  the remedies of the
parties specifically provided for by this Article XI  shall  be the sole and
exclusive post-closing monetary remedies of the parties for  all  matters
covered or contemplated by this Agreement, other than claims for  fraud  or

party  to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and the parties waive
any  and  all statutory or common law remedies they may have for such
matters, including  any right of contribution or cost recovery, whether based

SECTION  11.7. _Insurance._ The amount of  any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall  be  net of any
amounts recoverable by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect  to such
Losses under insurance policies maintained by the Company, net of  reasonable

in obtaining such recovery or proceeds. In the case  of any Third-Party
Claims for which it is reasonably likely that a party  may  have a direct or
indirect right of recovery against one or more third parties  (including, but
not limited to, rights of recovery under insurance policies  or 
indemnification arrangements with third parties), such party shall seek
recovery  of such Third-Party Claims from such third parties for so long as

party  obtains recovery in respect of any such Third-Party Claims from any
third  parties, such party shall use the funds provided by such recovery (in
lieu  of  funds provided by any other party pursuant to the indemnification
provisions  of  this Article XI) to pay or otherwise satisfy such Third-
Party Claims and  the  amount of any Losses with respect to any Third-Party
Claim for which  indemnification is available under this Article XI shall be
reduced by the  amount of such insurance proceeds or other such funds
realized or paid to  the  Indemnified Party. If, after the making of any
payment in respect of  a Third-Party Claim under this Article XI, the amount
of the Losses to which  such payment relates is reduced by recovery,
settlement or otherwise under  any  insurance coverage, or pursuant to any
claim, recovery, settlement or payment  by  or against any other Person, the
amount of such reduction will promptly be  repaid by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party. Each party  hereto shall take reasonable steps to
mitigate its Losses upon and after  becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise  to  any Losses.

 

 

SECTION  11.8. _Cooperation; Access to Documents and  Information._ The
parties shall cooperate with each other in  connection with resolving any
Claims (including, but not limited to, Third-Party  Claims) as to which
indemnification is or may be required to be provided  in  accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the  generality of the
foregoing, any Indemnified Party who desires to assert  a Claim  for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement shall (i) provide to the 
Indemnifying Party, its agent, counsel, advisors, representatives and 
consultants and all other parties involved in the defense of such Claim 
reasonable access during regular business hours to all documents and
information  reasonably

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  to such Claim which are in the possession of the Indemnified Party
or its  Affiliates or can be obtained by the Indemnified Party without undue
cost  or  expense as promptly as practicable and (ii) give the Indemnifying
Party  reasonable access to the accounting and other appropriate personnel
and the  independent accountants of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
in order  to  permit the Indemnifying Party to obtain information reasonably
required to  evaluate such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained herein, an Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay any 
Losses  arising from a Claim for so long as the Indemnified Party is in
breach in  any  material respect of its obligations in respect of such Claim
provided for  in  this Section 11.7. In addition, in no event shall an
Indemnifying  Party be liable to an Indemnified Party for any Losses arising
from a Claim  to  the extent that such Losses could reasonably be expected
to have been avoided or  reduced if the Indemnified Party had complied in a
timely manner with its  obligations under this Section 11.7.

SECTION  13.14. _Certain Rules of  Construction. _The article and section
headings and the table of  contents contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only  and  shall in no way define, limit, extend or
describe the scope or intent of  any  provisions of this Agreement. Whenever
the context may require, any  pronoun used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine,  feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns, pronouns and verbs  shall include the plural and vice versa. In
addition, as used in this  Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the
contrary, (a) all references to  days, months or years shall be deemed
references to calendar days, months  or  years or (b) any reference to a
"Section," "Article" or "Exhibit" shall be  deemed to refer to a section or
article of this Agreement, a Disclosure Schedule  or an exhibit attached to
this Agreement. Unless the context  otherwise requires, the words "hereof,"
"herein," and "hereunder" and words of  similar import referring to this
Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole  and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes," "including" or
"such as" shall be deemed to be followed  by the words "without limitation."
The word "will" shall be construed  to have the same meaning and effect as
the word "shall." The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean
the degree to which a subject  or other thing extends, and such phrase shall
not mean simply "if". The phrase "date hereof" or "date of this Agreement"
shall be  deemed to refer to July 22, 2007. Unless otherwise specifically 
provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be  exclusive. This
Agreement shall be construed without regard to any  presumption or rule
requiring construction or interpretation against the  party  drafting or
causing any instrument to be drafted. Unless a contrary  intent is apparent,
any Contract, instrument or Law defined or referred to  herein or in any
Contract or instrument that is referred to herein means  such  Contract,
instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or  supplemented,
including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver  or  consent
and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable successor Law  and 
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated  therein.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors  and permitted
assigns.

 

 

SECTION  13.15. _Counterparts. _This  Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be  deemed an original, which may be
delivered in person, by facsimile or by  electronic image scan, and all of
which taken together shall constitute one  instrument binding on all the
parties, notwithstanding that all the parties  are  not signatories to the
original or the same counterpart.

Shares may, in  certain instances, be referred to separately in this
Agreement) and  the stock  certificates representing the Escrow Shares and
Additional Escrow  Shares, when  appropriate.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(iii) The  term "Escrow Period" is defined as that time period beginning at

that the total value of  such Escrow Shares so deposited shall equal 110% of
the Initial Escrow  Value.

 



 

(c) _Delivery  of Stock Powers_. Promptly after the Closing Date, but in
any  event within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, each 
Securityholder  set forth on _Exhibit A_ will deliver to the Escrow Agent at
least four  duly endorsed stock power (a " _Stock Power_ ") substantially in
the form  attached as _Exhibit B_.

 



 

(d) _Legends_. Stock  certificates representing Escrow Shares will (until
they are released  in  accordance with this Agreement) bear the following
legend indicating  that they  are subject to this Agreement:

 



 

"THE  SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED,  PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN
ESCROW  AGREEMENT  AMONG THE ISSUER, THE HOLDER THEREOF AND JPMORGAN CHASE
BANK, NA. A  COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF
THE  ISSUER."

 



 

(e) _Cash  Escrow Amount_.

 



 

(i) _Cash  Escrow Amount Generally_. Each Securityholder may, in its sole 
discretion at any time, by causing the Securityholders' Representatives to 
deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent with the amount  and number
of  Escrow Shares to be exchanged, replace all (but not less than all)  of
the Escrow  Shares in such Securityholder's account with cash in an amount
equal to (a) such  Securityholder's pro rata portion of the Initial Escrow
Value, minus (b) the  cash value of all Claims settled from such
Securityholder's account as of such  date (each referred to herein as a "
_Cash Escrow_ "). The Escrow  Agent will not be responsible for determining
the amount of Cash  Escrow to be  deposited into the account.

 



 

(ii) _Release  of Escrow Shares upon Receipt of Cash Escrow Amount_. Within 
seven (7) Business Days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of such  Cash
Escrow  amount from a Securityholder, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the

_____________________  

 

 

1  The Escrow Period will be 12 months and 1 day.

address  set forth opposite such Securityholder's name on the Escrow Ledger
(or such  other address as provided in writing by the Securityholders'
Representatives to  the Escrow Agent).

 



 

(iii) _Investment  of Cash Escrow_ **. **Until the Release Date, a 
Securityholder's Cash Escrow, if any has been deposited with the Escrow
Agent  pursuant to clause (i) above, shall be invested and reinvested by 
the Escrow  Agent at the joint written direction of Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Representatives, in the name of the Escrow Agent or its
nominee,  in (i)  readily-marketable direct obligations of, or repurchase
agreements  collateralized by direct obligations of, the United States
Government  or backed  by the full faith and credit of the United States
Government, (ii)  certificates  of deposit, time deposits, money market
accounts, or other interest  bearing  deposits of commercial banks with a
maturity not more than five (5)  days after  purchase or (iii) any other
investments agreed to by the Securityholders' Representatives and the
Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled  to sell or redeem any such
investment as necessary to make any distributions  required under this
Agreement and shall not be liable or responsible  for any  loss resulting
from any such sale or redemption.

 



 

Subject  to principles of best  execution, transactions shall be effected on
behalf of the Cash Escrow  through  broker-dealers selected by JPMorgan
Asset Management ("JPMAM"). In  this regard, JPMAM seeks to attain the best
overall result for the  Cash Escrow,  taking into consideration quality of
service and reliability. An  agency fee will be assessed in connection with
each transaction.  The Escrow  Agent shall have the right to liquidate any
investments held in order  to provide  funds necessary to make required
payments under this Agreement. The  Escrow Agent shall have no liability for
any loss sustained as a  result of any  investment in an investment made
pursuant to the terms of this contract  or as a  result of any liquidation
of any investment prior to its maturity  or for the  failure of the parties
to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest  or  reinvest the Cash
Escrow. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates  may receive compensation
with respect to any investment directed  hereunder. Receipt, investment and
reinvestment of the Cash Escrow  shall be confirmed by Escrow Agent as soon
as practicable by account  statement,  and any discrepancies in any such
account statement shall be noted  by parties to  Escrow Agent within 30
calendar days after receipt thereof. Failure  to inform Escrow Agent in
writing of any discrepancies in any such  account  statement within said
30-day period shall conclusively be deemed  confirmation of  such account
statement in its entirety.

 



 

1.2 _Indemnification_. Purchaser  and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are
entitled to be indemnified  by the  Securityholders pursuant to the terms of
Article 11 of the Unit Purchase  Agreement against certain Losses during the
Escrow Period. All claims  for Losses under Article 11 of the Unit Purchase
Agreement must be  initiated  prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period,
unless otherwise specified  in the  Unit Purchase Agreement. Each of the
Securityholders has agreed to  the use of the Escrow Shares or such
Securityholder's Cash Escrow, if any, as  applicable, as collateral for these
indemnity obligations, subject  to the terms  and limitations set forth in
Article 11 of the Unit Purchase Agreement  and in  this Agreement.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

**ARTICLE  II.**

 

**OWNERSHIP  INTERESTS IN ESCROW SHARES AND**

 

**RELEASE  OF THE ESCROW PROPERTY**

 



 

2.1 _Securityholders '  Interests in the Escrow Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Individual  Securityholder 's Interests_. The Escrow Shares shall be
evidenced  by certificates issued in the name of each Securityholder as
shown  in _Exhibit  A_. All of the Escrow Shares shall be deemed to be
issued and  outstanding capital stock of the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) _Dividends_. If  the Purchaser declares any cash dividends, dividends
payable in other  property  or other distributions of any kind with respect
to Escrow Shares  held by the  Escrow Agent, Purchaser will issue such
distributions directly to  the  Securityholders; _provided_ , that stock
dividends that are issued in  order to effect a stock split of Purchaser's
Common Stock on Escrow Shares  declared during the Escrow Period ("
_Additional Escrow Shares_ ") will be  delivered promptly to the Escrow
Agent, held in escrow and distributed  to the  Securityholders in the same
manner and in the same proportions as  the Escrow  Shares. For all purposes
of this Agreement, the Additional Escrow  Shares will be treated the same as
the Escrow Shares. Unless and  until the Escrow Agent receives certificates
representing Additional  Escrow  Shares, it may assume without inquiry that
no Additional Escrow Shares  have  been, or are required to be, issued and
that the stock certificates  that the  Escrow Agent possesses represent all
of the Escrow Shares.

 



 

(c) _Voting  and Other Rights of Ownership_. While the Escrow Shares remain
in the  possession of the Escrow Agent, each Securityholder beneficially 
owning Escrow  Shares will retain and will be able to exercise with respect
to such  Escrow  Shares: (i) voting rights, and (ii) all other incidents of
ownership  of such  Escrow Shares which are not inconsistent with the terms
of this Agreement,  including the right to cause the tender of such Escrow
Shares in  a tender offer  for Purchaser Common Stock. The Purchaser, not
the Escrow Agent,  will be  responsible for furnishing any proxy forms or
other information generally  distributed by Purchaser to its stockholders.

 



 

(d) _No  Transfers or Encumbrances_. Prior to the release of the Escrow 
Shares by the Escrow Agent and delivery to each Securityholder pursuant  to 
Section 2.3, Securityholders may not sell, assign or otherwise transfer, 
nor  place any Encumbrance on, any Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest 
therein,  except: (i)to limited partners or members of such
Securityholders;  (ii)  transfers by operation of law; and (iii) in
connection with a tender  offer for  Purchaser Common Stock; _provided_ ,
that in the case of any such  permitted transfer, the transferee shall have
agreed to be subject  to all terms  and provisions of this Agreement. Also,
prior to the release of the  Escrow Shares by the Escrow Agent and delivery
to each Securityholder  pursuant  to Section 2.3, no Escrow Shares nor any
beneficial interest therein  will be  taken or reached by any legal or
equitable process in satisfaction  of any debt  or other liability of a
Securityholder, except to satisfy such Securityholder's  obligations under
Article 11 of the Unit Purchase Agreement. The  Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for determining or

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

enforcing  compliance with this paragraph, other than by retaining
possession  of the Escrow  Shares.

 



 

(e) _Individual  Securityholder Liability_. The maximum liability for any
Losses  under Section 11.2 of the Unit Purchase Agreement is set forth in 
Section 11.5  of the Unit Purchase Agreement. Payments for finally
determined  Claims (defined in Section 3.1) (i) that result from breaches
of  the Company or  the Seller shall be deducted from the Escrow Shares or
Cash Escrow  of each  Securityholder pro rata in proportion to each
Securityholder's respective  percentage interest in the Escrow Shares as
shown on _Exhibit A_ hereto and  (ii) that result from breaches of a
particular Securityholder shall  be deducted  solely from such
Securityholder's Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow.

 



 

2.2 _Escrow  Ledger_.

 



 

(a) _Required  Information_. The Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Representatives shall create and maintain a written
record,  in substantially the  form attached as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Escrow
Ledger_ ") of: (1) each  Securityholder's name and address and wire transfer
instructions; (2) each  Securityholder's interest in the Escrow Shares by
number of shares; (3) the  dollar amount of each Securityholder's pro rata
portion of the Initial Escrow  Value; (4) each Securityholder's amount of
Cash Escrow, if any; (5) each  Securityholder's interest in other assets held
in escrow; (6) each  Securityholder's percentage interest in the total Escrow
Shares (which shall  remain fixed); (7) each Securityholder's interest in
Escrow Shares or such  Securityholder's Cash Escrow subject to pending
Contested Claims (defined in  Section 4.3); and (8) Escrow Shares or such
Securityholder's Cash Escrow to be  released to each Securityholder on the
Release Date. The Escrow  Ledger shall also reflect the total number of
Escrow Shares remaining  in  escrow.

 



 

(b) _Adjustments  to the Ledger_. The Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Representatives shall adjust the Escrow Ledger to reflect
changes  in each  Securityholder's interests in the Escrow Shares or such
Securityholder's Cash  Escrow. This duty shall continue until the Escrow
Agent is required  to deliver each Securityholder's Escrow Shares or Cash
Escrow pursuant to  Section 2.3. Absent manifest error, all of the
Purchaser's and the  Securityholders' Representatives' determinations as to
the Escrow Ledger shall  be binding and conclusive on all parties to this 
Agreement. Adjustments to the Ledger shall include, but are not  limited to,
the following:

 



 

(i) _Adjustments  for Capital Changes_. The Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Representatives shall adjust the Escrow Ledger to reflect
the  issuance of  Additional Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

 



 

(ii) _Adjustments  for Claims_. The Escrow Agent shall deduct Escrow Shares
or Cash Escrow  amounts that become subject to pending Contested Claims of
the Purchaser  or  Purchaser Indemnified Parties from column 8 of each
Securityholder's account and  add such Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow amounts
to column 7 of each  Securityholder's account. The Escrow Agent shall deduct
Escrow Shares or Cash  Escrow amounts that are charged and allocated to each
Securityholder's account  pursuant to Article 4 in satisfaction of Claims by
the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Purchaser  or Purchaser Indemnified Parties from columns 2-8, as 
appropriate. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible for determining  the
number of Escrow Shares or amount of Cash Escrow to be  released. Purchaser
and the Securityholders' Representatives will be  responsible for calculating
the number of Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow  to be  released by delivering
written instructions to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

2.3 _Release  of Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow Amounts to Securityholders_.

 



 

(a) _Release  of Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow_ _Amounts _ _Generally_. On [
], 2008, (the "Release  Date"), in accordance with Section 2.3(c), the
Purchaser and the  Securityholders' Representatives shall certify the Escrow
Share and Cash Escrow  balances reflected in the Escrow Ledger as of that
date and shall  deliver  written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release
the appropriate  number of  Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow amount to each
Securityholder as designated  in  column 8 of the Escrow Ledger, which shall
equal such Securityholder's original  Escrow Shares and Additional Escrow
Shares or the amount of Cash  Escrow, minus:  (i) any Escrow Shares or Cash
Escrow amounts attributable to such  Securityholder  that were returned to
the Purchaser in accordance with Article 4  in satisfaction  of a Claim(s)
by the Purchaser or Purchaser Indemnified Parties,  and (ii) any  Escrow
Shares or Cash Escrow amounts attributable to such Securityholder  that  are
subject to pending Claims of the Purchaser or other Purchaser  Indemnified 
Parties, to be held pursuant to Section 2.3(b).

 



 

(b) _Escrow  Shares and Cash Escrow_ _Amounts_ _Subject to Pending  Claims_.

 



 

(i) After  the Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold any
Escrow  Shares or  Cash Escrow amounts that are subject to pending Claims
until the  thirty (30) day  period in Section 4.2 expires. At that time, the
Escrow Agent shall,  as appropriate, either return the Escrow Shares or Cash
Escrow amounts  subject  to such claim pursuant to Section 4.2, or continue
to hold the Escrow  Shares or  Cash Escrow amounts subject to such Claim
pursuant to Section  2.3(b)(ii).

 



 

(ii) After  the Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold any
Escrow  Shares or  Cash Escrow amounts that are subject to Contested Claims
of the Purchaser  or  other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as designated in
column 7 of  the Escrow  Ledger, until the Escrow Agent receives written
notice of resolution  of each  specific Claim pursuant to Section 4.4 signed
by Purchaser and Securityholders' Representatives. After the Escrow Agent
receives such written notice,  in accordance with Section 2.3(c), the Escrow
Agent shall: (a) either  deliver to  each Securityholder its remaining Cash
Escrow or the number of Escrow  Shares, if  any, due to each Securityholder
in accordance with the resolution  of the Claim  and (b) if applicable,
charge and allocate Escrow Shares or amounts  against the  applicable
Securityholder's Cash Escrow in satisfaction of the resolution of the  Claim
and return such Escrow Shares or its remaining Cash Escrow  subject to such 
Claim to the Purchaser The Purchaser and the Securityholders'
Representatives  shall make the appropriate entries in the Escrow Ledger.

 



 

(c) _Procedure  for Release and Delivery_. Within seven (7) Business Days
after  the Release Date (or within seven (7) Business Days after the Escrow 
Agent's  receipt of

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

written  notice of a resolution of a Claim pursuant to Section 4.4), the
Escrow  Agent  shall deliver the Escrow Shares or the Cash Escrow amounts to
the  applicable  Securityholder by mailing (by registered or certified mail,
return  receipt  requested) by express courier to the address set forth
opposite such  Securityholder's name on the Escrow Ledger (or such other
address as provided in  writing by the Securityholders' Representatives to
the Escrow Agent) or by wire  transfer to the account set forth opposite such
Securityholder's name on the  Escrow Ledger. No fractional Escrow Shares will
be delivered;  instead, the Purchaser will pay cash in lieu of any fractions
of  Escrow Shares  in an amount equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by  the value of an  Escrow Share as determined in accordance
with Section 4.5. The  Purchaser and the Securityholders' Representatives
will determine the amounts of  such cash payments in lieu of fractional
shares to be made

 



 

**ARTICLE  III.**

 

**CLAIMS**

 



 

3.1 _" Claim"  Defined_. As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for 
indemnification under Article 11 of the Unit Purchase Agreement made  by
the  Purchaser or by any other Purchaser Indemnified Party. The Purchaser 
agrees that it will make Claims only as permitted by Article 11 of  the
Unit  Purchase Agreement. For  the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Agent
shall have no liability  with respect to  any provisions of this Agreement
which set forth obligations or limitations  of  liability that the other
parties to this Agreement have to each other,  without  regard to any action
to be taken by or refrained from by the Escrow  Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
have no obligation to investigate,  inquire, examine or assist in any manner
whatsoever, the parties\'  compliance  with the terms of this Agreement that
incorporate by reference provisions  of the  Unit Purchase Agreement that
apply to the other parties\' obligations  or  limitations of liability to
each other that do not relate to obligations  of the  Escrow Agent under
this Agreement.

 



 

3.2 _Notice  of Claim_.

 



 

(a) _When  a Notice of Claim is Required_. Purchaser shall execute and 
deliver written notice of a Claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the 
Securityholders' Representatives and the Escrow Agent as promptly as
reasonably  practicable, and in no event after the Escrow Period, upon:

 



 

(i) The  Purchaser's discovery of any breach of or default in connection with
any of  the  provisions of the Unit Purchase Agreement that are
indemnifiable  under Section  11.2 of the Unit Purchase Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) The  Purchaser's receipt of written notice of an order or proceeding
brought by  any  third Person against the Purchaser and/or any Purchaser
Indemnified  Parties that  is based upon or includes assertions that would,
if true, constitute  an  inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of or default
in connection  with any of  the provisions of the Unit Purchase Agreement
that are indemnifiable  under  Section 11.2 of the Unit Purchase Agreement,
(a " _Third Party  Proceeding_ ");

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) _Failure  to Provide Notice of Claim_. Failure to provide such notice in
a  timely manner shall not reduce Purchaser's indemnification rights or the 
indemnification obligations of the Securityholders in this Agreement  and
under  the Unit Purchase Agreement, unless the failure to provide such
notice  materially impairs the indemnifying party's ability to defend the
Claim, and  then only to the extent of such impairment.

 



 

3.3 _Contents  of Each Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by the 
Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.2 shall be set forth in writing and  shall 
contain the following information to the extent it is reasonably  available
to  the Purchaser:

 



 

(a) _Statement  of Damages_. The statement of damages shall include: (i)
the  amount of Losses that the Purchaser believes has actually been
incurred  by the  Purchaser and/or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party in
connection  with the  Claim and (ii) the Purchaser's good faith estimate of
the reasonably foreseeable  maximum amount of the alleged Losses that will
ultimately be incurred  by the  Purchaser and/or any other Purchaser
Indemnified Party in connection  with such  Claim, including without
limitation any Losses from a potential Third  Party  Proceeding.

 



 

(b) _Statement  of Basis for Damages_. The statement of basis for damages
shall  include a brief description, in reasonable detail, of the facts, 
circumstances  or events giving rise to the alleged Losses based on the
Purchaser's or any  other affected Purchaser Indemnified Parties, good faith
belief.

 



 

3.4 _Requirement  of Resolution of Claims_. The Escrow Agent shall not act
regarding  any of the Escrow Shares or the Cash Escrow held pursuant to a
Notice  of Claim  until such Notice of Claim has been resolved in accordance
with Article  4 and,  in the case of a Contested Claim, it receives
appropriate notice  pursuant to  Section 4.4.

 



 

**ARTICLE  IV.**

 

**RESOLUTION  OF CLAIMS**

 



 

Any  Notice of Claim received by the  Securityholders' Representatives and
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Article 3  shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Third  Party Proceedings_. Third party proceedings shall be handled in 
the manners set forth in Section 11.4 of the Unit Purchase  Agreement.

 



 

4.2 _Uncontested  Claims_. If, prior to 5:00 p.m Central Time on the
thirtieth  (30th) calendar day after the Escrow Agent receives a Notice of
Claim,  the  Securityholders' Representatives do not contest such Notice of
Claim (an " _Uncontested Claim_ ") in a written notice delivered to the
Escrow Agent  pursuant to Section 4.3, then the Escrow Agent shall upon
written instructions  from Purchaser immediately charge and allocate against
each Securityholder's  accounts in the Escrow Ledger the number of Escrow
Shares or portion  of such  Securityholder's Cash Escrow required, pursuant
to Section 4.5, to satisfy the  amount of Losses specified in such Notice of
Claim (reduced by any  recovery to  date under policies of insurance not
reflected in the Notice of  Claim). Additionally, the Purchaser and the 
Securityholders'

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Representatives  shall provide the Escrow Agent with an updated Escrow Ledger
to reflect  the  effect of the deduction pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii). The
number of  Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow amounts deducted hereunder shall be 
charged to and  allocated (i) among the Securityholders pro rata according to
each  Securityholder's percentage share, as set forth in columns 4 or 6 of
the Escrow  Ledger, as applicable, with respect to Losses relating to
breaches  of the Unit  Purchase Agreement by the Seller or the Company, and
(ii) to the  applicable  Securityholder with respect to Losses relating to
breaches of the  Unit Purchase  Agreement by such Securityholder. For the
avoidance of doubt,  Purchaser and the Securityholders' Representatives will
be responsible for  calculating the number of Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow to
be released  by  delivering written instructions to Escrow Agent.

 



 

4.3 _Contested  Claims_. If the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent receive a
written  notice contesting all, or a portion of, a Notice of Claim within 
the thirty (30)  day period described in Section 4.2 (a " _Contested Claim_
"), then Purchaser  and Securityholders' Representatives will work together
in good faith to resolve  their dispute for up to thirty (30) days. If the
Contested Claim is  still not resolved, then: (a) such Contested Claim shall
be resolved  pursuant to  the terms of the Unit Purchase Agreement, and (b)
the Escrow Agent  shall  continue to hold the number of Escrow Shares or
Cash Escrow amounts  sufficient,  pursuant to Section 4.5, to satisfy the
maximum potential award to  all Purchaser  Indemnified Parties under such
Claim.

 



 

4.4 _Settled  Claims_. If a Claim (including a Contested Claim) is settled by
a  written settlement agreement executed by the Securityholders'
Representatives  and the Purchaser, then the Securityholders' Representatives
and the Purchaser  shall promptly deliver such written settlement agreement
to the Escrow  Agent  with written instructions on the appropriate charges
or adjustments  to be made  to the Escrow Ledger, and the Escrow Agent shall
promptly release  and/or return  the Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow amounts
subject to such claim in  accordance  with Sections 2.3(b) and 2.3(c).

 



 

4.5 _Determination  of Number of Escrow Shares for Claims_.

 



 

(a) Unless  a specific number of Escrow Shares is specified, any amount
owed  to the  Purchaser under this Agreement will be immediately payable to
the  Purchaser,  subject to Section 4.3, by deducting from the Escrow
Shares, the  number of  Escrow Shares equal to: (a) the asserted Losses for
such Claim, divided  by, (b)  the Claim Set-Aside Amount. Such deductions
shall be allocated (i)  among the Securityholders pro rata according to each
Securityholder's percentage  share, as set forth in column 6 of the Escrow
Ledger with respect  to Losses  relating to breaches of the Unit Purchase
Agreement by the Seller  or the  Company, and (ii) to the applicable
Securityholder with respect to  Losses  relating to breaches of the Unit
Purchase Agreement by such  Securityholder. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Claim Set-Aside  Amount" shall mean for each share of Purchaser Common
Stock, a value equal  to  the weighted average trading price for a share of
Purchaser Common  Stock for the  twenty (20) trading days preceding the date
that the Notice of Claim  is  delivered to the Securityholders'
Representatives or the Escrow  Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
and the Securityholders' Representatives will be responsible for calculating
the number of  Escrow Shares  or Cash Escrow to be released by delivering
written instructions  to the Escrow  Agent.

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) The  Escrow Shares shall be revalued as of the date on which payment
for  a finally  determined Claim is to be made, and the actual number of
Escrow Shares  to be  paid to the Purchaser to settle the Claim shall be
determined by  dividing (a)  the asserted Losses for such Claim by, (b) the
Valuation Price. The  number of Escrow Shares deducted from each
Securityholder's account pursuant to  clause (a) above shall be increased or
decreased, as necessary, and  the Escrow  Ledger shall be modified
accordingly. For purposes of this Agreement, "Valuation Price" shall mean for
each share of Purchaser Common Stock, a value  equal to the weighted average
trading price for a share of Purchaser  Common  Stock for the twenty (20)
trading days preceding the date on which  such Claim is  satisfied. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and the  Securityholders' Representatives will
be responsible for calculating the number  of Escrow Shares or Cash Escrow to
be released by delivering written  instructions to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

**ARTICLE  V.**

 

**THE  ESCROW AGENT**

 



 

5.1 _Limitation  of Escrow Agent 's Liability/Responsibility_. The Escrow
Agent shall incur no  liability with respect to any action taken or suffered
by it in reliance  upon  any notice, direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other document  believed by it to be genuine and duly
authorized, nor for any other  action or  inaction, except its own willful
misconduct, fraud or gross negligence.  The  Escrow Agent shall have no duty
or responsibility: (a) for the validity  or  sufficiency of this Agreement,
nor to inquire into or investigate  the validity,  accuracy or content of
any document that it receives, (b) to verify  that the  Securityholders'
Representatives or the Purchaser received a Notice of Claim or  other
required notice, and (c) other than those expressly set forth  in this 
Agreement and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. The  Escrow
Agent  will not be required to take any action hereunder involving any
expense  unless  the payment of such expense is made or provided for in a
manner satisfactory  to  it. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
impose upon the  Escrow Agent any duty to qualify to do business or to act as
a fiduciary  or  otherwise in any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas
No party  to this  Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to,
or if it  is unable to  perform its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement because  of, acts of  God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes,
electrical outages, equipment  or  transmission failure, or other causes
reasonably beyond its  control.

 



 

5.2 _Use  of Agents and Reliance on Counsel_. The Escrow Agent may execute 
any of its powers or responsibilities hereunder and exercise any  rights 
hereunder either directly or through its agents or attorneys and  shall be 
entitled to consult with its legal counsel, including in-house legal 
counsel, as  to any questions or matters arising hereunder. The reasonable,
good  faith written opinion of such legal counsel shall be full and
complete  authorization and protection to the Escrow Agent in respect of
any  act or  omission by the Escrow Agent undertaken in good faith and in
accordance  with the  opinion of such legal counsel. The Escrow Agent shall
have no  liability for the conduct of any outside attorneys, accountants or 
other similar  professionals it retains.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

5.3 _Indemnification  of the Escrow Agent_.

 

 

 

(a) For  the purposes of this Section 5.3, references to the Escrow Agent 
shall include  the Escrow Agent's officers, directors, employees, counsel
and  agents.

 



 

(b) The  Parties (each an " _Indemnifying Party_ " and together the "
_Indemnifying  Parties_ ") will reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the
Escrow Agent  from  and against any damage, liability or loss suffered,
incurred by,  or asserted  against the Escrow Agent (including amounts paid
in settlement of  any action,  suit, proceeding, or claim brought or
threatened to be brought and  including  reasonable expenses of legal
counsel, collectively, " _Loss_ ") arising out  of, in connection with or
based upon any act or omission by the Escrow  Agent  relating in any way to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agent's services hereunder;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and the Securityholders (each  on a pro rata basis
based on their respective interest in the Initial  Escrow  Value), on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall  each be  severally liable
for 50% of any Loss. This indemnity will exclude any  indemnification for any
Loss arising in whole or in part, directly  or  indirectly, from any gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the  Escrow  Agent's part. Anything in
this Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding, in no event will the Escrow
Agent be liable for  special,  indirect or consequential loss or damage of
any kind whatsoever (including  but  not limited to lost profits) suffered
by another party to this Agreement,  even  if the Escrow Agent has been
advised of the likelihood of such loss  or damage  and regardless of the
form of action. The Parties hereby grant the  Escrow Agent  a lien on, right
of set-off against and security interest in the  Escrow Property  for the
payment of any claim for indemnification, compensation, expenses  and 
amounts due hereunder.

 



 

(c) Each  Indemnifying Party may participate at its own expense in the
defense  of any  claim or action that may be asserted against the Escrow
Agent related  to this  Agreement, and if the Indemnifying Parties so elect,
the Indemnifying  Parties  may assume the defense of such claim or action;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if there exists a conflict of interest  that
would make  it inappropriate, in the sole discretion of the Escrow Agent,
for  the same  counsel to represent both Escrow Agent and the Indemnifying
Parties,  the Escrow  Agent's retention of separate counsel will be
reimbursable as herein above  provided. The Escrow Agent's right to
indemnification hereunder will survive the  Escrow Agent's resignation or
removal as the Escrow Agent and will survive the  termination of this
Agreement by lapse of time or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The  Escrow Agent will notify each Indemnifying Party by letter, or by 
telephone or  telecopy confirmed by letter, of any receipt by Escrow Agent of
a  written  assertion of a claim against the Escrow Agent arising out of
this  Agreement, or  any action commenced against the Escrow Agent arising
out of this  Agreement,  within five (5) Business Days after the Escrow
Agent's receipt of written notice  of such claim. However, the Escrow Agent's
failure to so notify each  Indemnifying Party will not operate in any manner
whatsoever to relieve  an  Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to the Escrow  Agent under  this Section 5.3 or otherwise unless such
failure by the Escrow Agent  to give  such notice materially prejudices such
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

5.4 _Compensation  and Expenses of Escrow Agent_. Purchaser and the
Securityholders  agree to (i) pay the Escrow Agent upon execution of this
Agreement  and from time  to time

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

thereafter  reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered
hereunder,  which unless  otherwise agreed in writing shall be as described
in _Exhibit D_ attached  hereto, and pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent upon
request for all  expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable
attorney\'s  fees and  expenses, incurred or made by it in connection with
the preparation,  execution,  performance, delivery, modification and
termination of this  Agreement. Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the 
Securityholders, on the other hand, will be responsible for paying  50% of
the  Escrow Agent fees upfront up to the Release Date upon signing this 
Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _Resolution  of Conflicting Demands_. In the event conflicting demands
are made  or conflicting notices are served upon the Escrow Agent with
respect  to the  Escrow Shares, any of the Cash Escrow or the Escrow Ledger,
the Escrow  Agent  shall have the right, at the Escrow Agent's election, to
either: (a) give  written notice to the other parties to this Agreement that
it has  received  conflicting instructions from the Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Representatives and is refraining from taking action until
it receives  instructions consented to in writing by both the Purchaser and
the  Securityholders' Representatives, or (b) resign so that a successor
escrow agent  can be appointed pursuant to Section 5.6. In the further event
that  the Escrow Agent gives written notice under "(a)" above and does not
receive  instructions consented to in writing by both the Purchaser and the 
Securityholders' Representatives within thirty (30) calendar days, then the 
Escrow Agent may file a suit in interpleader and obtain an order  from a
court of  competent jurisdiction located in Houston, Texas requiring the
parties  to  interplead and litigate in such court their several claims and
rights  among  themselves. In this case, the Escrow Agent shall thereby be
fully  released and discharged from all further obligations imposed upon  it
under this  Agreement with respect to the matters that are the subject of
such  interpleader  suit, and the Purchaser and the Securityholders shall
pay the Escrow  Agent all  costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees
expended or incurred by the  Escrow Agent pursuant to the exercise of Escrow
Agent's rights under this  paragraph.

 



 

5.6 _Successor  Escrow Agent_.

 



 

(a) In  the event the Escrow Agent becomes unavailable or unwilling to
continue  in its  capacity as Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow Agent may
resign and  be  discharged from its duties hereunder by giving notice of
resignation  to the  parties to this Agreement, specifying a date not less
than ten (10)  days  following such notice date of when such resignation
shall take effect  and  refunding to the Purchaser and the Securityholders
any prepaid but  unearned fees  previously paid by the Purchaser and the
Securityholders to the Escrow  Agent  hereunder. The Purchaser shall
designate a successor Escrow Agent  reasonably satisfactory to the
Securityholders' Representatives prior to the  expiration of such ten (10)
day period by giving written notice to  the Escrow  Agent and the
Securityholders' Representatives. If no successor  escrow agent is named by
the Purchaser, then the Escrow Agent may  apply to a  court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor  Escrow Agent.  In either
case, the Escrow Agent shall promptly transfer the Escrow  Shares and 
Escrow Ledger to the designated successor Escrow Agent.

 



 

(b) In  the event Escrow Agent is merged with, acquired or otherwise
combined  with  another entity, or Escrow Agent transfers all or
substantially all  of its  corporate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

trust  business (including the escrow contemplated by this Agreement) to 
another  institution, the successor as a result of such transaction will be 
the Escrow  Agent hereunder without any further action by the parties hereto.

 



 

**ARTICLE  VI.**

 

**THE  SECURITYHOLDERS ' REPRESENTATIVES**

 



 

The  rights and obligations of the  Securityholders' Representatives shall
be as set forth in Article III of the  Unit Purchase Agreement.

Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and  agreement
of  the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement  and
supersedes  all prior agreements or understandings, written or oral,
between  the parties  with respect to the subject matter hereof. As between
the Escrow  Agent and the other parties hereto, all such parties agree that
the  Escrow  Agent's duties are defined only in this Agreement.

 



 

7.2 _Assignment;  Binding Nature_. No party to this Agreement may assign 
all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder without the prior 
written  consent of the Escrow Agent and the other parties hereto. Except
for  assignments in connection with permitted transfers of Escrow Shares 
under  Section 2.1(d) of this Agreement, the Securityholders may not assign 
any of  their rights or obligations hereunder, nor may rights or
obligations  be assigned  by operation of law, without the prior written
consent of the  Purchaser. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to
the  benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and 
permitted  assigns.

 



 

7.3 _Construction  of Agreement_. This Agreement has been negotiated by the 
respective parties hereto and their attorneys and has been reviewed  by
each  party hereto. Accordingly, no ambiguity in the language of this 
Agreement will be construed for or against either party.

 



 

7.4 _Section  Headings_. A reference to a section, article or exhibit will
mean  a section in, article in or exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise  explicitly set forth. The titles and headings herein are for 
reference purposes only and will not in any manner limit the construction 
of  this Agreement, which will be considered as a whole.

 



 

7.5 _Amendment_. This  Agreement may be amended by the written agreement of
Purchaser, the  Escrow Agent  and the Securityholders' Representatives;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that, if the Escrow Agent does not agree to an
amendment agreed upon  by the  Purchaser and the Securityholders'
Representatives, then the Escrow Agent shall  resign and the Purchaser shall
appoint a successor Escrow Agent in  accordance  with the provisions of
Section 5.6. No amendment of the Unit Purchase  Agreement shall increase or
alter the Escrow Agent's duties, responsibilities or  liability hereunder
without the Escrow Agent's written agreement.

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

7.6 _Waiver_. No  waiver by any party hereto of any condition or of any
breach of any  provision of  this Agreement shall be effective unless it is
set forth in a writing  signed by  such party. No waiver by any party of any
such condition or breach,  in any one instance, shall be deemed to be a
further or continuing  waiver of any  such condition or breach or a waiver
of any other condition or breach  of any  other provision contained herein.
The failure of any party to enforce  any of the provisions hereof will not be
construed to be a waiver  of the right  of such party thereafter to enforce
such provisions.

 



 

7.7 _Severability_. If  any provision of this Agreement or its application
will for any reason  and to  any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement  and  application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will  be  interpreted so as to effect the intent of
the parties hereto. The  parties will replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this  Agreement with  a valid and enforceable provision that
will achieve, to the extent  possible, the  economic, business and other
purposes of the void or unenforceable  provision.

 



 

7.8 _Governing  Law_. The validity of this Agreement the construction of
its  terms, and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties 
of the  parties of this Agreement will be exclusively governed by and
construed  in  accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
as applied  to  agreements entered into solely between residents of and to
be performed  entirely  in the State of Delaware, without reference to that
body of law relating  to  conflicts of law or choice of law. The Parties
further hereby waive  any right to  a trial by jury with respect to any
lawsuit or judicial proceeding  arising or  relating to this Agreement.

 



 

7.9 _Other  Remedies_. Subject to the Unit Purchase Agreement and except as 
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly  conferred
upon  a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other 
remedy  conferred hereby or by law on such party, and the exercise of any 
one remedy  will not preclude the exercise of any other.

 



 

7.10 _Jurisdiction._ Each  party hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of  any Delaware state court or any Federal court
located in the State  of Delaware  in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any transaction  contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat  such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from  any such  court and (iii) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this  Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby in any court other  than any  Delaware state court or
any Federal court sitting in the State of  Delaware.

 



 

7.11 _Specific  Performance_. The parties acknowledge that irreparable
damage  would occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement were 
not  performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise 
breached.  The parties will be entitled to an injunction(s) to prevent
breaches  of the  provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms  and  provisions hereof (including the indemnification provisions
hereof)  in any court  of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction. This is in  addition to any other remedy to which the parties
might be entitled  at law or in  equity.

or  to  such other address as a party designates in a writing delivered to 
each of the  other parties hereto in accordance with this Section  7.12.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, notices, instructions and other 
communications addressed to the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have  been
given  to the Escrow Agent only upon receipt by the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow  Agent may assume without inquiry (unless the Escrow Agent has
written  notice to  the contrary) that notices received by it which are also
required  to be  delivered to another party have, in fact, been delivered to
such  other  party.

 



 

7.13 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of  which shall be  deemed an original as regards any
party whose signature appears thereon,  but all  of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This  Agreement will become binding
when one or more counterparts hereof,  individually  or taken together, bear
the signatures of each of the parties reflected  hereon  as signatories. All
signatures of the parties to this Agreement may  be  transmitted by
facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all purposes,  be deemed  to be the
original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces,  and  will
be binding upon such party.

 



 

7.14 _Security  Procedures._ In the event funds  transfer instructions are
given (other than in writing  at the time of  execution of this Agreement,
as indicated in Section 7.12 above), whether  in writing, by telecopier or
otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized  to seek  confirmation of such
instructions  by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on
_Exhibit  E_ , and the Escrow  Agent may  rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

person  or persons so  designated. Each funds  transfer instruction shall
be executed by an authorized signatory,  a list of  such authorized
signatories is set forth on _Exhibit  E_. The undersigned  is  authorized
to certify that the signatories on _Exhibit  E_ are authorized  signatories.
The  persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only  in a
writing  actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the
Escrow  Agent is  unable to contact any of the authorized representatives
identified  in  _Exhibit  E_ , the Escrow  Agent is  hereby authorized to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone  call-back to any one or
more of your executive officers, (" _Executive  Officers_ "), which  shall
include the titles of  Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
President or Vice  President,  as the Escrow Agent may select. Such
"Executive Officer" shall  deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed
Incumbency Certificate,  and the  Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting  to be any such  officer. The Escrow Agent
and the beneficiary\'s bank in any funds  transfer may  rely solely upon any
account numbers or similar identifying numbers  provided by  Purchaser or
Securityholders' Representatives to identify  (i) the beneficiary, (ii)  the
beneficiary\'s bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow  Agent may
apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it  executes  using
any such identifying number, even when its use may result in  a person 
other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to  a bank
other  than the beneficiary\'s bank or an intermediary bank designated. The 
parties to  this Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures are
commercially  reasonable. Purchaser and Securityholders' Representatives
agree  that repetitive or standing settlement instructions will be
effective  as the  funds transfer instructions of Purchaser or
Securityholders' Representatives,  whether or not authorized, if such
settlement instructions are  verified pursuant to the security procedure
provided herein or such  other  security procedure that the Escrow Agent,
Purchaser or Securityholders' Representatives may  agree to.

 



 

7.15 _Compliance  with Court Orders._ In the event that any Escrow Property
shall be  attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the
delivery  thereof  shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or
any order,  judgment or  decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the  property  deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is
hereby expressly  authorized,  in its sole discretion, to obey and comply
with all writs, orders  or decrees so  entered or issued, which it is
advised by legal counsel of its own  choosing is  binding upon it, whether
with or without jurisdiction, and in the  event that the  Escrow Agent obeys
or complies with any such writ, order or decree  it shall not  be liable to
any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm  or  corporation, by
reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ,  order or  decree be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or  vacated.

 



 

7.16 _Account  Opening Information/Taxpayer Identification Numbers (
"TINs")._

 



 

(a) _Important _ _In_ _formation  About Procedures for  Opening a New
Account_. For  accounts opened in the  United States,  to help the 
government fight the funding  of terrorism and money  laundering activities,
Federal law requires all financial institutions  to  obtain, verify, and
record information that identifies each person  who opens an  account. When
an account is opened, we will ask for information that  will allow us to
identify  relevant  parties.

 



 

(b) _Taxpayer  Identification Numbers ( "_ _ _TINs__ _" )._ The  Parties
have provided the Escrow Agent with their respective fully  executed 
Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

W-8,  or W-9 and/or other required  documentation. The Parties each
represent that its correct TIN  assigned by the IRS or any other taxing
authority, is set forth in  the delivered  forms, as well as in the
Substitute IRS Form W-9 set forth on the  signature page  of this Agreement.
Upon execution of this Agreement, the Parties  shall provide the Escrow Agent
with a fully executed IRS Form W-8,  W-9 and/or  other required
documentation, which shall include the Parties' TINs.

 

 

The  Parties further represent to the  Escrow Agent that the transaction
memorialized in the Unit Purchase  Agreement  does not constitute an
installment sale requiring any tax reporting  or  withholding of imputed
interest or original issue discount to the  IRS or other  taxing authority.

 



 

To  the extent that any portion of the  principal amount of the Escrow
Property represents part or all of  the purchase  price under the Unit
Purchase Agreement, Purchaser shall provide  all information  required for
Escrow Agent to perform tax reporting on IRS Form 1099-B  on or  prior to
upon each distribution. Unless otherwise directed in a joint  written 
instruction executed by the Purchaser and Securityholders' Representatives. 
Escrow Agent shall report to the IRS and as appropriate withhold  and remit
taxes  to the IRS, or any other taxing authority as required by law, based 
upon the  information and documentation so provided and when schedule and
documentation  is  not properly and timely provided prior to payment of
principal to  the Seller.  Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on such
information and documentation  and  shall not be responsible for and shall
be indemnified by Purchaser  for any  additional tax, interest or penalty
arising from the inaccuracy or  late receipt  of such information or
documentation.

 



 

In  addition, all interest or other  income earned under the Agreement shall
be allocated to the Securityholders  shown on _Exhibit A_ and reported, as
and to the extent required by law, by  the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any
other taxing authority, on IRS  Form 1099 or  1042S (or other appropriate
form) as income earned from the Escrow  by the  Securityholders whether or
not said income has been distributed during  such  year. Any other tax
returns required to be filed will be prepared and  filed by the Parties with
the IRS and any other taxing authority  as required by  law, including but
not limited to any applicable reporting or withholding  pursuant to the
Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act  (" _FIRPTA_ "). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that Escrow  Agent shall have no responsibility for the
preparation and/or filing  of any tax  return or any applicable FIRPTA
reporting or withholding with respect  to the  Escrow Property or any income
earned by the Escrow Property. The  Parties further acknowledge and agree
that any taxes payable from  the income  earned on the investment of any
Cash Escrow shall be paid by the  Parties  respectively as required by law.
In the absence of written direction  from the Purchaser and Securityholders'
Representatives, all proceeds of the  Cash Escrow shall be retained in the
Escrow Property and reinvested  from time to  time by the Escrow Agent as
provided in Section this 1.1 of this  Agreement. Escrow Agent shall withhold
any taxes it deems  appropriate, including but not limited to required
withholding in  the absence of  proper tax documentation, and shall remit
such taxes to the appropriate  authorities.

relating to the  offer and  sale of (i) all of the Registrable Securities
and (ii) all shares  of Company  Common Stock that the Company is requested
to register under the  Existing  Shareholder Agreement. Thereafter, the
Company shall use its reasonable  best  efforts to cause such Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared  effective  within 180 days after the
date hereof. The Company shall use its  reasonable best efforts to keep the
Shelf Registration Statement  continuously  effective, subject to the other
provisions of this Section 1.02(a),  in order to  permit the prospectus
included therein to be lawfully delivered by  the Holders  of the relevant
Registrable Securities, until the second anniversary  of the date  hereof or
such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable  Securities
covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold  pursuant thereto
or cease to be outstanding. The Company shall use  its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement  and the  related
prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of  the effective 
date of the Shelf Registration Statement, amendment or supplement,  (i) to 
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements  of the 
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and  (ii)
not  to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state  a
material  fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make 
the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made,  not  misleading (other than with respect to information included
therein  in reliance  upon or in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company  by or on  behalf of any Holder specifically for
use therein). The filing of the  Shelf Registration  Statement and the
causing of the Shelf Registration Statement to  be declared  effective shall
be at the  Company's  own expense as provided  in Section  1.02(c).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement  to the contrary, if
there is (i)  material non-public information regarding the Company which the
Company's Board  of Directors reasonably determines to be significantly
disadvantageous  for the  Company to disclose and which the Company is not
otherwise required  to disclose  at such time, (ii) there is a significant
business opportunity (including  the  acquisition or disposition of assets
(other than in the ordinary  course of  business) or any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, tender offer  or other  similar transaction)
available to the Company which the Board reasonably  determines to be
significantly disadvantageous for the Company to  disclose or  (iii) there
is any other

event  or condition of similar  significance to the Company that the Board
reasonably determines  to be  significantly disadvantageous for the Company
to disclose and which  the Company  is not otherwise required to disclose at
such time (each, a " _Disadvantageous  Condition_ "), and  the  Company's
Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution setting forth  in reasonable 
detail the Disadvantageous  Condition (giving due  regard to any
confidentiality or competitive considerations), then the  Company shall not
be required to file  any amendment or supplement required to maintain the
effectiveness  of the Shelf  Registration until the  earlier of (x) 120 
days following the date such resolution was adopted and  (y) the date such
Disadvantageous  Condition no longer exists (notice of which the Company
shall promptly deliver  to the  Holders) and upon  receipt  of any such
notice of a Disadvantageous Condition all  Holders selling securities 
pursuant to the Shelf Registration  Statement shall discontinue  use of the
prospectus contained in the Shelf  Registration Statement and,  if so
directed by the  Company, each Holder shall  deliver to the Company all 
copies, other than permanent file copies,  then in such Holder's 
possession, of the prospectus then  covering such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt  of such  notice. The  Company shall use it
reasonable best efforts to cause a Disadvantageous  Condition to cease to
apply as soon as practicable after the Company's Board of  Directors
determines that a Disadvantageous Condition applies. The  Company may not
suspend the  effectiveness  or  availability of the Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant  to this Section 1.02(a) for  more than  120
consecutive  days. Within 20  days after receiving a notice of a
Disadvantageous Condition, the  applicable  Requesting Holders may withdraw
any outstanding Demand Request by  giving written  notice thereof to the
Company, and, if withdrawn, such Demand Request  shall be  deemed not to
have been made for purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) _Demand  Offering_. Subject to Section 1.02(a), at any time commencing
on  the date that is 180 days after the date hereof and while the Shelf 
Registration  Statement is effective, upon the written request (a " _Demand
Request_ ") of  a Holder or Holders (" _Requesting Holders_ ") requesting
that the Company  effect an underwritten offering (a " _Company Funded
Offering_ ") of  Registrable Securities of such Requesting Holders
representing at  least the  Minimum Demand Request Amount (which request
shall specify the number  of shares  of Registrable Securities to be offered
by such Requesting Holders,  subject to  reduction to the extent provided
herein), the Company shall promptly  (but in no  event more than five
Business Days after receipt of the applicable  Demand  Request) deliver
written notice of such requested registration to  all other  Holders of
Registrable Securities and shall use its reasonable best  efforts to 
effect, as expeditiously as possible, an underwritten offering of  (i) the 
Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to  register
by  the Requesting Holders, (ii) all other Registrable Securities which  the
Company  has been requested to register by any other Holder thereof by
written  request  received by the Company within 15 days after the giving of
such written  notice  by the Company (which request shall specify the number
of shares  of Registrable  Securities to be offered by such Holder, subject
to reduction as  provided  herein) and (iii) all shares of Company Common
Stock that the Company  may be  required to allow to participate in such
underwritten offering under  the  Existing Shareholder Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) the  Company shall not be  required

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

6

 

 

 

 



 

to effect  any such underwritten  offering within a period  of  six
months after  (x) the date  of any other underwritten offering  of Company
Common Stock or (y) the effective date of any other registration  or 
offering in which the Holders are permitted to participate pursuant  to
Section  1.03; and (B) the Company  shall only be obligated to effect a
total of two Company  Funded  Offerings. Each underwritten offering under
this Section 1.02 shall  be at the  Company's  own expense as provided  in
Section  1.02(c). Promptly  after the expiration of the  15-day period 
referred to  in clause (ii) above, the Company shall notify all the Holders
to  be included in  the underwritten  offering of the identity  of  each
such Holder and the number of shares of Registrable Securities  requested
to  be included therein. The  Requesting Holders  may, at any time prior to
the  pricing of the applicable  underwritten offering, revoke the applicable
Demand Request, without  liability (except as set  forth in Section
1.02(c))  to any other Holders of Registrable  Securities requested to be
registered pursuant to this Section 1.02(b),  by providing a written notice
to  the Company revoking  such  request.

 

 

(c) _Expenses._ The  Company shall pay all  Registration Expenses in
connection with the Shelf Registration  Statement and all  underwritten
offerings requested pursuant to Section 1.02(b) that  are  consummated.

with  an underwritten  offering that shall  not  have been  consummated
due to a  revocation by the Holders requesting such underwritten  offering
(other than  pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.02(a)) unless
(i) such Holders  agree that such revoked  underwritten offering  counts
as one of the Company Funded  Offerings or (ii) at the  time of such
revocation, the Holders shall have learned of a material  adverse  change in
the condition, business or prospects of the Company from  that known to  the
Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request  with 
reasonable promptness after learning of such information. Except  as provided
in the preceding  sentence, the obligation  to  pay the Registration
Expenses in connection with  such revoked underwritten  offering shall be
due  and payable by the Holders  who participated in such underwritten 
offering or who initially  requested and revoked  such underwritten 
offering, and such  expenses  shall be borne by them in proportion to  the
number of shares of Registrable  Securities requested by them to be
registered.

 

 

(d) _Selection  of  Underwriters._ The Company shall have the right to
select the  underwriters for each Company Funded Offering; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that (i) the Holders selling a majority-in-interest of
Registrable  Securities to  be sold in connection with the relevant
registration shall have the  right to  select one joint lead bookrunning
underwriter (but not the joint  lead  bookrunning underwriter that will be
on the left of the cover page  of any  offering materials related to such
registration or the stabilization  agent),  which joint lead bookrunning
underwriter shall have participation  in pricing and  bookbuilding and shall
be subject to the reasonable approval of the  Company, and  (ii) the Company
shall be entitled to select no more than two additional  joint  lead
bookrunning underwriters.

joint  lead bookrunning underwriters selected in accordance with Section 
1.02(d) shall  advise the Company that, in their good faith view (based upon
prevailing  market  conditions), the number of securities requested to be
included  in such  registration (including securities which the Company
requests to  be included)  exceeds the largest number of securities which
can be sold without  having a  significant negative effect on the price at
which such securities  can be sold in  such offering, the Company shall
include the following Company  Common Stock in  the following order:

SECTION  1.03. _Certain Piggyback  Registration  Rights._ (a) _General._
If, at any time  on or prior to the second anniversary of the date hereof,
the Company  at any  time proposes to register any of its equity securities
(the " _Priority  Securities_ ") under the Securities Act (other than a
registration (i) on  Form S-8 or S-4 or any successor or similar forms, (ii)
relating  to equity  securities issuable upon exercise of employee stock or
similar options  or in  connection with any employee benefit or similar plan
of the Company,  (iii) in  connection with an acquisition by the Company of
another entity or  (iv) pursuant  to a

registration  under Section 1.02), whether or not for sale for its own
account (but not  for the account of any Holder of Registrable Securities),
in a manner  which  would permit registration of Registrable Securities for
sale to the  public under  the Securities Act, it shall each such time,
subject to the provisions  of  Section 1.03(b), give written notice to all
Holders of record of  Registrable Securities of its intention to do so and of
such Holders' rights  under this Section 1.03 at least 10 days prior to the
anticipated filing  date of the registration statement relating to such 
registration. Such notice shall offer all such Holders the  opportunity to
include in such registration statement such number  of Registrable 
Securities as each such Holder may request. Upon the written request  of any
such Holder made within 10 days after the receipt of the Company's notice 
(which request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities  intended
to be  disposed of by such Holder, subject to reduction as provided herein, 
and the  intended method of disposition thereof), the Company shall use its 
reasonable  best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities
Act  of all  Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested
to  register by  the Holders thereof, to the extent required to permit the
disposition  (in  accordance with such intended methods thereof) of the
Registrable  Securities so  to be registered; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(A) if such registration  involves an underwritten offering, all Holders of
Registrable Securities  requesting to be included in the Company's
registration must sell their  Registrable Securities to the underwriters
selected by the Company  on the same  terms and conditions as apply to the
Company or the original selling  holders for  whose account the registration
has been made and (B) if, at any time after  giving written notice of its
intention to register any securities  pursuant to  this Section 1.03(a) and
prior to the effective date of the registration  statement filed in
connection with such registration, the Company  shall  determine for any
reason not to register such securities, the Company  shall give  written
notice to all Holders of Registrable Securities and, thereupon,  shall be 
relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities  in
connection  with such registration (without prejudice, however, to rights
of  Holders under  Section 1.02). If a registration pursuant to this 
Section 1.03(a) involves an underwritten public offering, any Holder of 
Registrable Securities requesting to be included in such registration  may
elect,  in writing prior to the effective date of the registration
statement  filed in  connection with such registration, not to register such
securities  in connection  with such registration. No registration effected
under this  Section 1.03 shall relieve the Company of its obligations under 
Section 1.02. The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in  connection
with each registration of Registrable Securities pursuant  to this  Section
1.03. Nothing contained in this Section 1.03 shall  create any liability on
the part of the Company to the Holders if  the Company  should for any
reason decide not to file a registration statement  for which  piggyback
registration rights are available or withdraw such registration  statement
subsequent to its filing, regardless of any action Holders  may have  taken,
whether as a result of the issuance by the Company of any  notice  hereunder
or otherwise.

(b) _Priority  in Piggyback  Registrations._ If a registration pursuant to

their good faith  view (based primarily upon prevailing market conditions),
the number  of  securities (including all Registrable  Securities) which
the Company, the Holders and any other Persons  intend to  include in such
registration exceeds the largest number of securities  which can  be sold
without having a significant negative effect on the price  at which such 
securities can be sold in such offering, the Company will include  in such 
registration in the following order:

 

 

 

(i) all  Registrable  Securities requested to be included in such
underwritten offering  by the Holders  pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and all
Company Common Stock requested to be  included in such underwritten offering

the Company Common Stock requested to be  included in such underwritten
offering pursuant to the Existing Shareholders  Agreement exceeds the number
which the Company has been advised can  be sold in  such underwritten
offering without having the negative effect referred  to above,  the number
of such Registrable Securities requested to be included  in such 
underwritten offering by the Holders pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and the 
number of Company Common Stock requested to be included in such underwritten 
offering pursuant to the Existing Shareholders Agreement shall be  allocated
pro  rata among all such requesting Holders and such requesting holders  of
Company  Common Stock on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities 
and Company  Common Stock each such other Holder or holder, respectively,
has  requested to be  included in such underwritten offering); and

 

 

(ii) to  the extent that the  number of Registrable Securities and Company
Common Stock requested  to be  included in such underwritten offering
pursuant to Section 1.03(a)  and the  Existing Shareholders Agreement,
respectively, is, in the aggregate,  less than  the number of securities
which the Company has been advised can be  sold in such  underwritten
offering without having the significant negative effect  on pricing 
referred to above, all the Priority Securities (including any to  be sold for
the  Company's own account or for other holders of Priority Securities
(other  than  for the account of any Holders)) ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the  number of Registrable Securities and Company Common Stock
requested  to be  included in such underwritten offering pursuant to Section
1.03(a)  and the  Existing Shareholders Agreement, together with the number
of Priority  Securities  to be included in such underwritten offering
pursuant to this clause  (ii),  exceeds the number which the Company has
been advised can be sold  in such  offering without having the negative
effect referred to above, the  number of  such Priority Securities to be
included in such underwritten offering  shall be  allocated pro rata among
all holders of Priority Securities on the  basis of the  number of Priority
Securities each such holder has requested to be  included in  such
underwritten offering).

misleading, and the Company shall promptly prepare and file  with the SEC

each Underwriter  and the  other Sellers, and each of their respective
partners, directors,  officers and  employees (including each director and
officer of the Company who  signed the  relevant registration statement) and
each Person, if any, who controls  the  Company, any Underwriter or any
other Seller within the meaning of  Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against  any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, damages, judgments and expenses  described in the indemnity contained
in Section 1.06(a) ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any settlement of the
type described therein  is effected  with the written consent of such
Seller) as incurred, but only with  respect to  untrue statements or
omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions,  made  in a
registration statement or any related prospectus (or any amendment  or 
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written 
information  furnished to the Company by such Seller expressly for use in
such  registration  statement (or any amendment thereto) or such prospectus
(or any amendment  or  supplement thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that an
indemnifying  Seller shall not be required to provide indemnification in any
amount  in excess  of the amount by which (x) the total price at which the
securities  sold by such  indemnifying Seller and its affiliated
indemnifying Sellers and distributed  to  the public were offered to the
public (net of discounts and commissions  paid by  the indemnifying Seller
in connection with such offering) exceeds  (y) the amount  of any damages
which such indemnifying Seller has otherwise been  required to pay  by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission  or alleged 
omission. The Company shall be entitled, to the extent customary,  to
receive  indemnification and contribution from underwriters, selling
brokers,  dealer  managers and similar securities industry professionals
participating  in the  distribution, to the same extent as provided above
with respect to  information  so furnished in writing by such Persons
specifically for inclusion  in any  prospectus or registration statement.

 

 

(c) Each  indemnified party  or parties shall give reasonably prompt notice
to each indemnifying  party or  parties of any action or proceeding
commenced against it in respect  of which  indemnity may be sought
hereunder, but failure so to notify an indemnifying  party or parties shall
not relieve it or them from any liability  which it or  they may have under
this indemnity agreement, except to the extent  that the  indemnifying party
is materially prejudiced by such failure to give  notice. If  the
indemnifying party or parties so elects within a reasonable time  after 
receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party or parties may assume  the
defense  of such action or proceeding at such indemnifying party's or
parties' expense  with counsel chosen by the indemnifying party or parties
and approved  by the  indemnified party defendant in such action or
proceeding, which approval  shall  not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_
, _however_ , that, if such  indemnified party or parties reasonably
determine that a conflict  of interest  exists and that therefore it is
advisable for such indemnified party  or parties  to be represented by
separate counsel or that, upon advice of counsel,  there may  be legal
defenses available to it or them which are different from  or in  addition
to those available to the indemnifying party, then the indemnifying  party or
parties shall not be entitled to assume such defense and  the  indemnified
party or parties shall be entitled to separate counsel  (limited in  each
jurisdiction to one counsel for all Underwriters and another  counsel for 
all other

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

17

 

 

 

 



 

indemnified  parties under this Agreement) at the indemnifying party's or
parties' expense. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to 
engage separate counsel and participate in the defense of any action,  but, 
except as stated above, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall  be the 
expense of such indemnified party or parties. If any indemnifying  party or
parties are not so entitled to assume the defense of such  action or do  not
assume such defense, after having received the notice referred  to in the 
first sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party or parties  will pay
the  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified party  or
parties  (limited in each jurisdiction to one counsel for all Underwriters 
and another  counsel for all other indemnified parties under this
Agreement).  In such event,  however, no indemnifying party or parties will
be liable for any  settlement  effected without the written consent of such
indemnifying party or  parties  (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if at any time the
indemnified party or parties  shall have  requested the indemnifying party
or parties to reimburse the indemnified  party  or parties for fees and
expenses of counsel as contemplated by this  paragraph,  the indemnifying
party or parties shall be liable for any settlement  of any  proceeding
effected without the written consent of such indemnifying  party or  parties
if (x) such settlement is entered into more than 15 business  days after 
receipt by such indemnifying party or parties of the aforesaid request 
accompanied by supporting documents reasonably satisfactory to the 
indemnifying  party or parties and (y) such indemnifying party or parties
shall  not have  reimbursed the indemnified party or parties in accordance
with such  request  prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying
party or  parties shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified  party or  parties, effect any settlement of any action in
respect of which  any indemnified  party or parties is a party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional  release of such indemnified party or
parties from all liability on  claims that  are the subject matter of such
action. If an indemnifying party is  entitled to assume, and assumes, the
defense of such action or proceeding  in  accordance with this paragraph,
such indemnifying party or parties  shall not,  except as otherwise provided
in this subsection (c), be liable for  any fees and  expenses of counsel for
the indemnified parties incurred thereafter  in  connection with such action
or proceeding.

 

 

(d) (i) In  order  to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in  which the  indemnity agreement provided for in this
Section 1.06 is for any  reason held to  be unenforceable by the indemnified
parties although applicable in  accordance  with its terms in respect of any
losses, liabilities, claims, damages,  judgments  and expenses suffered by
an indemnified party referred to therein,  each  applicable indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified  party,  shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified  party as a  result of such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and  expenses in  such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of  the Company 
on the one hand and of the liable Sellers or Underwriters (including,  in
each  case, that of their respective officers, directors, employees and 
agents), as  the case may be, on the other in connection with the statements
or  omissions  which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages,
judgments  or  expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations.  The relative  fault of the Company on the one hand and of
the liable Sellers or  Underwriters  (including, in each

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

18

 

 

 

 



 

case,  that of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents), 
as the case  may be, on the other shall be determined by reference to, among
other  things,  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact  or the  omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to  information  supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by or on
behalf of the  Sellers or  Underwriters, on the other, and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access  to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement  or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses,  liabilities,  claims, damages, judgments
and expenses referred to above shall be  deemed to  include, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 1.06(c), any legal  or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection  with 
investigating or defending any action or claim.

 

 

(ii) The  Company and each  Seller agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution  pursuant to  this Section 1.06 were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any  other method  of allocation which does not
take account of the equitable considerations  referred to in sub-paragraph
(i) above. Notwithstanding anything  in this Section  1.06(d) to the
contrary, in the case of distributions to the public,  an  indemnifying
Seller shall not be required to contribute any amount  in excess of  the
amount by which (A) the total price at which the securities sold  by such 
indemnifying Seller and its affiliated indemnifying Sellers and distributed 
to  the public were offered to the public (net of discounts and commissions 
paid by  the indemnifying Seller in connection with such offering) exceeds 
(B) the amount  of any damages which such indemnifying Seller has otherwise
been  required to pay  by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement
or omission  or alleged  omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within  the meaning  of Section 11(f) of the Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution  from  any Person who was not guilty
of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

 

(iii) For  purposes of this  Section, each Person, if any, who controls a
Seller or an Underwriter  within the  meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the  Exchange Act  shall have the same
rights to contribution as such Seller or Underwriter;  and  each director of
the Company, each officer of the Company who signed  the  relevant
registration statement, and each Person, if any, who controls  the  Company
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or  Section 20 of 
the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the  Company.

 

 

SECTION  1.07. _Miscellaneous_ _._

 

 

(a) _Current  Public  Information_. The Company shall use its reasonable

(l) _Severability._ In  the event that any one or more of the provisions

privileges of the parties shall  be  enforceable to the fullest extent

(m) _No  Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as provided in Section 1.06,

21

 

 

 

 



 

brought  in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, 
with respect to  such Proceeding, that such court does not have jurisdiction
over  such party; (c)  consents to the service of process at the address set
forth for notices  in  Section 1.07(g) herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such manner of  service of process shall not preclude the service of process

jury in connection  with any  Proceeding.

 

 

(o) _Enforcement_. (i) Each  party hereto acknowledges that the other parties
would not have an  adequate  remedy at law for money damages in the event
that any of the covenants  or  agreements of any of the other parties to
this Agreement were not  performed in  accordance with its terms, and it is
therefore agreed that each party  hereto, in  addition to and without
limiting any other remedy or right it may  have, will  have the right to an
injunction or other equitable relief in any  court of  competent
jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically  the 
terms and provisions hereof, and each party hereto hereby waives  any and
all  defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or
competence  of the  court to grant such an injunction or other equitable
relief.

 

 

(ii)  All rights, powers and remedies  provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof  at law or  in equity shall be
cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise  or beginning  of the
exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the  simultaneous 
or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such  party.
