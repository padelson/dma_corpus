and transferred to Buyer on the terms set forth in this Agreement for no
additional consideration and without the requirement of any further action of
any other Person, as of the Closing, except to the extent the date of such
consent or action is deemed by applicable Law to have occurred on another

subject to the adjustment set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.09_, shall be an
amount (the " _Purchase Price_ ") equal to (i) US$565,000,000 in cash, _minus_
(ii) the Estimated Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Adjustment Amount,
_minus_ (iii) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_ (iv) the
Estimated Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount, _minus_ (v) any amounts in
respect of Site Property Values for Failed ROFR Waiver Properties pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.24_.

(b) As soon as commercially reasonably possible after the Determination Date,
but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller, for Sellers review, comment
and consent an allocation of the 

 



26  final Purchase Price (plus the amount of Assumed Liabilities to the extent
properly taken into account for U.S. federal and other applicable Income Tax
purposes) among the Purchased Assets and the IPCo Interests, consistent with
the procedures in _Section_ __ _ 2.09_ and in accordance with applicable Law
including Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury regulations thereunder (the "
_Draft Allocation Statement_ "). If Seller does not object in writing to the
Draft Allocation Statement within thirty (30) days after receipt, the Draft
Allocation Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties (and shall
become the " _Final Purchase Price Allocation_ "). If Seller does object in
writing to the Draft Allocation Statement within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Draft Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve their differences with
respect to the Draft Allocation Statement. If Buyer and Seller resolve such
differences within such thirty (30) day period, the Draft Allocation
Statement, as amended to reflect any changes agreed to by Buyer and Seller,
shall become the Final Purchase Price Allocation. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve their differences within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer
and Seller shall submit such dispute to an independent nationally recognized
accounting firm. Such dispute shall be resolved by such accounting firm, and
the Draft Allocation Statement, as amended to reflect the resolution by such
accounting firm, shall become the Final Purchase Price Allocation. The costs
and expenses associated with such accounting firms resolution shall be borne
and paid one-half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2) by Seller. Promptly after
any adjustment to the amount of the Purchase Price, including pursuant to
_ARTICLE VI_ and _ARTICLE IX_ , the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
mutually agree to appropriate revisions to the Draft Allocation Statement or
Final Purchase Price Allocation, as applicable. The Parties agree that they
will not, and will not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, take a
position (except as required by a Governmental Authority) on any Tax Return
(including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) or in any
audit or examination before any Governmental Authority that is in any way
inconsistent with the Final Purchase Price Allocation (as such may be
adjusted), if any; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates from settling, or require them
to litigate before any court, any challenge, proposed deficiency or adjustment
by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Final Purchase
Price Allocation, if any. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of Buyer and Seller shall notify the other Party of any such Action taken
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Final Purchase
Price Allocation, if any, and neither Party shall settle or otherwise
compromise such Action without the other Partys prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in no
event more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a

 



28  written statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, (i) its good faith
estimate of (A) the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness related to the
Business as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), and (B) the
Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash
Adjustment Amount_ "), (ii) reasonable supporting documentation for such
estimates, (iii) Sellers good faith estimate of the Non-Operating Restaurants
Sale Proceeds Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated  Non-Operating Restaurants
Sale Proceeds Adjustment Amount_") and (v) a schedule reflecting all Permitted
Non-Operating Restaurant Sales between (and inclusive of) November 15, 2016
and the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and the sales price of and
net proceeds (determined on an after-Tax basis) received or receivable by
Seller or its Subsidiaries with respect to each such sale. Estimated Closing
Date Indebtedness shall be calculated in accordance with the definition
thereof, and each of the Estimated Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount and the
Estimated Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Adjustment Amount shall be
calculated in accordance with the definitions thereof.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within ninety (90) days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller (i) an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Business as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all
Indebtedness related to the Business as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet
as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (iii) a calculation of the Closing
Date Cash Adjustment Amount and (iv) a calculation of the Non-Operating
Restaurants Sale Proceeds Adjustment Amount (such calculation, the " _Buyer 
Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Calculation_"), in each case,
determined without giving effect to (A) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustments as a result of the
application of purchase accounting) or (B) any financing transactions in
connection therewith, by Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Closing. The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and in a
manner consistent with _Schedule 1.01(e)_. Following the Closing until the
Determination Date (as defined below), each Party shall provide the other
Party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
and following reasonable written notice to the records, properties, personnel
and (subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if
requested) auditors of such Party reasonably relating to the preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds
Calculation and/or Dispute Notice (as defined below), as applicable, and shall
cause the personnel of such Party and its Subsidiaries to reasonably
cooperate with the other Party and its Representatives in connection with
their review of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants
Sale Proceeds Calculation and/or Dispute Notice, as applicable. 

(c) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Date Indebtedness,
the Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount or the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants
Sale Proceeds Calculation, it shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in
writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), within thirty (30) days after its
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that Seller does not
provide such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30)-day
period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculations of the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash
Adjustment Amount and the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds

 



29  Calculation delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is
timely provided, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith for a period
of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations of the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount or the Buyer Non-
Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Calculation. If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Deloitte and Touche
LLP (or such independent accounting or financial consulting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller)
(the " _Auditor_ "), acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall
resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Auditor, whether the Closing Balance Sheet was
prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in _Section 2.09(b)_ and
(only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor)
whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing
Date Cash Adjustment Amount or the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants Sale
Proceeds Calculation require adjustment. The Auditor shall not be permitted to
make a determination with respect to any item as to which there is a
disagreement that exceeds or is less than the greatest or lowest value,
respectively, for such item as claimed by the Parties, shall limit its review
to the disputed items, and shall limit its review to whether the Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculations of the Closing Date Indebtedness, the
Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount and the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants
Sale Proceeds Calculation were prepared in accordance with this Agreement or
contain mathematical/clerical error. The Auditor shall base its determination
solely on the written submissions of the Parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation. All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be divided
equally between Buyer and Seller. The determination of the Auditor shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The date on which the
Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount and the
Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Calculation are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.09(c)_ is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Determination Date_."

 

(d) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness,  _minus_ the Closing Date
Indebtedness, _plus_ (ii) the Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount, _minus_
(iii) the Estimated Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount _plus_ (iv) the
Estimated Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Adjustment Amount _minus_
the Buyer Non-Operating Restaurants Sale Proceeds Calculation. If the
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall be
increased by such Adjustment Amount (the " _Increase Amount_ "), and if the
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Purchase Price shall be decreased
by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (the " _Deficit Amount_ ").
The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section 2.09(e)_.

 

(e) If there is an Increase Amount, then, promptly following the Determination
Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination
Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller in writing an amount in
cash equal to the Increase Amount. If there is a Deficit Amount, then,
promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days of the Determination Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Buyer in writing an amount in cash equal to the Deficit Amount.

 



30 Section 2.10 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to any such payments under the Code or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Law. If Buyer determines
that any such deduction or withholding is required in respect of any payment
payable pursuant to this Agreement (other than any compensatory withholding),
Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice prior to the date of the
applicable payment, shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to mitigate any
such requirement to the extent permitted by Law and, if any deduction or
withholding is necessary, shall provide Seller with a receipt from
the applicable Taxing Authority documenting the remittance of such deduction
or withholding under the Code or any such Law, if available, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of such deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and duly deposited with the
appropriate Taxing Authority by Buyer, such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

forth, or required to be

 



35  set forth, in _Schedule 3.08_ (each, a " _Material Contract_ ") is a valid

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that:

 

Section 4.01 _Corporate_ _Existence_ _and_ _Power_. Buyer is a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate or equivalent
organizational power and authority to own or lease its assets and to conduct
its business in all material respects as it is now being conducted. Buyer is
duly licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or
operation of its assets or the character of its activities is such as to
require it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.02 _Corporate_ _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby are within the
limited liability company powers of Buyer and have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally
and to general principles of equity. Each other Transaction Document to which
Buyer is a party shall be duly and validly executed by Buyer at or prior to
the Closing and, upon such execution and delivery by Buyer and the due and
valid execution and delivery of such Transaction Document by each other party
thereto, shall constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity.

 

Section 4.03 _Governmental_ _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby require no material
action by or in respect of, or material filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR
Act and other Competition Laws.

 



48 Section 4.04 _Noncontravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and shall not (i)
violate the Organizational Documents of Buyer, (ii) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.03_, violate any Law, (iii)
require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default
under or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any material right or obligation or to a loss of any material benefit to
which Buyer is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon Buyer or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of
any material Lien on any asset of Buyer (except, in the case of clauses (iii)
and (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents).

Section 4.05 _Financing_. Buyer has delivered to Seller a true and complete
copy of the executed Equity Commitment Letter, attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(including the exhibits and annexes thereto). The Equity Commitment Letter has
not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this
Agreement. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any
agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to the Financing of the
Purchase Price, other than as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. The
aggregate proceeds of the Financing, when funded, will be sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the
Purchase Price on the Closing Date. The commitments contained in the Equity
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The
Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of Buyer and each other party thereto, to
provide the Financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of the Financing Conditions and except as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights and remedies generally, by general
equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority
before which any Action seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
_ARTICLE III_ , as of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default on the part of Buyer or any other party thereto under the Equity
Commitment Letter, other than any such default or breach that has been
irrevocably waived by the applicable Equity Investor, as the case may be, or
otherwise cured. Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
amounts that are required to be paid on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Financing. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than the Financing Conditions. Buyer understands
and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Buyers obligation
to consummate the acquisition is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise
subject to Buyers consummation of any financing arrangements, Buyers
obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension
of any financing to Buyer.

 



49 Section 4.06 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions
pending against or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing against,
Buyer, except for such Actions as would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

Section 4.07 _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
Assuming that the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Financing), at and immediately after the Closing, Buyer and each of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair
value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the
present fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount
required to pay its probable Liability on its recourse debts as they mature
or become due); (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to
engage in its business; and (c) will not have incurred and does not plan to
incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

Section 4.08 _Finders _ _Fees_. Except for UBS Securities LLC, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates who might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.09 _Inspections;_ _No_ _Other_ _Representations;_ _Non-Reliance_.
Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert
advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of property and assets
such as the Purchased Assets and IPCo Interests as contemplated hereunder.
Buyer has undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and has
evaluated such documents and information as it has deemed necessary to enable
it to make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that
Seller has given Buyer access to the key employees, documents and facilities
of the Business. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Purchased Assets
and the IPCo Interests are sold "as is", except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate delivered in connection
herewith, including the Transaction Documents. Buyer agrees to accept the
Purchased Assets, the IPCo Interests and the Business in the condition they
are in on the Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and
determination with respect to all matters, and Buyer expressly acknowledges
and agrees that it is not relying on any express or implied representations
or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other agreement or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, including the Transaction
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate
delivered in

 



50  connection herewith, including the Transaction Documents, Buyer acknowledges
that Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer or
its Representatives of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Business or the future business and operations of
the Business.

Section 4.10 _Purchase_ _for_ _Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the IPCo
Interests for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or
together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the IPCo Interests and is capable of bearing
the economic risks of such investment. Buyer has been formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the
Closing Date will have engaged in no other business activities and will have
incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or in the
other Transaction Documents.

sale process or alternative transactions and information and analysis
(including financial analysis) relating to such bids or alternative
transactions, and (ii) as and to the extent necessary to avoid contravention
or waiver, Seller and its Subsidiaries may withhold any document
or information the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to
violate any Contract or any Law or would result in the waiver of any legal
privilege or work-product privilege; provided that to the extent practicable,
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of this
subclause (ii) apply. Seller shall have the right to have a Representative
present at all times during any such inspections, interviews and
examinations. Buyer shall hold in confidence all such information upon the
terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller, which may

consultants of, vendors to, or customers of, Seller or its Subsidiaries about

55  unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, contact corporate executive-level Business Employees set forth
on _Schedule 5.02_ , to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Buyer to
implement transition plans to operate the Business from and after the Closing;
provided, that, prior to the Closing, the consent of Seller shall be required
to begin discussions relating to compensation or the terms and conditions of
employment.

Section 5.03 _Regulatory_ _Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
desirable under Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with
any Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party waives
compliance with the provisions of any bulk transfer or any similar laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or
cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Affiliates under all the Competition Laws of the jurisdictions set
forth in _Schedule 5.03(b)_ with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date hereof, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under any
Competition Law for additional information, documents, or other materials
received by each of them or any of their respective Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such transactions,
and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Authority under any Competition Laws with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. Each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to the other Party all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, to the
extent permitted by Law, responding to any reasonable requests for copies of
documents filed with the non-filing Partys prior filings). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other Parties
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient Party, and the recipient Party shall cause such
outside counsel not to disclose such materials or information to any
employees, officers, directors or other representatives of the recipient
Party or its Affiliates, unless express written permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials. Unless prohibited by applicable Law,
such Party shall promptly inform the other Party hereto of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
Party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting with any 

 



56  Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or
other inquiry without giving the other Party hereto prior notice of the
meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the
Parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto
relating to proceedings under the Competition Laws. Buyer and Seller shall
each pay fifty percent (50%) of all filing fees in connection with all filings
under the Competition Laws.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations
described in _Section 5.03(b)_ , each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the Competition Laws; provided, that, except with
respect to any inquiries or requests for additional information from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the HSR Act or other Competition Law,
if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any
Competition Law, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, limits or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed or construed to require Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to take any of the following actions: (i) propose, negotiate, offer
to commit or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition (including by licensing any Business
Intellectual Property or IPCo Intellectual Property) of any assets of the
Business and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
entities with assets or businesses); (ii) terminate any existing relationships
and contractual rights and obligations; or (iii) otherwise offer to take or
offer to commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets of the Business and/or
any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or equity
interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in entities with assets or
businesses). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Sellers and
Buyers obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall not include any
obligation on the part of Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates to
commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or
otherwise the sale or disposition of such of its assets or businesses
(including the Business) as may be required to be divested in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing, delaying or
limiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



57 Section 5.04 _Permits_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to provide all notices and otherwise take all actions to transfer, reissue or
obtain any Permits required to be transferred, reissued or obtained as a
result of or in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable and, in any case, prior to Closing, and to
the extent necessary, Buyer and Seller shall each use their commercially
reasonable efforts to secure from the applicable Governmental Authority
consent to the issuance of any necessary temporary or provisional Permits
required for Buyers continued operation of the Business following the
Closing. The applications and related documentation prepared in respect of
such Permits, as well as the choice of entities and transaction structure
implemented in relation to obtaining such Permits, shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith and each of them shall comply with and carry out any and all
commercially reasonable requirements, demands, requests, rules, and
regulations of the local issuing authority, so as to expedite the approval of
the issuance or transfer of such Permits. To the extent that any Permit has
not been obtained prior to Closing, until such Permits are obtained, Buyer and
Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts, at either Partys
request, to cooperate with each other to obtain such Permits. During such
time period, Seller or the applicable Retained Subsidiary shall comply with
all applicable covenants and obligations under such Permits, including the
payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which shall be
performed by Seller or the applicable Retained Subsidiary for Buyers account
and Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days
following receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from Seller (which invoices
shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a monthly basis and shall aggregate
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses and payment of obligations made by Seller
in respect of such Permit during such month, together with reasonable
supporting documentation)) reimburse Seller for any out-of-pocket costs,
expenses or payments made by Seller in respect of such arrangements. During
such time period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the applicable Permit, Buyer shall be entitled to receive all of the benefits
of Seller or the applicable Retained Subsidiary under such Permit, and if,
during such time period, Buyer would be unable to operate any portion of a
Restaurant due to Sellers retention of such Permit, Seller shall retain and
operate such Restaurant for the benefit of Buyer and shall provide to Buyer
any net profit received from such operations; provided that any out-of-pocket
costs, expenses or payments that are reimbursed by Buyer shall not reduce net
profit. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnitees harmless
from and against any and all Liabilities based upon, arising out of or
relating to the performance of, or failure to perform, any obligations under
such Permit that are for the benefit of Buyer other than in the case of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Seller Indemnitees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, following the
Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall renew any Permit upon the
expiration or termination thereof if required for Buyers continued operation
of the applicable Restaurant and, as of such time, there shall not have been
transferred, reissued or obtained a Permit as referred to in the second
sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.04_. In addition, to the extent that any
such Permit contains an "evergreen" provision that automatically renews such
Permit unless terminated or cancelled by either party thereto, Seller and
its Affiliates shall not terminate or cancel such Permit if such Permit is
required for Buyers continued operation of the applicable Restaurant and, as
of such time, there shall not have been transferred, reissued or obtained a
Permit as referred to in the second sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_.
Buyer and Seller shall each bear one half (1/2) of the filing fees with
respect to obtaining any such Permits with respect to the

 



58  purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Business;
provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any further
Liabilities or provide any further financial accommodation in connection
therewith.

Section 5.05 _Shared_ _Contracts_. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to,
cooperate and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Shared Contracts to be replaced with separate contract rights and
obligations (the " _Replacement Contracts_ ") that provide Buyer with
contract rights and obligations (including as to pricing metrics) under the
Shared Contracts that are substantially similar to those contract rights and
obligations (including as to pricing metrics) utilized by Seller in the
conduct of the Business prior to the Closing. Buyer and Seller shall each bear
one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses associated with first obtaining
and/or entering into any Replacement Contract (e.g., transfer fees, deposits,
etc.); provided, however, that neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to
incur any further Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation in
connection therewith or in connection with its obligations pursuant to
Backstop Shared Contracts pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_; provided,
further, that Buyer shall be responsible for all ongoing (i.e., going forward,
including payments due at the time of first obtaining and/or entering into
any Replacement Contract intended to cover Buyers and its Subsidiaries going
forward costs) costs or fees required to be paid under a Replacement Contract
or Backstop Shared Contract or any alternative arrangements entered into
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and
provide each other with reasonable assistance in effecting such separation of
the Shared Contracts prior to the Closing and for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days following the Closing. If Buyer and Seller are not able to
effect the separation of a Shared Contract (each a " _Backstop Shared
Contract_ "), until any such Backstop Shared Contract is separated or
otherwise replaced, but in no event longer than one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Closing, to the extent permissible under Law and under the terms
of such Backstop Shared Contract, (i) Seller shall continue to perform the
obligations under such Backstop Shared Contract at the sole cost and expense
of Buyer (i.e., Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30)
days following receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from Seller,
reimburse Seller for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses or payments of
obligations made by Seller under such Backstop Shared Contract (which invoices
shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a monthly basis and shall aggregate
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses and payment of obligations made by Seller
under all Backstop Shared Contracts during such month, together with
reasonable supporting documentation)), and Buyer shall indemnify and hold the
Seller Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Liabilities based
upon, arising out of or relating to the interim arrangements contemplated by
this clause (i) with respect to the Backstop Shared Contracts, except to the
extent any such Liability arises out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller, (ii) Buyer and Seller shall hold in trust for the
benefit of the other Party, and shall promptly forward to the other Party, any
monies or other benefits received pursuant to such Backstop Shared Contract
relating to the respective businesses of the other Party (or its respective
Affiliates) and (iii) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to institute alternative arrangements intended to put the Parties in a
substantially similar economic position as if such Backstop Shared Contract
were separated into Replacement Contracts in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 5.05_; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Closing, (x) Seller and its Affiliates shall

 



59  renew each Shared Contract upon the expiration or termination thereof if
Buyer has not entered into a Replacement Contract in respect of such Shared
Contract, unless Buyer confirms to Seller in writing that Buyer does not need
to receive the benefit of such Shared Contract, and (y) to the extent any such
Shared Contract contains an "evergreen" provision that automatically renews
such Shared Contract unless terminated or cancelled by Seller or its
Affiliates, Seller and its Affiliates shall not terminate or cancel such
Shared Contract if Buyer has not entered into a Replacement Contract in
respect of such Shared Contract, unless Buyer confirms to Seller in
writing that Buyer does not need to receive the benefit of such Shared
Contract. For a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing,
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to replace any Backstop Shared
Contracts to the extent such Backstop Shared Contracts are not separated or
transitioned hereunder and, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be under
no obligation hereunder (x) to deliver to Buyer the same pricing metrics in
any Shared Contract in connection with obtaining any Replacement Contract in
respect thereof or providing an alternative arrangement with respect to a
Backstop Shared Contract or (y) after the Closing Date to separate or
transition, or provide Buyer with any rights or benefits under, any Shared
Contract. With respect to Liabilities pursuant to, under or relating to a
given Backstop Shared Contract, such Liabilities shall, unless otherwise
allocated pursuant to this Agreement or a Replacement Contract, be allocated
from time to time between Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may be, based on the relative
proportions of total benefits received (to the extent the Liabilities relate
to a specific period, over such period, and otherwise over the term of the
applicable Backstop Shared Contract, measured up to the date of the
allocation, without duplication) by Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, under the relevant Backstop Shared
Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall be solely
responsible for any and all Liabilities to the extent arising out of or
relating to such Partys (or its Subsidiaries) breach of any such Backstop
Shared Contract. It is acknowledged that for the purposes of this _Section_ __
_ 5.05_ changes in volume metrics, as well as changes to reflect the needs of
the applicable Party, shall not be considered when determining whether
contract rights and obligations are "substantially similar."

Section 5.06 _Third_ _Party_   _Approvals_.

(a) Except with respect to Regulatory Approvals (which are addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_), Permits (which are addressed in _Section_ __ _
5.04_), and the Shared Contracts (which are addressed in _Section_ __ _
5.05_), and the Business Real Property (which is addressed in  _Section_ __ _
5.24_), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller and
Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents, waivers, approvals,
orders and authorizations necessary to transfer and assign the Non-Assignable
Assets (including the Assumed Contracts) (the " _Third Party Approvals_ ")
prior to the Closing. To the extent that any Third Party Approval has not
been obtained prior to Closing, for up to one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, at either Partys request, to endeavor to obtain such
Third Party Approvals. Buyer and Seller shall each bear one half (1/2) of the
costs and expenses of obtaining any such Third Party Approvals; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any
further Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation in connection
therewith;

 



60  provided, further, that Buyer shall be responsible for all ongoing (i.e.,
going forward, including payments due at the time of obtaining any Third Party
Approval intended to cover Buyers and its Subsidiaries going forward costs)
costs or fees required to be paid under a Non-Assignable Asset.

 

(b) In addition, with respect to any Non-Assignable Asset, to the extent
permitted by Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Asset, in the event any
Third Party Approval has not been obtained by Closing, at Buyers request,
Seller or a Retained Subsidiary shall hold in trust for Buyer the relevant
Non-Assignable Asset until such time as the Third Party Approval is obtained,
but in no event longer than one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Closing. During such time period, Seller or a Retained Subsidiary shall
comply with all applicable covenants and obligations under the Non-Assignable
Assets, including the payment of any costs or expenses in connection
therewith, which shall be performed by Seller or a Retained Subsidiary for
Buyers account and Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than thirty
(30) days following receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from Seller
(which invoices shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer on a monthly basis and
shall aggregate all such costs or expenses, together with reasonable
supporting documentation)) reimburse Seller for any out-of-pocket costs,
expenses or payments made by Seller in respect of such Non-Assignable Asset.
For the period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date, to the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable
Asset, Buyer shall be entitled to receive all of the benefits of Seller under
the Non-Assignable Asset. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold the
Seller Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Liabilities based
upon, arising out of or relating to the performance of, or failure to perform,
any obligations under the Non-Assignable Assets that are for the benefit of
Buyer as described in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, except to the extent such
Liabilities arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, following the
Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall renew any Non-Assignable Asset
upon the expiration or termination thereof unless, during the period between
the Closing Date and one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter, Buyer has
a replacement arrangement therefor (which shall be determined in Buyers sole
discretion and communicated to Seller in writing) or Buyer confirms to Seller
in writing that Buyer does not need to receive the benefit of such Non-
Assignable Asset. In addition, to the extent that any Non-Assignable Asset
contains an "evergreen" provision that automatically renews such Non-
Assignable Asset unless terminated or cancelled by either party thereto,
Seller and its Affiliates shall not terminate or cancel such Non-Assignable
Asset unless Buyer has a replacement arrangement therefor (which shall be
determined in Buyers sole discretion and communicated to Seller in writing),
or, during the period between the Closing Date and one hundred eighty (180)
days thereafter, Buyer confirms to Seller in writing that Buyer does not need
to receive the benefit of such Non-Assignable Asset.

 

Section 5.07 _Post-Closing_ _Asset_ _Transfers_. In the event that at any time
or from time to time after the Closing Date, Seller or any of its Retained
Subsidiaries receives or otherwise possesses any Purchased Asset or other
property or asset that should belong to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
Seller shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such asset to
Buyer, for no additional consideration. Prior to any such transfer, Seller
shall hold such property or asset in trust for the benefit of Buyer. In the
event that at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer or
its Affiliates receives or

 



61  otherwise possess any Excluded Asset or other property or asset that should
belong to Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such
property or asset to Seller or the appropriate Retained Subsidiary, for no
additional consideration.

 

Section 5.08 _Reserved_.

 

Section 5.09 _Business_ _Guarantees_. The Parties covenant to comply with
their respective obligations identified on _Schedule 5.09_.

Section 5.10 _Notices_. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall give Seller,
and Seller shall give Buyer, prompt written notice of (i) any known
development that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of a
condition set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_ , and (ii) any material Action
threatened against such Party related to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No delivery of any notice under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall be
deemed to cure any breach or affect any remedies available to a Party
hereunder.

 

Section 5.11 _Intellectual_ _Property_. Prior to the Closing, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the
appropriate Governmental Authority in the United States and each other country
in which Seller and its Subsidiaries own or purport to own Trademarks included
in the Business Intellectual Property and IPCo Intellectual Property,
documents that would be sufficient to establish, once such documents are duly
and timely recorded by the appropriate Governmental Authority, that such
Seller or Subsidiary is the recorded owner of each Trademark.

 

Section 5.12 _Insurance_.

 

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, continue to carry their
respective insurance policies with respect to the Business prior to the
Closing. From and after the Closing Date, the Business shall cease to be
insured by Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies or by any of their
self-insured programs. Seller or its Affiliates may, to be effective at
the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner they deem appropriate
to give effect to this _Section 5.12(a)_. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for
its operation of the Business and for promptly providing evidence thereof, as
may be required, to third parties under any Contract or Lease.

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to assert claims arising
from or relating to facts, circumstances, events or matters that occurred
prior to the Closing and that constitute the Assumed Liabilities under any
applicable insurance policies of Seller or its

 



62  Affiliates in effect on or prior to the Closing Date relating to the
Business, to the extent permitted under such insurance policies and subject to
the applicable deductibles, up to the full available limits of such policies.
Seller hereby authorizes Buyer to report such claims directly to the provider
of such insurance policies; provided that Buyer shall report such claims
simultaneously to Seller. At Buyers request and expense, and subject at all
times to Buyers direction and control, Seller and its Affiliates shall
participate and assist in Buyers efforts to pursue insurance coverage through
litigation or other action against an insurer. Seller and its Affiliates
shall be entitled to copies of all documents and correspondence related to
such claims and to discuss the status of such claims with the provider of the
applicable insurance policies. Buyer shall be entitled to settle or compromise
any claim for which it is seeking insurance coverage in excess of the
deductible under such insurance policies, provided that Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any Liabilities incurred in connection therewith; provided,
further, that Buyers responsibility for such Liabilities shall not limit
Buyers ability to recover against the insurance policies of Seller pursuant
to this _Section 5.12(b)_. Seller and its Affiliates shall have no Liability
to Buyer and its Affiliates whatsoever (except for a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 5.12_ and subject to the limitations set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ ) as a
result of the insurance policies and practices of Seller and its Affiliates as
in effect at any time, including as a result of the level or scope of any
such insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance carrier, the terms and
conditions of any policy, or the adequacy or timeliness of any notice to any
insurance carrier with respect to any claim or potential claim or otherwise.

Section 5.13 _Legal_ _Proceedings;_ _Production_   _of_ _Witnesses;_
_Privileged_ _Matters_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, (i) except to the extent that Buyer is
seeking indemnification, in which case the provisions of _ARTICLE IX_ shall
govern, Buyer shall have exclusive authority and control over the
investigation, prosecution, defense, and appeal of all Actions to the extent
covering or relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, and,
subject to _Section 5.12(b)_ , may settle or compromise, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action, and (ii) Seller shall
have exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution,
defense, and appeal of all Actions referred to in _Section 2.05(k)_ and all
other Actions to the extent covering or relating to the Excluded Assets and
the Excluded Liabilities, and may settle or compromise, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action without the consent of
Buyer; provided that, to the extent any Action retained by Seller relates to
or arises out of, in whole or in part, the Business, Seller shall not settle
or compromise, or consent to any judgment in respect of, such Action without
Buyers consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed), unless in connection therewith Seller obtains a complete and
unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim against
or relating to the Business and Buyer and its Affiliates affected by the
claim, and such settlement or judgment does not contain any admission by, or
sanction or restriction upon the conduct or operation of the Business or Buyer
and its Affiliates (including any settlement or judgment that includes
injunctive or other equitable relief (including involving or relating to a
change in business practices)). Without limiting the foregoing, if any Action
involves both any Assumed Liability and/or any Purchased Asset, on the one
hand, and any Excluded Asset and/or any Excluded Liability, on the other,
then, the Parties and their respective applicable Subsidiaries shall
cooperate in good faith in the investigation,

 



63  prosecution, defense, and appeal of such Action. Furthermore, Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) and Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) shall enter into
a written joint defense agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to such
parties with respect to any Action, including Actions listed on _Schedule
2.05(k)_ , as Buyer or Seller may reasonably request.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other and their respective counsel, including by making available to each
other, upon reasonable written request, their (and their Subsidiaries)
respective officers, directors, employees, and agents for fact finding,
consultation, and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any such
Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in which the
requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the conduct of
the Business or the Retained Businesses, prior to or after the Closing.
Access to such Persons shall be granted during normal business hours at a
location and in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the Business and the Retained Businesses, as applicable. Seller and Buyer
agree to reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, but
excluding officers or employees salaries, incurred by the other Party in
connection with providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.13_.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _ARTICLE VI_ shall
govern with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in
_ARTICLE VI_ is in conflict with _Section 5.13(a)_  or _Section 5.13(b)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, neither Party shall have an obligation to cooperate,
make available personnel or disclose any documents or other information
pursuant to _Section 5.13(a)_ or _Section 5.13(b)_ ,  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_
or _ARTICLE VI_ , if Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in any
Action and such assistance, testimony, documents or other information is
reasonably pertinent thereto; provided, further, that this shall not limit in
any respect any rights a Party may have with respect to discovery or the
production of documents or other information in connection with any
such Action.

(d) The Parties agree that their respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert, or waive any attorney-client and work product
privileges belonging to either Party with respect to the Business and the
Retained Businesses (collectively, " _Privileges_ "), shall be governed by the
provisions of this _Section 5.13(d)_ and _Section 2.03(q)_. With respect to
matters relating to the Retained Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the
Excluded Liabilities, in each case regardless of whether such matters also
relate to the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities, and
with respect to all business records, documents, communications, or other
information (collectively, " _Information_ ") of Seller or any Affiliate
prepared in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, Seller shall have sole authority to determine whether to assert or
waive any Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege against
Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates shall take no action
without the prior written consent of Seller that would reasonably be expected
to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of Seller (other than an action
relating to a dispute between the Parties or any of their Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby).
After the Closing, Buyer shall have sole authority to determine whether to
assert or waive any Privileges with respect to matters relating to the
Business (except for the Excluded Liabilities, Information prepared in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions

 



64  contemplated hereby and thereby, or matters that relate to the Retained
Businesses, the Excluded Assets, or the Excluded Liabilities). However, Buyer
may not assert any such Privileges of Buyer related to pre-Closing advice or
communications relating to the Business against Seller and its Affiliates;
provided, however, that, to the extent any waiver (or failure to assert such
Privilege) would reasonably be expected to result in such Privilege being
waived in connection with any claim by a third party in connection with the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such
reasonable arrangements designed to ensure that such Privilege is not
otherwise waived with respect to such third party, including customary joint
defense agreements or similar arrangements. Seller and its Affiliates shall
take no action after the Closing without the prior written consent of Buyer
that would reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any such
Privileges of Buyer. The rights and obligations created by this _Section
5.13(d)_  shall apply to all Information as to which Seller or its Affiliates
would be entitled to assert or has asserted a Privilege without regard to the
effect, if any, of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Privileged Information_ "). Upon receipt by Seller or its Affiliates, or
Buyer and its Affiliates, as the case may be, of any subpoena, discovery or
other request from any third party that actually or arguably calls for the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information of the other or if Seller
or its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates, as the case may be, obtains
knowledge that any current or former employee of Seller or its Affiliates or
Buyer or its Affiliates, has received any subpoena, discovery or other
request from any third party that actually or arguably calls for the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information of the other Party, such
Party shall promptly notify the other of the existence of the request
and shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review the
Information and to assert any rights it may have under this _Section 5.13(d)_
or otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information. Sellers transfer of any Business Records or other Information
to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and Sellers agreement to permit
Buyer to obtain Information existing prior to the Closing are made in reliance
on the Parties respective agreements, as set forth in this _Section 5.13(d)_
, to maintain the confidentiality of such Information and to take the steps
provided herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or
be asserted by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be. The access to Business
Records and other Information being granted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.02_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_, _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, and _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ and 
_ARTICLE VI_ , the agreement to provide witnesses and individuals pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ and the disclosure to Buyer and Seller of
Privileged Information relating to the Business or the Retained
Businesses pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not be asserted by Seller or Buyer to constitute, or
otherwise be deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or may be
asserted under this _Section 5.13(d)_ or otherwise.

Section 5.14 _Books_ _and_ _Records;_ _Post-Closing_   _Access_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in no event later than
sixty (60) days after Closing, as permitted by Law, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
all Business Records then in the possession of Seller or any Retained
Subsidiary. The foregoing shall be limited by the following specific
provisions:

(i) To the extent any document (other than that stored on electronic media)
can be subdivided without unreasonable effort and at no or nominal cost into
two portions, one of which constitutes a Business Record and the other of
which does not, such document (other than that stored on electronic media)
shall be so subdivided, and the original or copy of the portion of such
document (other than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes a
Business Record shall be provided to Buyer;

 



65 (ii) To the extent that any files or documents constituting Business Records
are mixed together with any documents or files that are not Business Records
in a way that prevents their separation without unreasonable effort and at no
or nominal cost into two portions, Seller shall not be required to perform
such separation unless specifically requested by Buyer and then at Buyers
sole cost and expense; provided, that Seller shall, promptly upon determining
that such separation would involve unreasonable effort or cost, advise Buyer
of the same and afford Buyer the opportunity to determine whether Buyer
wishes to request that Seller perform such separation in accordance with this
clause (ii);

(iii) Seller shall not be required to deliver to Buyer books and records or
portions thereof (i) if such delivery would violate any applicable Law or (ii)
which are subject to confidentiality agreements which would by their terms
prohibit such delivery; provided, however, if requested by Buyer, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek a waiver of such
confidentiality restriction; provided, further, that Seller shall, promptly
upon determining that such delivery would violate applicable Law or any
confidentiality agreement, advise Buyer of the same and afford Buyer the
opportunity to determine whether Buyer wishes to request that Seller seek a
waiver of such confidentiality restriction in accordance with this
clause (iii);

(iv) Seller may refuse to furnish any Information if it believes in good faith
that doing so presents, based on an advice of outside counsel, a significant
risk of loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of legal privilege
or work-product privilege; provided that the Parties shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information without
resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
privilege; and

(v) Seller may redact any Information covered by this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_
as and to the extent such Information relates to the Retained Businesses, the
Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities.

 

(b) Buyer agrees to hold at least one copy of all Business Records (including
all Forms I-9) that constitute Purchased Assets and not to destroy or dispose
of such copy for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or such
longer time as may be required by Law (provided that Buyer shall not be
required to retain Forms I-9 for longer than the periods required by Law), and
if thereafter Buyer proposes to destroy or dispose of such copy, Buyer shall
offer first in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to such
proposed destruction or disposition to surrender all or any portion of such
Business Records to Seller upon Sellers request.

(c) From and after the Closing, except as prohibited by applicable Law, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) give Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance written notice to the offices, properties

or before the Closing Date, (ii) furnish to Seller and its Representatives
such financial and operating data and other information relating to the
Business on or before the Closing Date, and (iii) cause the employees, counsel
and financial advisors of Buyer and its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate
with Seller and its Representatives, in each case, to the extent reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with accounting, Tax and other similar

Seller shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries, to (A) give

relating to the Business on or before the Closing Date, and (C) cause the

each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with

Buyers preparation of audited financial statements of the Business for the
2017 fiscal year). Any such access shall be granted in a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Party granting
such access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may withhold such
access, as and to the extent necessary to avoid contravention or waiver, to
any document or information the disclosure of which could reasonably be
expected to violate any Contract or any Law or would result in the waiver of
any legal privilege or work-product privilege; provided that to the extent
practicable and in accordance with such Contract or Law, and in a manner that
does not result in the waiver of any such privilege, such Party shall make
reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which these restrictions apply; provided, further, that
nothing in this _Section 5.14(c)_ shall limit in any respect any rights any
Party may have with respect to discovery or the production of documents or
other information in connection with any litigation.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _ARTICLE VI_ shall
govern with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in
_ARTICLE VI_ is in conflict with this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_. 

Section 5.15 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
and Retained Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, for a period of the
longer of (a) three (3) years after the Closing Date and (b) until such

the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to any of the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by
the execution of this Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. As soon as reasonably

structure or tax treatment) any 

 



68  nonpublic commercial or financial information and (c) either Party may
disclose confidential information to any financial institution providing
credit to such Party or any of its Affiliates or to any Governmental

dealings, as long as such Governmental Authority or rating agency is advised
of the confidential nature of such information and such Person uses
commercially reasonable efforts to seek confidential treatment of such
information to the extent available. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_
shall be deemed to restrict Buyers ability to monetize its investment in the
Business in compliance with applicable Laws.

this Agreement (the " _Go-Shop Period_"), Seller and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall have the right, directly or
indirectly, to: (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate and encourage (publicly or
otherwise) any inquiry or the making of any proposals or offers that could

non-public information to any Person and its Representatives, its Affiliates
and its prospective equity and debt financing sources pursuant to (but
only pursuant to) a confidentiality agreement that contains terms limiting

in any existing confidentiality agreements) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); provided that (A) Seller shall make available to Buyer
(through an electronic data site or otherwise) concurrently with providing
such information to any such Person(s), any non-public information concerning
the Business that Seller provides to any Person given such access that was
not previously made available to Buyer, (B) shall promptly disclose to Buyer

agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits Seller
from providing any information to Buyer in accordance with this  _Section_ __
_ 5.18_.

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors
shall, and Seller shall cause its Representatives to, (i) at 12:00 midnight
(Eastern time) on the 36th calendar day after the date of this Agreement (the
" _Go-Shop Period End Date_") immediately cease and terminate any
solicitation, encouragement (including by way of providing access to non-

thereafter deliver a written notice to each such Person to the effect that
Seller is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, effective immediately, which notice shall
also request such Person to return or destroy promptly all confidential
information concerning Seller and its Subsidiaries, and Seller shall take all
reasonably necessary actions to secure its rights and ensure the performance
of any such Persons obligations under any applicable Acceptable

under any standstill or confidentiality agreement or any Anti-Takeover Statute

proposals, discussion or negotiations or any effort or attempt by any Person
to make an Acquisition Proposal. A breach by any Representative of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, acting by or on behalf of Seller, of this _Section_
__ _ 5.18_ shall constitute a breach by Seller of this _Section_ __ _
5.18_.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means: any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
(whether or not in writing) from any Person or Group other than Buyer or any
of its Affiliates for, the acquisition, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, directly or indirectly, of the Business, including the

of substantially identical liabilities, in each case related to the
acquisition of the Business as contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to the direct or indirect
acquisition, whether by sale of equity securities, sale of assets, merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or otherwise, relating to any
Retained Business, in whole or in part, or relating to a smaller portion of
the Business than is contemplated hereby or only all or a portion of the Owned
Real Property (including sale-leasebacks or similar financing transactions),
shall not comprise an Acquisition Proposal hereunder.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ and
that Sellers Board of Directors has determined in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, is
(i) reasonably likely to be, and reasonably capable of being, consummated in
accordance with its terms, and, (ii) if consummated, would be more favorable
to Seller than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taken as a
whole (including changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed in response to such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise by Buyer that,
if accepted by Seller, would be binding upon Buyer), taking into account (a)
all financial considerations (including financing terms and
conditionality related

 



71  thereto), (b) the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
(c) the anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of such
Acquisition Proposal, (d) the other terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal and the implications thereof on Seller, including all relevant legal,
regulatory and financial aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, and the Person
making the proposal and (e) any other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
deemed relevant by Sellers Board of Directors.

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.18(d)_ , Sellers Board of
Directors shall not approve or recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to

enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
pursuant to _Section 5.18(a)_ ) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 35th calendar day after the
date of this Agreement, so long as none of Seller, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives has breached in any material respect this _Section_ __ _
5.18_, and the Seller and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with their obligations under _Section 5.18(f)_ , Sellers Board of
Directors may, if Sellers Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, subject to prior or concurrent payment of the
Termination Fee and Buyer Expenses, terminate this Agreement under _Section_
__ _ 10.01_ if Sellers Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that the
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement is a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the 35-day period
set forth in this _Section 5.18(d)_ shall automatically extend to the date
that any Notice Period with respect to a Superior Proposal expires in
accordance with _Section 5.18(f)_ solely to the extent that such Notice Period
began at or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 35th calendar day after
the date of this Agreement; provided, further, for the avoidance of doubt, the
35-day period set forth in this _Section 5.18_ (d) may not be extended past
11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 39th calendar day after the date of this
Agreement unless any amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Buyer pursuant to _Section 5.18(f)_ are received by Seller after
5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on such 39th day, in which case the period set forth
in this _Section 5.18(d)_ shall extend to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the
next calendar day.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ shall be deemed to
prohibit Seller or Sellers Board of Directors from complying with its
disclosure obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that this _Section 5.18(e)_ shall not
permit Sellers Board of Directors to take any other actions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, except, in each case, to the extent expressly
permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this _Section_ __ _
5.18_.

 

(f) Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement under _Section_
__ _ 10.01_ unless (i) Seller has provided a written notice to Buyer at
least four (4) calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), which
notice in the case of a Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_
") shall specify that Seller intends to take such action and include copies
of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal (including copies
of the then-current form of acquisition agreement, together with copies of any
commitment letters or similar material 

 



72  documents with respect to any financing for such Superior Proposal), or if
either the Superior Proposal or financing terms were not made in writing, a
description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal or
financing, as applicable, that is the basis of such action (including the
identity of the Person making such proposal); (ii) if requested by Buyer,
Seller shall, and shall cause its financial advisor and outside counsel to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Buyer and its Representatives in good
faith to make amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (iii)
following the end of the Notice Period, Sellers Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside counsel), taking into account any written and complete amendments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Buyer that,
if accepted by Seller, would be binding upon Seller in response to the Notice
of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to
the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.
In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal, Seller
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Buyer and to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.18(f)_ with respect to such new written
notice.

 

Section 5.19 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange the Financing as promptly as practicable following the

including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Financing to be
consummated upon satisfaction of the Financing Conditions contained in the

any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition
(including any of the Financing Conditions) or other provision or remedy under
the Equity Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of Seller
(which may be granted or withheld in Sellers sole discretion), to the extent
such amendments, modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate
amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the Financing, or (ii) impose
new or additional conditions precedent or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the Financing Conditions or other terms therein in a manner adverse to
Buyer or Seller, including any expansion, waiver, amendment or modification
that would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability
of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, (B) adversely impact the ability of Seller or
Buyer to enforce its rights or remedies against the Equity Investors or (C)
make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the Financing
Conditions any less likely to occur. Buyer shall promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) notify Seller of (i) any amendment, waiver or
modification, or agreement to do any of the foregoing, of any term of the
Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) the expiration or termination (or attempted or
purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Equity Commitment Letter,
or (iii) any refusal by any of the Equity Investors to provide, any stated
intent by any of the Equity Investors to refuse to provide, or any expression
of concern or reservation by any of the Equity Investors regarding
its obligation and/or ability to provide, the full financing contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter.

 



73 (b) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, provide such

and (y) to the extent necessary for the valid and enforceable execution of
the definitive documents for the Debt Financing, such action as is reasonably
necessary to facilitate the adoption of resolutions and consents, as
applicable) or (F) take any action that will conflict with or violate
Sellers or any of its Affiliates Organizational Documents or any Law or
result in the material contravention of, or that would reasonably be expect to
result in a material violation or breach of, or default any, any material
Contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party; provided that
the foregoing clause (E) shall not prevent any of the officers or directors of
the Business who will remain officers and/or 

 



75  directors of the Business immediately following the Closing from executing
documents, agreements, resolutions, certificates and instruments that do not
become effective until the Closing.

 

(d) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, and
each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred
in connection with the arrangement of any debt financing or any assistance or
any activities provided in connection therewith (other than historical

writing for the purpose of arranging any debt financing); provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply in the event of Sellers or its Affiliates

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS 

Section 6.01 _Transfer_ _Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, all sales, use, registration, stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, property, transfer, gains and similar Taxes, levies, charges and
fees (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne and paid one-half (1/2) by
Buyer and one-half (1/2) by Seller when due, and the party required by
applicable Law shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.02 _Property_ _Taxes_ _for_   _Straddle_ _Tax_ _Periods_. Except to
the extent Property Taxes levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for the
Straddle Tax Period (and all reasonable contingent expenses paid to
consultants for appealing such Property Taxes) are Assumed Liabilities, such
Property Taxes (" _Non-Assumed Property_ _Taxes_ ")

 



77  shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days of
such Straddle Tax Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
number of days of such Straddle Tax Period included in the Post-Closing Tax
Period. Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Non-
Assumed Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
shall receive any refunds actually received that are attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
such Non-Assumed Property Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax
Period and shall receive any refunds that are attributable to the Post-Closing
Tax Period. Within ten (10) days after the end of each quarter following the
Closing Date, each of Buyer and Seller shall present a statement to the other
Party setting forth any Non-Assumed Property Tax bills for a Straddle Tax
Period received by such Party during the quarter, the amount of reasonable
contingent expenses (if any) incurred in appealing such Non-Assumed Property
Taxes and a calculation of the amount of reimbursement to which each Party is
entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ for the quarter, taking into account
payments for Non-Assumed Property Taxes made by Seller prior to Closing,
together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the
Party owing it to the other Party within ten (10) days after delivery of such
statement. In the event that Buyer or Seller is entitled to reimbursement for
an amount paid under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the applicable Party shall
make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten (10) days
after the presentation of a quarterly statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the presenting Party is entitled along with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement. To the extent either Party or an Affiliate thereof receives a
refund of Non-Assumed Property Taxes for a Straddle Tax Period with respect to
any Purchased Assets, such Party shall promptly present a statement to the
other Party setting forth the amount of the refund to which each Party is
entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the amount of reasonable contingent
expenses (if any) incurred in appealing such Non-Assumed Property Taxes (to
the extent not previously taken into account above), and such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The
proration amount shall be paid by the Party owing it to the other Party within
ten (10) days after delivery of such statement. For the sake of clarity, this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_ applies only to Property Taxes that are not Assumed
Liabilities.

 

Section 6.03 _Cooperation_ _On_ _Tax_ _Matters_. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate fully, and Buyer and Seller shall each cause each of its Affiliates
to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested in writing by
the other Party, in connection with any audit, examination, inquiry, claim for
refund, lawsuit, Action, claim, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding at
Law or in equity by or before a Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes
relating to the Purchased Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Tax Period (each a " _Tax Claim_ "). Such cooperation shall include
access to records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Return or Tax Claim, making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder and executing powers of attorney. Seller and Buyer shall,
and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to (a) retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Business and the Purchased Assets
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period for six (6) years following the Closing
Date and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority, and (b) to give the other Party reasonable notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other

 



78  Party so requests, Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause its
Affiliates to, allow the other Party, at such other Partys expense, to take
possession of such books and records. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to transfer to Buyer
any Tax Returns or other Tax work papers of Seller or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries; provided that Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of any such
Tax Returns that relate primarily to the Business or the Purchased Assets.
Buyer and Seller each agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax (including any Transfer Taxes) that could be imposed, including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
Seller or one of its Affiliates is required by applicable Law to file the Tax
Return in respect of Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period
that is an Assumed Liability, Seller shall provide a draft of such Tax Return
as soon as practicable for Buyers review, comment and approval prior to the
filing thereof. Seller shall make such changes to such Tax Return as
reasonably requested by Buyer.

 

Section 6.04 _Tax_ _Claims_.

 

(a) If any Party receives a notice of a Tax Claim relating to the Purchased
Assets which could reasonably impact the Taxes or Tax position of the Party
not receiving such notice, the Party receiving notice of such a Tax Claim
shall notify the other party within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice;
provided, that the failure to timely provide such notice shall not affect the
right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

 

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim solely relating to Taxes for a Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and that are Taxes that constitute
Excluded Liabilities or for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer,
Seller shall have control of the conduct and defense of such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel) at its own expense; provided, however, that
Buyer shall be able to participate, at its own expense, in the conduct and
defense of any Tax Claim. With respect to Tax Claims relating to Taxes for
Straddle Tax Periods and that are Taxes that constitute Excluded Liabilities
or for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly control such Tax Claim. A Party shall promptly notify the other Party
if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim which
it is entitled to control pursuant to this _Section 6.04(b)_ and the other
Party shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such Tax Claim at its
own expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.04(b)_ , the Party controlling any Tax Claim relating to Income Taxes for a
Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or for a Straddle Tax Period
shall not settle such Tax Claim without the other Partys prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have control of the conduct, defense
and resolution of any Tax Claim relating to Taxes that are Assumed Liabilities
and for which Seller does not have an indemnity obligation to Buyer.

 



79 Section 6.05 _Post-Closing_ _Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be liable for (a) any Taxes
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent attributable
to (i) a breach of a representation contained in  _Section_ __ _ 3.19_
(Taxes), (ii) any Liability of Seller described in _Section 2.05(h)(i)_ or
_(iii)_ a breach of any other covenant contained in this Agreement), or (b)
any Taxes attributable to or resulting from any action of Buyer after the
Closing on the Closing Date which is outside the ordinary course of business
of the Business (except to the extent such actions are taken pursuant to an
agreement with respect to the Business entered into prior to Closing);
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.05_ shall limit the Buyer Indemnitees ability to be indemnified for any
Excluded Liabilities (including with respect to Taxes) pursuant to  _Section
9.02(a)(v)_.

Section 6.06 _Powers_ _of_ _Attorney_. All powers of attorney that relate in
any way to the Purchased Assets will be terminated prior to the Closing and,
after the Closing, no such power of attorney will have any effect on the
Purchased Assets.

 

Section 6.07 _Overlap_ _Provisions_. In the event of any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this  _ARTICLE VI_ and _ARTICLE IX_, the
provisions of this _ARTICLE VI_ shall control.

ARTICLE VII

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 7.01 _Employees_.

 

(a) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) make an offer of
employment (an " _Offer_ ") to each Business Employee, effective as of the
Closing Date and subject to such Business Employee remaining actively employed
through the Closing Date. Such Offers shall be for a reasonably comparable
position as compared to the position held immediately prior to the
Closing Date and shall be on the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.02_. For this purpose, a Business Employee will be
considered "actively employed" if, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
such employee is either actively at work or absent from work on account of
paid time-off, vacation, sick leave or similar temporary absence, but will not
be "actively employed" if such individual is not actively at work due to any
other reason. For restaurant-based Business Employees, such Offers may be
provided in the form of a "welcome letter" or similar communication. For all
other Business Employees, such Offers shall be provided in writing no less
than seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date in the form of an individual
confirmation of employment transfer notice prepared by Buyer. Buyer will
provide Seller with a draft sample confirmation of employment transfer notice
a reasonable period of time prior to such notice being provided and will
reasonably consider any comments provided by Seller. Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with any information concerning the
Business Employees that is reasonably requested by Buyer in order to make the
Offers required under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, unless prohibited by
applicable Law. Unless a written acceptance of an offer of employment
is required by Law (including in connection with _Section 7.02(g)_),

 



80  any Business Employee who (i) has received such an Offer in the applicable
form described above, (ii) remains actively employed through the Closing Date,
(iii) has not specifically declined such offer, and (iv) actually commences
employment with Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary on the Closing Date (or his
or her first regularly-scheduled day of employment following the Closing Date
or in the event of an un-scheduled absence from work, reasonably promptly
thereafter) shall be deemed (A) to have accepted such offer and (B) to have
terminated employment with Seller on the Closing Date. Until the
Closing Date, Buyer shall keep Seller informed of any rejections of such
Offers in a timely manner. Seller and its Subsidiaries acknowledge and agree
that they shall neither enforce, nor treat the continued employment of any
Transferred Employee by the Business following the Transfer Time as a
violation of any non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality
obligation owed by any Transferred Employee to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not constitute a
waiver of any of Sellers rights under _Section_ __ _ 5.17_.

 

(b) With respect to any Business Employee who is not actively employed as of
the Closing Date (each an " _Inactive Employee_ ") but presents himself or
herself for commencement of active employment within six (6) months of Closing
or such later date with respect to which such Business Employee has a legal
right for reemployment, reinstatement or reactivation, Buyer shall offer
employment to each such Inactive Employee effective on the first date such
Inactive Employee returns to work. Buyer acknowledges that the terms of
reemployment, reinstatement or reactivation of an Inactive Employee who is on
approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended,
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as
amended, or any similar Law relating to reemployment, reinstatement or
reactivation rights for employees on leave of absence immediately prior to
the Closing Date shall be governed by such Laws.

(c) Business Employees who accept (or are deemed to have accepted, as
applicable) an Offer and who commence employment with Buyer (or a Subsidiary
of Buyer) are collectively referred to herein as the " _Transferred Employees_
"; provided that Inactive Employees shall not be considered a Transferred
Employee until such Inactive Employee actually commences active employment
with Buyer (or a Subsidiary of Buyer).

(d) Buyer shall provide any notices to the Transferred Employees that may be
required under any applicable Law, including the WARN Act or any similar Law,
with respect to events that occur after the Closing and Buyer shall not take
any action within the first ninety (90) days after the Closing that would
cause any termination of employment of any employees by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries that occurs on or before the Closing to constitute a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" under the WARN Act or any similar Law, without
Buyer satisfying all resultant Liabilities that arise under the WARN Act or
any similar Law; provided that, promptly following a reasonable request
therefor, Seller shall provide Buyer with such information as is reasonably
necessary to allow Buyer to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
7.01(d)_.

 



81 Section 7.02 _Compensation_ _and_ _Benefits_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date (the " _Relevant Period_ "), it shall provide (or cause its Subsidiaries
to provide) each Transferred Employee with (i) an annual base salary or wage
rate that is the same as or greater than his or her annual base salary or wage
rate in effect immediately prior to the Closing (as adjusted to reflect
salary increases to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as set forth on _Schedule 5.01(p)(iii)_ ), and (ii) annual
cash incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially similar in
the aggregate as compared to his or her ordinary course target annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities in effect immediately prior to the date
of this Agreement (or the Transferred Employees date of hire, if later),
it being understood that such annual incentive compensation need not be
provided by Buyer to the Transferred Employees in the form of equity or
equity-based awards and that Buyer will have discretion to determine the
relevant performance goals. Following the date of this Agreement, if
requested by Buyer, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to determine
with respect to each Transferred Employee the amount of value required to be
provided by Buyer pursuant to the foregoing commitment. In addition, Buyer
agrees that, during the Relevant Period, it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) Transferred
Employees benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to those
provided to such employees under the Employee Plans set forth on _Schedule
3.16(a)_ immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, except for the Employee Plans set forth on _Schedule 7.04(a)_ , in
no event shall any Employee Plan, or the sponsorship of any Employee Plan, be
transferred to, or assumed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates as a result of or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer shall grant (or cause its Subsidiaries to grant) each Transferred
Employee credit for years of prior service with Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective predecessors for eligibility and vesting
purposes under each employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA) sponsored or maintained by Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries, and for the purposes of determining future accrued
vacation or paid time off or severance amounts, to the same extent such
service was recognized for similar purposes under the Employee Plans prior to
the Closing; provided, however, that such credit shall not result in a
duplication of benefits. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate and exchange such
information as is necessary to avoid any such duplication of benefits.

 

(c) As of 12:01 a.m. U.S. eastern time on the Closing Date, or, with respect
to any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee, the time of
commencement of employment with Buyer or its Subsidiaries (the " _Transfer
Time_ "), each Transferred Employee participating in any Employee Plan that is
a health and welfare benefit plan (each, a " _Seller Welfare Plan_ ") shall
cease to be eligible to participate in such Seller Welfare Plans and Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit such Transferred Employee
to immediately commence participation in health and welfare benefit
plans that shall be maintained, administered or contributed to, as
applicable, as of the Transfer Time or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter by Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Seller shall be responsible for
claims incurred under each Seller Welfare Plan (in accordance with such plan)
for Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents prior to the
Transfer Time. All health and welfare benefit claims incurred for Transferred
Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents under the welfare plans
sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates (the " _Buyer Welfare Plans_ ") at or
after the Transfer Time shall be the responsibility of Buyer and its
Affiliates. For

 



82  purposes of this _Section 7.02(c)_ , claims shall be deemed to be incurred
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Seller Welfare Plans. Prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
as Buyer may request to facilitate and support the establishment of the Buyer
Welfare Plans, including, as requested, using commercially reasonable efforts
to provide access to and to negotiate with the current vendors or suppliers
of or to the Seller Welfare Plans and to support the preparation, as
necessary, of plan documents and related materials for the Buyer Welfare Plans
that are substantially similar to the existing Seller Welfare Plans. 

(d) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any health
and welfare plans in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing to the extent that such limitations were waived
or satisfied or did not apply under the applicable Seller Welfare Plan; and
(ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid in the plan year prior to the Transfer Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any health benefit
plans in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate after
the Closing Date.

(e) Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) have in effect Buyer
Welfare Plans that are medical and dependent care flexible spending account
plans (the " _Buyer FSA Plans_ ") that will provide benefits to Transferred
Employees who participate in Sellers medical and dependent care flexible
spending account plans as of immediately prior to the Transfer Time (the "
_Seller FSA Plans_ "). For the remainder of the plan year in which the
Transfer Time occurs, each Transferred Employee shall continue to have
payroll deductions made as most recently elected by him or her under the
applicable Seller FSA Plan. On and after the Transfer Time, Buyer shall assume
and be solely responsible for all eligible claims for reimbursement by
Transferred Employees for claims incurred during the current plan year,
whether incurred prior to, on or after the Transfer Time, that have not been
paid in full as of the Transfer Time, which claims shall be paid pursuant to
and under the terms of the Buyer FSA Plans. _Schedule 7.02(e)_ sets forth, as
of no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement,
the aggregate FSA account balances of the Business Employees. Following the
Closing, Seller will provide Buyer with such information, including the FSA
account balance so transferred, FSA claims previously paid during the current
plan year and payroll deduction elections, as may be reasonably necessary for
Buyer to comply with this _Section 7.02(e)_. This _Section 7.02(e)_ shall be
interpreted and administered in a manner consistent with Rev. Rul. 2002-32.

 

(f) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide severance
benefits to any Transferred Employee, other than any employee set forth on
_Schedule 7.02(f)(ii)_ who is laid off or whose employment is otherwise
involuntarily terminated by Buyer or its Subsidiaries without cause during the
Severance Protection Period in an amount that is equal to or greater than
the severance benefits (including severance payments and continued health
coverage) as set forth on _Schedule 7.02(f)(_ _i_ _)_ or (ii) solely with
respect to the employees set forth on _Schedule 7.02(f)(ii)_ (if they
become Transferred Employees), unless such employees consent to receive
severance provided under employment agreements that supersede the payment of
severance pursuant to this paragraph and Seller is a beneficiary of releases
under such 

 



83  employment agreements that are reasonably satisfactory to Seller (with
Sellers approval not to be unreasonably withheld), provide severance benefits
equal to or greater than the severance payments set forth on _Schedule
7.02(f)(ii)_ upon a termination without "Cause" or resignation for "Good
Reason" as defined on _Schedule 7.02(f)(ii)_ (provided that such definition of
Good Reason shall not apply to or be triggered by any changes in the terms
and conditions of any Transferred Employees employment effected in connection
with Buyers hiring or employment of such Transferred Employee in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including that such
Transferred Employee will no longer be employed by a publicly-held company and
will no longer have duties, budgetary or other authority and responsibilities
with respect to multiple business segments or divisions) and that the
transfer of the Transferred Employees employment in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be treated as a
termination without "Cause" for any purpose) during the Severance
Protection Period; provided, further, that in no event shall Buyer or its
Subsidiaries be obligated to provide any severance benefits in violation of
applicable Law. For purposes of the foregoing, " _Severance Protection Period_
" means (i) with respect to the employees set forth on _Schedule 7.02(f)(ii)_
, 12 months or 24 months (as indicated on _Schedule 7.02(f)(ii)_ ) following
the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to all other Transferred Employees,
the Relevant Period.

(g) Buyer shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation
benefits that are incurred prior to or after the Transfer Time by any current
or former employee primarily dedicated to the performance of services for the
Business, including any Business Employee.

 

Section 7.03 _Vacation_ _and_ _Other_ _Paid_ _Time_ _Off_. Buyer (or its
Subsidiary) shall assume any accrued but unused vacation or other paid-time
off (" _PTO_ ") as of the Transfer Time for each Transferred Employee,
provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to (i)
hourly Transferred Employees in the jurisdictions identified on _Schedule
7.03_ and (ii) salaried Transferred Employees in the jurisdictions identified
on _Schedule 7.03_ who do not consent to the transfer of PTO to Buyer (or
its Subsidiaries) as a condition of their Offer. Following the Closing,
Seller shall provide Buyer with such information, including PTO balances,
within Sellers possession or control as may be necessary for Buyer to comply
with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_. For such Transferred
Employees in the jurisdictions identified on _Schedule 7.03_ , Buyer shall be
responsible for all PTO that is accrued as of the Transfer Time and shall pay
such Transferred Employees their PTO account balances as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing and within the time periods required by Law.

 

Section 7.04 _Accrued_ _Compensation_. Buyer shall assume all Liabilities to
pay all Transferred Employees all base wages and base salaries (including,
withholding obligations and payroll taxes with respect thereto) earned or
accrued and unpaid through the Transfer Time that would be required to be
accrued as a current liability on a balance sheet of the Business prepared in
accordance with GAAP as of immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall pay
such Transferred Employees all such earned or accrued compensation in
accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Business as in effect
prior to the Closing and within the time periods required by Law. Buyer will
assume all obligations to

 



84  each Transferred Employee pursuant to any annual or other short-term cash
incentive or bonus Employee Plan set forth on _Schedule 7.04_ covering such
Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date. Consistent with Buyers
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, pay the Transferred Employees such incentive compensation on
the same basis as in effect prior to the Closing Date for the applicable
performance measurement period which includes the Closing Date. As of the
Closing, Buyer will assume, with respect to each Transferred Employee, all
obligations with respect to tuition reimbursement or similar benefits for all
in-process or completed courses not yet reimbursed by Seller and will pay such
benefits to the applicable Transferred Employee in a manner consistent with
the terms of the corresponding Employee Plan. Following the Closing, Seller
shall provide such information, including current accruals for such wages,
salaries, bonuses, incentive compensation and tuition reimbursement, within
Sellers possession or control as may be necessary for Buyer to comply with
its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_. Except as expressly set
forth in this Section 7.04, Seller shall retain all Liabilities to pay
Transferred Employees all wages or other compensation earned or accrued on or
prior to the Transfer Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, all
compensation earned or accrued under any Employee Plans (including any equity
or deferred compensation plan) and all withholding obligations and payroll
taxes with respect to such retained Liabilities.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.01 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Parties and
all covenants and agreements which by their terms are to be performed at or
prior to the Closing contained in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered by any of the Parties at Closing shall survive the Closing for a
period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date; provided that: (x) the
representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ (Employee
Benefit Plans), the last sentence of _Section 3.18(a)_ (Employees) and
_Section_ __ _ 3.19_ (Taxes), shall survive until sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; (y) the representations
and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.17_ (Environmental Compliance)

__ _ 4.02_ (Corporate Authorization) and _Section_ __ _ 4.08_ (Finders
Fees) shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations period. All of
the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their nature are required to
be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing until fully
performed or fulfilled, unless and to the extent only that non-compliance with
such covenants or agreements is waived in writing by the Party entitled to
such performance. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any breach or
inaccuracy of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect
of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time
at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two
sentences, if written notice in accordance with the requirements set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_ of the breach or inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such
right of indemnity shall have been given to the Party against whom such
indemnity may be sought prior to such time. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that with respect to any claim that any Party may have against any other Party
that is permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the survival
periods set forth and agreed to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ shall govern
when any such claim may be brought and, except in the case of clause (x) and
(y) of the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, shall replace and
supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be applicable.

 

Section 9.02 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ , effective at and after
the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer_ _Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each
of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee arising out of or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in  _ARTICLE III_
of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the Transition
Services Agreement, the IPCo LLC Agreement, the Seller Trademark License
Agreement and the Supply Agreement) or any such representation or
warranty being untrue or inaccurate as of the Closing Date (as if remade in
haec verba on the Closing Date, except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such date);

 



88 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the
Transition Services Agreement, the IPCo LLC Agreement, the Seller Trademark
License Agreement and the Supply Agreement);

 

(iii) (A) any and all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Purchased
Assets or the Business for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, other than Taxes
expressly assumed by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.04(d)_ , or (B) the
Sellers portion of any Transfer Taxes under  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_;

(iv) Liabilities arising from any third party claim by any landlord party to
any Lease or the counterparty to any Assumed Contract of breach or default
under such Lease or Assumed Contract by Seller as a result of the assignment
of such Lease or Assumed Contract in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the consent of such
landlord or counterparty in accordance with the terms hereof; or

(v) without duplication, any Excluded Liability;

provided that (A) with respect to indemnification by Seller pursuant to
_Section 9.02(a)(i)_ , Seller shall not be liable for any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller (1) attributable to a single course of
conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of
Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach exceeds
$50,000 (the " _Seller Mini-Basket_ ") and (2) unless the aggregate amount of
Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for all such breaches exceeds
$2,250,000 (the " _Seller Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such
aggregate Damages exceed such amount; and (B) in no event shall Sellers
aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ and/or
_Section 9.02(a)(iv)_ exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Seller Cap_ "), provided,
further, that neither the Seller Mini-Basket, the Seller Deductible nor the
Seller Cap shall apply to any single item, or group of related items, that
results in Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees arising out of
or relating to (X) the breach of any Fundamental Representation or (Y) the
breach of any representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.13(a)_
and _Section_ __ _ 3.19_ (Taxes), which, in each case, the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to recover in their entirety; provided, further, that
neither the Seller Mini-Basket nor the Seller Deductible shall apply to any
single item, or group of related items, that results in Damages incurred by
the Buyer Indemnitees arising out of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.13(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that any
Damages constitute, or otherwise arise out of or relate to, an Assumed
Liability shall not limit the rights of any Buyer Indemnitee to
indemnification under this _Section 9.02(a)_.

 



89 (b) Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ , effective at and after
the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller_ _Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each
of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnitee arising out of or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document (other than the Transition Services
Agreement, the IPCo LLC Agreement, the Buyer Trademark License Agreement and
the Supply Agreement);

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the
Transition Services Agreement, the IPCo LLC Agreement, the Buyer Trademark
License Agreement and the Supply Agreement); or

 

(iii) without duplication, any Assumed Liability;

 

provided that (A) with respect to indemnification by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.02(b)(i)_ , Buyer shall not be liable for any breach of
any representation or warranty of Buyer (1) attributable to a single course
of conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount
of Damages actually incurred by the Seller Indemnitees for such breach exceeds
$50,000 and (2) unless the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by the Seller
Indemnitees for all such breaches exceeds $2,250,000 (the " _Buyer Deductible_
"), and then only to the extent such aggregate Damages exceed such amount;
and (B) in no event shall Buyers aggregate Liability arising out of or
relating to _Section 9.02(b)(i)_ exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Buyer Cap_ "),
provided, further, that neither the Buyer Deductible nor the Buyer Cap
shall apply to any single item, or group of related items, that results in
Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnitees arising out of or relating to the
breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __
_ 4.01_ (Corporate Existence and Power), _Section_ __ _ 4.02_ (Corporate
Authorization) and _Section_ __ _ 4.08_ (Finders Fees), which, in each case,
the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover in their entirety. For
the avoidance of doubt, the fact that any Damages constitute, or otherwise
arise out of or relate to, any Excluded Liability shall not limit the rights
of any Seller Indemnitee to indemnification under this _Section 9.02(b)_.

 

(c) For purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and for
computing the dollar amount of any claim for indemnification resulting from a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, all
materiality, material adverse effect and similar qualifications shall be
disregarded.

 

Section 9.03 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming indemnification under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim
asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_
") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification hereunder shall
promptly notify in writing (such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ ") the

 



90  other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim within
thirty (30) days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Third Party Claim, which Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail
the nature of the Third Party Claim, including the basis of the Indemnified
Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement and the amount of the
Damages arising or estimated to arise therefrom (if available); provided that
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, failure to timely provide such Claim Notice
shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim at any time and, subject to the limitations
contained in this _Section 9.03(b)_ , assume and control the defense thereof.
If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume and control the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
that such Third Party Claim is an indemnifiable Damage under this _ARTICLE IX_
, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party in all appropriate
proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 9.03(b)_. The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or control
such defense and proceedings if such Third Party Claim seeks equitable or
other non-monetary relief (including any sanction or restriction upon the
conduct or operation of any business of the Indemnified Party) or if the
Third Party Claim alleges conduct that would constitute criminal activity, the
Third Party Claim relates to Taxes, or if the resolution of such Third Party
Claim in a manner adverse to the Indemnified Party could result in Damages to
the Indemnified Party in excess of the amount claimed or expected to be
received from the Indemnifying Party (other than as a result of the Buyer
Deductible or the Seller Deductible or any per claim basket), and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the
claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement
agreement does not contain any admission by, or sanction or restriction upon
the conduct or operation of any business by, the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates, including any injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 9.03(b)_ , and
the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation unless (i) the employment of separate legal counsel has
been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) there
exists a material conflict of interest, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails
to pursue the defense of such Third Party Claim actively and diligently, in
the cause of clause (ii) or (iii), whereupon the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to retain the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 9.03(b)_ within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of any Claim
Notice or is not otherwise entitled to

 



91  defend such Third Party Claim, then subject to _Section 9.03(b)_ the
Indemnified Party shall defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and
expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to
indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party, in all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In
such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party
Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to
be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying
Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement
controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9.03(c)_ , and
the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation.

 

(d) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including providing
access to documents, records and information. In addition, the Indemnified
Party will make its personnel available at no cost to the Indemnifying Party
for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party also agrees
to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third
Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and executing powers of
attorney to the extent necessary unless doing so would materially impair the
conduct of the business conducted by the Indemnified Party.

 

(e) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by notice to the Indemnifying Party, which notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, the basis of the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement and the
amount of the Damages estimated to arise therefrom (to the extent
reasonably estimable). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, failure to timely
provide such notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(f) With respect to any claim that any Buyer Indemnitee may assert for
indemnification with respect to any Damages incurred for any environmental
investigation, monitoring, remediation, or other response or removal action ("
_Environmental Response_ ") relating to the Business Real Property, Seller
shall have no indemnification obligations under this Agreement for any
Environmental Response to the extent such Damages result from any intrusive
subsurface investigation by any Buyer Indemnitee, except for such
investigation that is (i) required by Environmental Laws, a Permit or a
Governmental Authority, (ii) conducted to investigate conditions that suggest
an imminent and significant threat to human health or the environment, (iii)
conducted for the purposes of bona fide construction or expansion of
a building or other facility improvement or repair, or (iv) expressly or
affirmatively required at any Leased Real Property pursuant to any Lease or by
any prospective buyer in connection with the bona fide sale of such Leased
Real Property or any Owned Real Property.

 



92 Section 9.04 _Calculation_ _of_ _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein:

(a) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent a
Liability or reserve relating to the matter giving rise to such Damages has
been included in the final determination of the Closing Date Indebtedness or
the Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.09(c)_ ;

 

(b) each Indemnified Party shall take reasonably prudent steps consistent with
customary business practices to mitigate any Damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby after
becoming actually aware of the incurrence of such Damages;

 

(c) the amount of any Damage for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement: (i) shall be reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually received from third party insurers with respect to such
Damage; (ii) shall be reduced by any reduction in Taxes actually paid (or any
increase in any Tax refund actually received) by the Indemnified Party as a
result of the incurrence or payment of such Damage in the taxable year of the
incurrence or payment of such Damage, in any prior taxable year or in the next
succeeding taxable year following the incurrence or payment of such Damage;
and (iii) shall be reduced by indemnification or reimbursement payments
actually received from third parties with respect to such Damage, net, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, of any reasonable costs associated
with the recovery of such amounts. In the event any Indemnified Party
actually recovers any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-
party recoveries in respect of any Damages, in each case at any time
subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ ,
such Indemnified Party shall thereafter promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any indemnity payment made up to the amount actually received by the
Indemnified Party (net of any costs, fees or expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount);

(d) in the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Damages in respect of a
claim of indemnification under this _ARTICLE IX_, no other Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover the same Damages in respect of such claim for
indemnification such that there will be no "double recovery" of Damages in
respect of the same claim; 

(e) except with respect to those actually awarded and paid on account of a
Third Party Claim, no Party shall be liable for punitive or exemplary
damages, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or
otherwise and whether or not arising from any other Partys sole, joint or
concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault;

 

(f) the amount of any Damage for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall not include the costs
of compliance with any equitable remedies resulting from any Action subject
to the indemnification hereunder, including the costs of compliance with any
prospective injunctive relief or the associated need to change the relevant
business practices on a going-forward basis except to the extent such
remedies have been consented to by the Indemnified Party in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed;

 



93 (g) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_ARTICLE IX_ , to sue for, or to assert any other right or remedy with
respect to, any Damages, causes of action or other claims to the extent they
are possible or potential Damages, causes of action or claims that such party
believes may be asserted rather than Damages, causes of action or claims that
have, in fact, been filed of record against such Indemnified Party or paid or
incurred by such Indemnified Party; and

 

(h) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto and the Indemnified Parties hereby
waive to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law the remedy of
rescission.

Section 9.05 _Assignment_   _of_ _Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and the Indemnified Party would have recovered all or a
part of such Damages from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based
on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law and any pertinent
Contract, assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; provided that the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to assign any right to proceed
against a Potential Contributor if the Indemnified Party determined in its
reasonable discretion that such assignment would be materially detrimental to
its business, reputation or future business prospects.

 

Section 9.06 _Treatment_ _of_ _Indemnification_ _Payments_. Any payment made
pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under this _ARTICLE IX_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent
allowable under applicable Law, including for Tax purposes.

 

Section 9.07 _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, except in the case of fraud,
the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims, Damages or other
matters arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents (other than the Transition Services Agreement, the IPCo LLC
Agreement, the Buyer Trademark License Agreement, the Seller
Trademark License Agreement and the Supply Agreement) or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be the rights of indemnification set
forth in this _ARTICLE IX_ only, and no Person will have any other
entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort, strict liability,
equitable remedy or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other
remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law. This  _ARTICLE IX_ will not
operate to interfere with or impede the operation of the covenants contained
in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the
Closing, with respect to a Partys right to seek equitable remedies
(including specific performance or injunctive relief) or the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.09_. The provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ , together with the
covenants

 



94  contained in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be
performed after the Closing, were specifically bargained-for between Seller
and Buyer and were taken into account by Seller and Buyer in arriving at the
Purchase Price. Each of Seller and Buyer, respectively, specifically relied
upon the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ in agreeing to the Purchase Price and
in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties set forth
in _ARTICLE III_ (in the case of Seller) and _ARTICLE IV_ (in the case of
Buyer).

 

Section 9.08 _Additional_ _Agreements_. The Parties covenant to comply with
their respective obligations identified on _Schedule 9.08_.

ARTICLE X

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any other
Action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that this right of
termination shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has
primarily resulted in, such order, decree, ruling, injunction or other
Action;

(c) by Buyer, if there is a breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in _ARTICLE III_ hereof or any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that would cause
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ to be satisfied
on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that, in each case under this
clause (c), Buyer may not terminate this Agreement unless Buyer has given
written notice of such breach to Seller and, with respect to any breach that
is capable of being cured, Seller has not cured such breach within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such notice; provided, that Buyer is not in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement;

 

(d) by Seller, if there is a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in _ARTICLE IV_ hereof or any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that would cause
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ to be satisfied
on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that, in each case under this
clause (d), Seller may not terminate this Agreement unless Seller has given
written notice of such breach to Buyer and, with respect to any breach that is
capable of being cured, Buyer has not cured such breach within thirty (30)
days after receipt of such notice; provided, that Seller is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement;

 



95 (e) by either Buyer or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred on or before
May 31, 2017 (the " _Outside Date_ ") after the date hereof; provided that,
this right of termination shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement has primarily been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur before such date;

(f) by Buyer, if Seller shall have entered into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; or

(g) prior to 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 35th calendar day following the
date of this Agreement (subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 5.18(d)_
), by Seller, if (i) immediately prior to or concurrently with the termination
of this Agreement, Seller, subject to complying with the terms of this
Agreement, enters into one or more Alternative Acquisition Agreements with
respect to a Superior Proposal and (ii) Seller immediately prior to or
concurrently with such termination (or at such later time as required by
_Section_ __ _ 10.03_) pays to Buyer or its designees any fees required to
be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.03_.

Section 10.02 _Effect_ _of_   _Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, without any Liability on the part of any Party hereto;
provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any Party of
Liability for any Damages incurred or suffered by a Party as a result of the
intentional and willful breach of another Party of any obligations required to
be performed by it prior to such termination. The confidentiality provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ and the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_
and _ARTICLE XI_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ thereof) hereof shall
survive any termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, an action for
specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ hereof and/or Section
5 of the Equity Commitment Letter, whether or not successful, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, or arising as a result of the failure of
Buyer to consummate the Closing and to make the payments required by 
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ when required, and Seller and its Affiliates shall not
be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, suit, action or proceeding
against Buyer or its Affiliates, or their respective successors or
permitted assigns arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

 

Section 10.03 _Termination_ _Fee_.

 

(a) Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Termination Fee: 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section 10.01(g)_ ,
in which case payment shall be made prior to or concurrently with such
termination; or

 



96 (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_ ,
in which case payment shall be made within three (3) Business Days following
such termination; or

(iii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)_ and (B) during the period commencing as of immediately following
entry into this Agreement and ending twelve (12) months following such
termination, Seller enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or
otherwise consummates any Qualifying Proposal, then payment of the Termination
Fee shall be made within three (3) Business Days following the date on which
Seller consummates such Qualifying Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Qualifying Proposal_ " shall mean: any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
(whether or not in writing) from any Person or Group other than Buyer or any
of its Affiliates for the acquisition, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, directly or indirectly, of assets comprising at least
50% of the consolidated assets of the Business.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an
amount in cash equal to $15,000,000.

(c) In addition, in the event that Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 10.01(g)_ or Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)_ (whether or not Seller is required to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to  _Section 10.03(a)(iii)_) or _Section 10.01(f)_ , Seller shall
pay Buyer, as promptly as possible (but in any event within five (5) days)
following the delivery by Buyer of an invoice therefor, all the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket third-party costs and expenses incurred by Buyer and
its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Buyer Expenses_ "); _provided_ , that Seller shall not be
required to pay more than an aggregate of $5,000,000 in Buyer Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 10.03(c)_.

 

(d) Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or any other Transaction
Document may only be brought against Persons that are expressly named as
parties hereto or thereto. No former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, members, managers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners
or assignees of Seller, Buyer, any former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling Person, stockholder, director, officer,
employee, member, manager, general or limited partner, Affiliate, agent or
assignee of any of the foregoing shall have any Liability or obligation for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
Liabilities of Seller or Buyer under this Agreement or of or for any Action
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the breach, termination or failure to consummate such
transactions), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through
a claim by or on behalf of any Party or other Person or otherwise.

 



97 (e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 10.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if the Termination Fee is required to be paid to Buyer as a
result of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_ and
any Buyer Expenses are required to be paid to Buyer pursuant to _Section
10.03(c)_ , then Buyers right to receive payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_ and any Buyer Expenses pursuant to _Section
10.03(c)_, and the payment of any other amounts due pursuant to the last
sentence of  _Section 5.03(b)_ and this _Section 10.03(e)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Buyer, except in the case of fraud, whether at law or
in equity, in contract, in tort, for strict liability, or otherwise, including
any Action, against Seller and the former, current and future holders of any
equity interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, stockholders assignees of Seller, and any future
holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or
assignees of any of the foregoing for any Damages suffered as a result of (i)
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or in any of the other
Transaction Documents or the other agreements, instruments or
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (ii) any
failure of Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or the other agreements, instruments or
document contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (iii) the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or (iv) this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, agreements,
instruments or documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the failure of any such transactions to be
consummated or the termination of this Agreement, and Buyer shall not seek to
recover any other monetary damages or seek any other claim at law or in equity
with respect thereto. Without limiting any other rights of Buyer hereunder, if
Seller fails to pay the Termination Fee and/or Buyer Expenses when due, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences an Action that results in a
final, binding and non-appealable judgment against Seller for the Termination
Fee and/or Buyer Expenses, Seller shall pay to Buyer, together with the
Termination Fee and/or Buyer Expenses, (i) interest on the Termination Fee or
Buyer Expenses, as applicable, from the date of termination of this Agreement
at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum published in The Wall Street
Journal from time to time as the prime lending rate prevailing during any
relevant period and (ii) Buyers out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in connection with such
Action. Without limiting Buyers right to obtain an award of specific
performance permitted by _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way
increasing the amount of the Termination Fee or Buyer Expenses or expanding
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee and/or Buyer Expenses are to be
paid, it is agreed that the Termination Fee and/or Buyer Expenses are
liquidated damages, and not a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall Seller be required to pay the Termination Fee or Buyer Expenses on more
than one occasion.

Section 11.02 _Amendments_ _and_ _Waivers_.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
in _Section_ __ _ 9.07_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, the rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

 

Section 11.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein (including as
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.02_), all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement (i) shall be paid by the Party incurring such
cost or expense.

 

Section 11.04 _Assignment;_ _Successors_ _and_ _Assigns_. No Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the written consent of the other Party hereto; provided,
that, without the consent of Seller, (i) Buyer may assign its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates or, after
the Closing, to an acquirer of all or substantially all of the Business, and
(ii) Buyer may assign its right to acquire all or any portion of the Purchased
Assets which would otherwise be transferred to Buyer at Closing to one or
more of its Affiliates (in which case Seller shall transfer and convey such
Purchased Assets (or portions thereof as specified by Buyer) to such
Person(s)). In the event of an assignment pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
the foregoing sentence, nothing herein shall relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder, including the obligation to pay the Purchase Price; provided that,
to the extent performance or payment is made by an Affiliate or Affiliates of
Buyer with respect to an obligation of Buyer

 



100  hereunder, such obligations shall be satisfied to the extent of such
performance or payment. Subject to the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 11.05 _Governing_ _Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of Law rules of such state. The Parties expressly waive any
right they may have, now or in the future, to demand or seek the application
of a governing law other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 11.06 _Jurisdiction_. The Parties expressly agree that any Action
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of,
relating to or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, if such courts shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), and, in each case, appellate courts therefrom, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits and consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees (i) not to commence any such Action except in such
Court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Action may be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the
extent permitted by law, in such federal court, and (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court or that
any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any Party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such
Party as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ shall be deemed effective service
of process on such Party.

Section 11.07 _Waiver_ _of_ _Trial_ _by_ _Jury_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
(INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMITMENTS SET FORTH IN THE EQUITY COMMITMENT
LETTER). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION, LEGAL
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING

 



101  SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __
_ 11.07_.

 

Section 11.08 _Counterparts;_ _Effectiveness;_ _No_ _Third_ _Party_  
_Beneficiaries_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall
become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other Party hereto. Until and unless each Party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The Parties intend to sign and deliver this Agreement by
facsimile or other electronic transmission. Each Party agrees that the
delivery of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall
have the same force and effect as delivery of original signatures and that
each Party may use such signatures delivered by facsimile or
electronic transmission as evidence of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by all Parties to the same extent that an original signature could
be used. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies or Liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 11.09  _Entire_ _Agreement_. The Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the matters covered hereby and thereby and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties
with respect thereto.

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.11 _Disclosure_   _Schedule_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (a) the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules
that are not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the
convenience of Buyer, (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by
Seller that the matter is required to be

 



102  disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material, (c)
except with respect to the representations and warranties in _Section_ __ _
3.04_, which shall only be qualified by _Schedule 3.04_ in the Disclosure
Schedules, if any Section of the Disclosure Schedules lists an item or
information in such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required
by or provided in another Section of the Disclosure Schedules or the
statements contained in any Section of _ARTICLE III_ reasonably apparent, the
matter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other
section, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to
such other Section or the omission of a reference in the particular
representation and warranty to such Section of the Disclosure Schedule, (d)
except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in
the Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, (e) the
Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific
provisions of this Agreement and (f) the Disclosure Schedules and the
information and statements contained therein are not intended to constitute,
and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or warranties of
Seller except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement.

 

Section 11.12 _Specific_ _Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, of any of
their respective covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, be
entitled, without proof of the inadequacy of monetary damages, to equitable
relief, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other, as applicable, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and agreements of the other under this Agreement (including the
obligation of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). The Parties hereto have specifically bargained for the right to
specific performance of the obligations hereunder, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, notwithstanding the
potential for payment of the Termination Fee and Buyer Expenses in the event
of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.03(a)_.

(b) Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such Party, and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and agreements of such Party under this Agreement in accordance with
the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction, all in
accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.12_. Each Party further
agrees that (i) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ shall require
any Party to institute any

 



103  Action for (or limit any Partys right to institute any Action for) specific
performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _ARTICLE X_ , and (ii) the prevailing
party in any such Action shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and
expenses associated with seeking such relief, including reasonable attorneys
fees.

 

Section 11.13 _Conflicts_ _of_ _Interest_. Buyer hereby waives and shall not
assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause any other applicable Affiliates
to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or
relating to the representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ "), of Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, employees or directors (any
such person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, by Bass, Berry and
Sims PLC (collectively, " _Prior Business Counsel_ "). Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree that, following the Closing, Prior Business
Counsel may serve as counsel to any Designated Person in connection with any
matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement notwithstanding any representation by Prior Business Counsel prior
to the Closing, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby
agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Designated Person,
on the other hand, Prior Business Counsel may represent one or more Designated
Persons in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be
directly adverse to Buyer or its Affiliates.
