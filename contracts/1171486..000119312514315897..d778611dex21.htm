ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_ _._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the Act and the DLLCA, at the Applicable
Time, the Partnership and the General Partner shall be merged with and into
the Merger Subsidiary, and the separate existence of the Partnership and the
General Partner shall thereupon cease. The Merger Subsidiary shall be the
surviving entity (the "Surviving Entity") in the Merger and shall continue its
limited liability company existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.
All references herein to the Merger Subsidiary in respect of actions or
omissions to occur after the Applicable Time shall be deemed to refer to the
Surviving Entity.

SECTION 1.2. _Applicable Time_ _._ The Merger shall be effected through the
filing of a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), in
substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto, with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware as provided in the Act

 



2  and the DLLCA. The Merger shall be effective upon the later of (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or (ii) at such later time as may be specified in the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with applicable Law (the "Applicable Time").

 

SECTION 1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the Act and the DLLCA.

SECTION 1.4. _Organizational Documents_. As of the Applicable Time, (a) the
certificate of formation of Merger Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior
to the Applicable Time, shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving
Entity unless and until thereafter amended and (b) the limited liability
company agreement of Merger Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the
Applicable Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Entity unless and until thereafter amended.

 

SECTION 1.5. _Conversion_. At the Applicable Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of Partnership Interests or
Membership Interests:

(a) each outstanding Common Unit, Preferred Unit, General Partner Unit and
Membership Interest as of immediately prior to the Applicable Time (other
than the Cancelled Interests) shall be converted automatically into and shall
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the amounts
described in Section 2.2, which shall be paid at such times and in accordance
with such procedures as set forth herein, and, as of the Applicable Time, all
such outstanding Common Units, Preferred Units, General Partner Units and
Membership Interests shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and cease to exist;

(b) each outstanding Subordinated Unit and Incentive Distribution Right, and
any Units acquired by Parent or Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Rollover
Agreement (the "Cancelled Interests") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically
be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement; and

 

(c) each limited liability company interest in the Merger Subsidiary
outstanding immediately prior to the Applicable Time shall continue as
a limited liability company interest in the Surviving Entity shown as owned
by the Parent in the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Entity (which will constitute all outstanding limited liability company
interests in the Surviving Entity as of the Applicable Time).

ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

SECTION 2.1. _Calculation of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate amount of Cash Consideration and
Rollover Consideration (together, the "Merger Consideration") to be paid by
NRP and the Parent in respect of the Merger shall be $205,000,000 (the "Base
Consideration"), as such amount is increased or decreased (as the case may be)
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and 2.1(c).

 



3 (b) _Closing Adjustment_

 

(i) No later than three Business Days before the Closing Date, the Partnership
will deliver to the Parent (A) an estimated unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Partnership at and as of 11:59 P.M. on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), (B) a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth its good faith
estimate of the amount of the Closing Cash, any Closing Working Capital
Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, the Closing Indebtedness and
the Transaction Expenses and (C) an updated version of _Exhibit C_ reflecting
the Rollover Consideration and Cash Consideration payable in accordance with
the Estimated Closing Statement ("Updated Exhibit C"). The Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared by the
Partnership in accordance with GAAP and this Agreement applied on a basis
consistent with past practice and the principles used in preparation of the
Latest Balance Sheet (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein). The Parent and its Representatives, including the Parents
independent accountants, will be entitled to review all work papers of the
Partnership and its Representatives, including its independent accountants,
prepared or reviewed in connection with the delivery of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement, as well as access to the
books and records and personnel of the Partnership as the Parent may
reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement. If the Parent disputes the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Estimated Closing Statement (or any
portion thereof) or the Updated Exhibit C prior to the Closing, then the
Parent, the Partnership, and the Holder Representative will negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such dispute at or prior to Closing.

 

(ii) The "Closing Adjustment Amount" shall be an amount equal to (A) the
amount of any Closing Cash,  _minus_ (B) the amount of any Closing
Indebtedness, _minus_ (C) the amount of the Transaction Expenses, and _plus_
or _minus_ , as applicable, (D) the amount of any Closing Working Capital
Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, in each case as
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. If the Closing Adjustment Amount
is a positive number, the Base Consideration shall be increased by the amount
of the Closing Adjustment Amount. If the Closing Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, the Base Consideration shall be decreased by the absolute
value of the amount of the Closing Adjustment Amount.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustment_

 

(i) No earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days following the Closing
Date, the Parent will deliver to the Holder Representative an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership at and as of 11:59 P.M. on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and
a 

 



4  statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the amount of the Closing
Cash, the final amount of Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and
any Closing Working Capital Surplus, and Closing Working Capital Deficiency.
The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement will be prepared by the
Parent in accordance with GAAP and this Agreement applied on a basis
consistent with past practice and the principles used in preparation of the
Latest Balance Sheet (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein); _provided_ , _however_ , that any estimated accrued expenses
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will be updated to account
for actual payments made or invoices received in respect of such accrued
expenses. After receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement, the Holder Representative shall have 15 days (the "Review Period")
to review the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. During the
Review Period, the Holder Representative and its Representatives, including
the Holder Representatives independent accountants, will be entitled
to review all work papers of the Parent and its Representatives, including
its independent accountants, prepared or reviewed in connection with the
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, as well as
access to the books and records and personnel of the Partnership as the
Holder Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement.

 

(ii) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Holder
Representative may object to the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement by delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth the Holder
Representatives objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed
item or amount and the basis for Holder Representatives
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If the Holder
Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Holder Representative. If the Holder Representative delivers
the Statement of Objections prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the
Parent and the Holder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within
the Resolution Period, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and
the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount with such changes as may have been
previously agreed in writing by the Partnership and the Parent, shall be final
and binding.

 

(iii) If the Parent and the Holder Representative fail to reach an agreement
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections
before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in
dispute (the "Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "Independent Accountants") who, acting as experts
and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and adjust the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount accordingly, if necessary. The Independent Accountants shall only
decide the specific items under dispute by the parties. The Independent
Accountants shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30
days (or such other time

 



5  period as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their engagement,
and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and any adjustments to the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be paid by the Holders, on the
one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage of the
Disputed Amounts contested but not awarded to the Holders or Parent,
respectively.

(iv) The "Post-Closing Adjustment Amount" shall be an amount equal to (A) the
amount of any Closing Cash, _minus_ (B) the amount of any Closing
Indebtedness, _minus_ (C) the amount of the Transaction Expenses, and  _plus_
or _minus_ , as applicable, (D) the amount of any Closing Working Capital
Surplus or Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable, in each case as
set forth in the Closing Statement. If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount
is less than the Closing Adjustment Amount, the Holder Representative shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Fund an amount equal to the shortfall; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
shortfall is greater than the amount held in the Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Fund, then the Holder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
disburse from the Indemnification Escrow Fund the amount by which the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the amount in the Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Fund (up to the amount in the Indemnification Escrow Fund). If the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is more than the Closing Adjustment Amount, the
Parent shall pay to the Holder Representative an amount equal to the excess;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such payment shall be made in cash with respect
to any Cash Holder and in NRP Common Units with respect to any Rollover

Partnership Parties have full right and authority to use and operate all of
the improvements, if any, located on the Real Property, subject to applicable
Law and the Permitted Liens. To the Partnerships Knowledge,

easements, rights-of-way, contracts, permits, insurance requirements,
restrictions, building setback lines, restrictive covenants, reservations and
entitlement, subdivision planning and building codes and other land use laws,

regulations or ordinances. Certificates of occupancy and all other material
licenses, permits, authorizations, and approvals required by any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the Real Property have been issued for the
Partnership Parties occupancy of each of such improvements and all such
certificates, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals have been paid

Property and improvements thereon in sufficient quantities and quality to
adequately serve the Real Property and improvements thereon in connection with

currently conducted thereon.

(e) There are no encroachments upon any of the parcels comprising the

and notices required to be filed to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain or transfer
any requisite Consents, Orders, Permits, qualifications, exemptions, waiting
period expirations or terminations or waivers from any Person or Governmental
Authority. In addition, no party shall take any action from the date
hereof until the Closing (other than any action required to be taken under
this Agreement or to which the other parties shall have granted their consent)
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or
result in not obtaining, any Consent, Order, Permit, qualification,
exemption, waiting period expiration or termination or waiver from any
Governmental Authority or other Person required to be obtained prior to
Closing.

 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to any limitations
on access to information provided for in Section 7.5, each party shall
consult with the other parties with respect to, and provide any information
reasonably requested by the other parties in connection with, all material
filings made with any Governmental Authority in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party or any
of its Affiliates receives a request for information or documentary material
from any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then such party shall endeavor in good
faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, after consultation with the other
parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(c) In addition to and without limiting any of the other covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 7.1, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary, the

Governmental Authority, (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any antitrust Law and (v) advise the other parties
promptly of any material communication received by such party from the FTC,
DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party proposes to make or
enter into with the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Concurrently with the filing of notifications under the HSR Act or as
soon thereafter as 

 



34  practicable, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary, the General Partner and the
Partnership shall each request early termination of the applicable "waiting

reasonable efforts" for purposes of this paragraph (c) shall include, at the
request of the Partnership, notifying any Governmental Authority of its
willingness to accept (i) an Order providing for the divestiture by the
Parent of such properties, assets, operations, or businesses of the Parent or
the Partnership as are necessary to permit the Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including an offer to
hold separate such properties, assets, operations or businesses pending any
such divestiture, and (ii) such other conditions, restrictions, limitations or

the conduct of business by the Parent or the Partnership as may be necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by the FTC, DOJ, any
state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust Law. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither NRP nor Parent shall be required to
take or agree to take any action, including a divestiture action, or to limit
or agree to limit the freedom of action of NRP, Parent or any of their

divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement
with respect to, any material assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any
material portion of any business of NRP, Parent, the Partnership Parties or

other representations or warranties that would otherwise be deemed to be made
by themselves, their Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, financial and legal advisors or other
representatives, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

SECTION 7.8. _Litigation Support and Cooperation_. If and for so long as
any party hereto is actively contesting or defending against any Claim or
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the

 



39  General Partner or Partnership (other than an action brought by one party to
this Agreement against another party or parties under the terms of this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), each
of the parties will reasonably cooperate with the contesting or defending
party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel,
and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the
sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party (unless the
contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under Article XII); _provided, however,_ that the obligations of the parties
contained in this Section 7.8 with respect to Claims or Legal Proceedings of
the type described in clause (ii) above shall not apply until after the
Closing unless any such Claims or Legal Proceedings would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or otherwise affect in any material respect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.9. _Supplemental Disclosure_. Each of the Holders, the General
Partner and the Partnership shall have the right and obligation from time to
time during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date to supplement or amend the information contained in the Disclosure
Schedules delivered by it to Parent with respect to any matter first arising
after the date of this Agreement and is not the result of any action taken by
the General Partner or the Partnership that constitutes a breach of its
covenants contained in this Article VII. For purposes of determining whether
the condition in Section 9.1 has been fulfilled or any of the rights to
indemnification under Section 12.2, any such Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to include only that information contained therein on the date of this
Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude any information contained in any
supplement thereof.

SECTION 7.10. _Pay-Off Letters._ No later than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Partnership shall deliver to the Parent (a) invoices
with respect to all expenses listed in (1) and (2) of the definition of
Transaction Expenses incurred prior to or upon Closing (the "Transaction
Expense Invoices") and (b) pay-off letters in customary form in respect of the
repayment at the Closing Date of any other Closing Indebtedness, in each case
setting forth (i) the aggregate amount, including per diem interest, breakage
costs, prepayment penalties, and other fees, required to be paid to discharge
fully such Closing Indebtedness, and (ii) wire transfer instructions for the
applicable administrative agent or creditor, as applicable (the "Pay-off
Letters"). Each Payoff Letter shall provide for the release and termination of
all guarantees and Liens, recourse and other obligations associated with the
Closing Indebtedness that is the subject of such Payoff Letter upon receipt
of the amount specified in such Payoff Letter on the Closing Date.

SECTION 7.11. _Estoppel Certificates_. The Partnership shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an estoppel certificate from each of
the lessors listed on Schedule 7.11, in respect of the Real Estate Leases to
which such lessors are a party, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Parent, certifying to the current validity and effectiveness of such
Real Estate Lease, the absence of material defaults by any party thereunder,
and such other matters as the Parent may reasonably request. For purposes of
this Section 7.11, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not require the
Partnership to sell any assets, pursue any litigation, or pay, incur, convey,
endure, or deliver any monetary payments or other form of consideration,
whether tangible or intangible, including any property, detriment, debt,
right, license, obligation, waiver or release.

 



40 SECTION 7.12. _Unitholder Approval_. Immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the parties, the LP Holders shall deliver to
the Partnership the Written Unitholder Consent, duly executed by each of the
LP Holders. As soon as practicable after receipt of such Written Unitholder
Consent, the Partnership shall provide the Parent with a copy thereof,
certified as true and complete by an executive officer of the Partnership. If
such certified copy is not delivered to the Parent within 24 hours after the
execution of this Agreement, the Parent will have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 11.1(f).

SECTION 7.13. _Insurance Policies_. To the extent the term of any of the
Insurance Policies would expire prior to the Outside Date, the Partnership
shall extend the terms of such Insurance Policies for 60 days.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

SECTION 8.1. _Tax Returns and Reporting_.

 

(a) The Holder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and
timely file (taking into account any applicable extensions), (i) all U.S.
federal income Tax Returns and state income Tax Returns (other than with
respect to state income Taxes imposed directly on the Partnership or the
General Partner) required to be filed by the Partnership or
Partnership Parties which are attributable to taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (including any such Tax Returns which are due after
the Closing Date) and (ii) all other Tax Returns which are required to be
filed by the Partnership Parties, the due date of which (taking into account
extensions) occurs on or before the Closing Date. The Holder Representative
shall prepare and timely file the Tax Returns referred to in this Section
8.1(a) in accordance with its prior practice for preparing and filing the
Partnership Parties Tax Returns (except as otherwise required by applicable
Law), but in no event shall they be filed after November 30, 2014.

 

(b) The Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file (taking
into account any applicable extensions), all Tax Returns required to be filed
by the Partnership Parties other than Tax Returns described in Section 8.1(a).
Not later than 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions thereof)
for any such Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Pre-
Closing Tax Return"), the Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
the Holder Representative a draft of such Pre-Closing Tax Return, together
with the work papers and schedules utilized in its preparation for review and
comment by the Holder Representative, which comments shall be duly
incorporated, with the consent of the Parent (such consent not to be

 



41  unreasonably withheld), in the preparation of the final copy of such Pre-
Closing Tax Return. Promptly upon filing, the Parent shall deliver to the
Holder Representative a copy of each Pre-Closing Tax Return, and the Holder
Representative shall pay to the Parent, any amounts required to be paid in
connection with the filing of the Pre-Closing Tax Return with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent those amounts are not reflected
as liabilities in the Final Balance Sheet.

SECTION 8.2. _No Changes in Elections, etc._ Except as provided in Section 8.5
or Schedule 8.2, the Parent shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates and
the Surviving Entity not to, make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax
Return or take any Tax position on any Tax Return, take any action, omit to
take any action or enter into any transaction that results in any increased
Tax liability or reduction of any Tax asset of the Partnership Holders or the
Partnership Parties in respect of any taxable period or portion thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date. 

SECTION 8.3. _Tax Refunds_. After the Closing Date, any refund, credit or
offset received or utilized by the Parent or any of its Affiliates in respect
of Taxes paid by the Partnership Holders or the Partnership Parties in respect
of any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be paid by the recipient to the Holder
Representative promptly upon receipt.

 

SECTION 8.4. _Tax Contests_. The Parent shall promptly notify the Holder
Representative in writing of any matter which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the Partnership Holders in respect of Taxes pursuant
to Section 12.2 upon receiving written notice of such matter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure of the Parent to give the Holder
Representative notice as provided herein will not relieve the Partnership
Holders of their indemnification obligations under Section 12.2, except as to
the extent that the Partnership Holders are prejudiced by the Parents failure
to give such prompt notice. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to
manage, conduct and control any Tax audits, examinations, appeals, litigation,
or other Tax proceedings relating to Tax items and issues for which the
Partnership Holders are required to indemnify Parent under Section 12.2 or
relating to any Income Tax Return filed by the Partnership or General Partner
in respect of any Pre-Closing Period (each, a "Tax Contest"), unless such Tax
Contest arises in a proceeding that also involves Tax items or issues of the
Parent or any of its Affiliates other than the Partnership Parties or that
also involves Tax items or issues of the Surviving Entity for taxable periods
ending after the Closing Date, in which case the Holder Representative and
the Parent shall jointly control the Tax Contest. In any event, the Parent
shall have the right to participate in, and consult with the Holder
Representative regarding, any Tax Contest described in this paragraph that may
affect the Surviving Entity for any periods ending after the Closing Date at
the Parents own expense, and the Holder Representative shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed of material developments in such Tax Contest and provide
the Parent with copies of any written correspondence from or to the relevant
Tax Authority with respect to such Tax Contest. Any settlement or other
disposition of any Tax Contest (whether administratively or after the
commencement of litigation), which is controlled by the Holder Representative
pursuant to this paragraph and which could reasonably be expected to increase
any Taxes of the Surviving Entity in any taxable period or portion thereof
ending after the Closing Date, may only be settled or disposed with the
written consent of the Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In cases where the Tax Contest is jointly
controlled, neither party may settle or

 



42  concede, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation,
any such Tax Contest without the written consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In no
event shall the Parent be entitled to settle or concede, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any Tax Contest
unless (i) the Holder Representative consents (in writing) to such settlement
or concession, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed or (ii) the Parent agrees to waive its right to be indemnified for the
issue being conceded or settled. In the event of a conflict between
the provisions of this Section 8.4 and Article XII, the provisions of this
Section 8.4 shall control.

SECTION 8.5. _Tax Characterization of Transaction_. The Merger shall be
treated for Federal income tax purposes as (i) a merger of the Partnership
into NRP and (ii) a merger of the General Partner into NRP, in each case
undertaken pursuant to the "assets-over form" described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.708- 1(c)(3)(i). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(4), the Partnership Interests and
Membership Interests (as applicable) held by the Cash Holders are being
purchased by NRP for the portion of the Merger Consideration allocated to the
Cash Holders (together with relief from any liabilities allocable to such
Partnership Interests and Membership Interests under the principles
of Section 752 of the Code), and each Holder that is a Cash Holder,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and each Cash
Holder that is not a Holder, prior to Closing, shall deliver documentation
evidencing that such Cash Holder consents for United States federal income
tax purposes (and to the extent applicable, state or local income tax
purposes) to treat its allocated portion of the Merger Consideration (together
with relief from any liabilities allocable to its Partnership Interests and
Membership Interests under the principles of Section 752 of the Code) as
received for a sale to NRP of the Partnership Interests and Membership
Interests (as applicable) held by such Cash Holder. In the event that
the Partnership (or General Partner) does not have a valid election under
Section 754 of the Code in effect, the parties hereto agree that the
Partnership (or General Partner) will make an election under Section 754 of
the Code that will apply to the transfer of Partnership Interests (or
Membership Interests) pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to the Rollover
Holders, the parties hereto agree to treat the Merger, to the greatest extent
possible, as a non-taxable transaction, including through application of
Section 721 of the Code, the qualified liability rules of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.707-5, and the merger rules of Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-5(f). Any portion of the Merger Consideration that does not qualify as
part of a nontaxable transaction to a Rollover Holder shall, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(4), be treated as the proceeds of a
sale of a portion of the Partnership Interests and Membership Interests (as
applicable) held by the Rollover Holders, and each Rollover Holder,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shall deliver
documentation evidencing that such Rollover Holder consents for United
States federal income tax purposes (and to the extent applicable, state or
local income tax purposes) to treat such taxable amounts as received for a
sale to NRP of an applicable portion of the Partnership Interests and
Membership Interests (as applicable) held by such Rollover Holder. The
remainder of the Merger Consideration (if any) will be considered to be paid
as consideration for a sale of assets to the Parent to the extent that the
transaction constitutes a "sale" of the assets of the Partnership or the
General Partner under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(a)(2).

 



43 SECTION 8.6. _Transfer Taxes_. The Partnership Parties shall bear all sales,
real property, use, excise, gross receipts, transfer, stock, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, permit, license, authorization and similar
Taxes, if any, assessed or payable in connection with the Merger pursuant to
this Agreement; _provided_ that the party legally responsible for any such
Taxes shall timely remit the same, and if the Partnership Holders are the
legally responsible party, the Parent shall promptly reimburse the Holder
Representative for such Taxes, which amount shall be included in Transaction
Expenses.

SECTION 8.7. _Cooperation; Access to Records_. After the Closing Date, each of
the Holder Representative and the Parent shall:

(a) assist (and cause its respective Affiliates to assist) the other party in
preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing
and filing in accordance with Section 8.1;

(b) promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt of notice of any
pending or threatened audits or assessments relating to Taxes for which the
Partnership Holders or the Parent (as the case may be) may be required to pay
indemnification under Article XII; 

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and conducting any audits of or disputes
with any Taxing Authority regarding any Tax Returns of the Partnership
Parties;

(d) make available to the other party, to the Partnership Holders, and to any
Taxing Authority as reasonably requested all records, documents, accounting
data and other information relating to Taxes of or arising in respect of the
Partnership Parties;

 

(e) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from
any Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any Taxes for which the Holders or the Parent (as the case may
be) may be required to pay indemnification under Article XII; and

 

(f) execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this Article VIII.

SECTION 8.8. _Tax Treatment of Payments_. All amounts payable under Sections
12.2 and 12.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for
all Tax purposes, except and to the extent (i) any portion of one or more of
such amounts is treated as interest under Section 1272, 1274 or 483 of the
Code or other provision of the Code and any similar provision of state and
local Tax Law or (ii) otherwise required under applicable Tax Law.

case of clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, notice of the applicable breach is
given to the Parent prior to the end of the survival period set forth in
Section 12.1.

SECTION 12.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) In no event shall the indemnification obligations include any obligation
to provide indemnification for Losses of the type identified in Section

Claims"), whether asserted pursuant to any Individual Claim, Partnership
Claim, Holder Claim or Third-Party Claim, unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Losses arising out of such

 



50  Covered Claims for which indemnification is sought exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to $1,500,000 (the "Indemnity Basket"), in which case
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to Losses in excess of the
Indemnity Basket up to the Ceiling. In addition to the foregoing limitations,
if the total amount of Losses in respect of any Covered Claim (or any series
of Covered Claims arising from the same or substantially similar facts or
circumstances) arising out of a specific breach does not exceed $25,000, then
no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
arising from such Covered Claim but such Losses shall be included for
purposes of determining whether the Indemnity Basket has been exceeded. The
limitations set forth in this Section 12.4(a) shall not apply to Covered
Claims in respect of any breaches of Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.22.

(b) In no event shall the indemnification obligations for Covered Claims
exceed $25,000,000 (the "Ceiling"), except that, for Covered Claims in
respect of any breaches of Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.22, the Ceiling shall be an amount equal
to one hundred percent (100%) of the Merger Consideration minus the amount of
all other Losses in respect of Covered Claims previously paid or payable by
the Parent or the Holders, as applicable, pursuant to this Article XII.

 

(c) No Indemnified Party shall have any claim for indemnification under, and
no Indemnifying Party shall have an obligation to, and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount shall not be available to, indemnify any Indemnified Party under
Section 12.2 or Section 12.3, as applicable, with respect to any Losses
arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty to the extent that,
prior to or at Closing, the Parent had Parents Knowledge or the Partnership
had Partnerships Knowledge of such breach, as applicable, unless the
applicable Indemnified Party shall have delivered a written notice to
the applicable Indemnifying Party at any time prior to the Closing which
identifies such breach, describes in reasonable detail the information in the
possession of the Indemnified Party with respect thereto and states that it is
being delivered to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 12.4(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XII,
any amount payable from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in respect of any
Losses pursuant to Section 12.2 shall be decreased to the extent the amount of
such Losses were accurately reflected in the Closing Statement.

 

SECTION 12.5. _Third-Party Claims_. If any third party asserts a Claim (a
"Third-Party Claim") against an Indemnified Party that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right on the part of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification under Section 12.2 or Section 12.3, the Indemnified Party
shall give notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Holder Representative and
Escrow Agent (in the case of a Third-Party Claim asserted against a Parent
Indemnified Party) or the Parent (in the case of a Third-Party Claim asserted
against a Holder Indemnified Party) as soon as practicable (but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving notice of such
Third-Party Claim), and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume
(with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) at its
sole cost and expense the defense of such Third-Party

 



51  Claim; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure, including to the extent the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party results in Losses to the Indemnifying Party or the
forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses that would otherwise be available
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense if (i) such Third-Party Claim
seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; or
(ii) such Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect Indemnified Partys ongoing or future business. If the
Indemnifying Party is not permitted to assume the defense, elects not to
assume the defense or fails to assume the defense within fifteen (15) Business
Days after receiving notice of such Third-Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent or
defend it against any such Third-Party Claim, and, subject to Section 12.4,
the reasonable out of pocket attorneys fees incurred by the Indemnified
Party for such counsel will be included in the Indemnified Partys Losses;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Partys Losses shall not, in
connection with any Legal Proceeding or separate but substantially similar
Legal Proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, include the
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for
all Indemnified Persons, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition
to its regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend against
such Legal Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party does assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to separate counsel
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested by
the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation
advisable. If the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel, the Indemnifying
Party shall reasonably cooperate in providing information to and consulting
with the Indemnified Party about the Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, enter into
any settlement with respect to any Third-Party Claim it has assumed the
defense of unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party for liability arising out of such claim. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Indemnified
Party consent to the entry of judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to a Third-Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. In the case of any Third-
Party Claim as to which the Holder Representative assumes or conducts the
defense of such claim, the reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses of
such defense shall be shared on a pro rata basis by the Holders, which pro
rata share shall be determined in accordance with the pro rata percentage of
the Merger Consideration set forth opposite each Partnership Holders name on
Updated Exhibit C.

Party), the applicable Holder, the Holder Representative and the Escrow Agent

asserted by a Parent Indemnified Party), the Holder (in the case of an
Individual Claim asserted by a Parent Indemnified Party) or the Parent (in
the case of a Claim asserted against a Holder Indemnified Party), as
applicable, delivers to the Indemnified Party a written response (the
"Response Notice") in which the Holder Representative, Holder or Parent, as
applicable, objects to the payment of some or all of the Claimed Amount to

the dispute.

(c) If the Holder Representative, Holder or Parent, as applicable, and

Partnership Claim, from the Partnership Holders, severally and not jointly, on
a pro rata basis determined in accordance with the pro rata percentage of the
Merger Consideration set forth opposite each Partnership Holders name on
Updated Exhibit C or (B) with respect to an Individual Claim, by such Holder.

 

(e) The Parent shall pay Indemnification Claims of Holders, and Partnership
Holders shall pay Indemnification Claims of NRP and the Parent (to the extent
not satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Fund) in cash.

otherwise prohibited by applicable Law (pursuant to statutory or other
provisions that cannot be waived by the parties), except for the procedures

parties specifically provided for in this Article XII shall be the sole and

calculating the amount of any Loss with respect thereto, any materiality,

representations and warranties shall be disregarded.

Article XII) to pay or otherwise satisfy such Indemnification Claims and the
amount of any Losses with respect to any Indemnification Claim for which
indemnification is available under this Article XII shall be reduced by the
amount of such insurance proceeds or other such funds realized or paid to the
Indemnified Party. If, after the making of any payment in respect of an
Indemnification Claim under this Article XII, the amount of the Losses to
which such payment relates is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise
under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement
or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of such reduction will
promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party. Each
party hereto shall take reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after

context may require, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. In
addition, as used in this Agreement, unless otherwise provided to

SECTION 14.15. _Waiver of Conflicts_. The Parent, the General Partner and the

Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in any matters and
disputes (or any other matter), including in any matter or dispute adverse to
the Parent, the General Partner, the Partnership or the Surviving Entity that
either is existing on the Closing Date or that arises in the future and
relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
the Parent, Merger Subsidiary (on behalf of itself and the Surviving Entity),
the General Partner and the Partnership hereby (i) waives any claim that any
of them have or may have that Baker Botts has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (ii) agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Parent
or the Surviving Entity, on the one hand, and any Holder, the Holder
Representative or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, Baker Botts may
represent such Holder, the Holder Representative or Affiliate in such dispute
even though the interests of such Holder, the Holder Representative or
Affiliate may be directly adverse to the Parent or the Surviving Entity and
even though Baker Botts may have represented the General Partner or the
Partnership in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for the General Partner or the Partnership at any
time prior to the Closing. The Parent (on behalf of itself and the Surviving
Entity), the General Partner and the Partnership each further agree that any
and all documents in Baker Botts files relating to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, any offers or indications of interest
relating to the General Partner or the Partnership or its assets or otherwise
relating to periods prior to the Closing shall be the property of and shall
be retained by Baker Botts and shall not be delivered to the General Partner,
the Partnership, the Surviving Entity, or the Parent.

 

SECTION 14.16. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
taken together shall constitute one instrument binding on all the parties,
notwithstanding that all the parties are not signatories to the original or
the same counterpart.
