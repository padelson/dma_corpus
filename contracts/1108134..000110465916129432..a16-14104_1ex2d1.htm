ARTICLE III 
CONVERSION OF SHARES

 



 

3.1 _Conversion of FCB Stock; Merger Consideration._

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of BHLB, the Bank, FCB or the holders of any of the shares of FCB Stock,
the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

 



 

3.1.1 Each share of capital stock of the Bank that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 



 

3.1.2 All shares of FCB Stock held in the treasury of FCB and each share of
FCB Stock owned by BHLB or the Bank at the Effective Time (other than shares
held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously
contracted) (" **Treasury Stock** ") shall, at the Effective Time, cease to
exist, and such shares, including any Certificates therefor, shall be canceled
as promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefor.

 



 

3.1.3 Subject to a potential adjustment as provided in Sections 3.1.9 and
10.1.9, each outstanding share of FCB Common Stock (other than Treasury Stock
and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.5773
(the " **Exchange Ratio** ") shares of BHLB Common Stock.

 



 

3.1.4 Subject to a potential adjustment as provided in Sections 3.1.9 and
10.1.9, each outstanding share of FCB Preferred Stock (other than Treasury
Stock and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive such
number of shares of BHLB Common Stock as is equal to the product of the Common
Stock Equivalent of such share of FCB Preferred Stock, multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio.

 



 

3.1.5 Each outstanding share of FCB Common Stock, the holder of which has
perfected his right to dissent under applicable law and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the " **Dissenting
Shares** "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by applicable law. FCB shall give BHLB immediate
notice upon receipt by FCB of any such demands for payment of the fair value
of such shares of FCB Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any
other related communications (any shareholder duly making such demand being
hereinafter called a " **Dissenting Shareholder** "), and BHLB shall have the
right to participate in all discussions, negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. FCB shall not, except with the prior written
consent of BHLB, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any

 



      
 

 



 

other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect
appraisal rights under applicable law. Any payments made in respect of
Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Company.

 



 

3.1.6 If any Dissenting Shareholder withdraws or loses (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or prior to the Effective
Time, such holders shares of FCB Stock shall be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Agreement. If such holder withdraws or loses (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after the Effective Time, each
share of FCB Stock of such holder shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

3.1.7 Upon the Effective Time, outstanding shares of FCB Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and shall thereafter by operation of this Section 3.1 represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto or any dividends or distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time that were declared or made by FCB on such shares of FCB
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the
Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 



 

3.1.8 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BHLB Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to BHLB Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of BHLB. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
BHLB shall pay to each former holder of FCB Stock who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of BHLB Common Stock, an amount in
cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of
BHLB Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the five (5) consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of determining any
fractional share interest, all shares of FCB Stock owned by a FCB shareholder
shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of
BHLB Common Stock issuable to such FCB shareholder.

 



 

3.1.9 If BHLB changes (or the BHLB Board sets a related record date that will
occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares
of BHLB Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction,
then the Exchange Ratio (and any other dependent items) will be adjusted
proportionately to account for such change. If FCB changes (or the FCB Board
sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a
change in) the number or kind of shares of FCB Common Stock (or Rights
thereto) outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction,
then the Exchange Ratio (and any other dependent items) will be adjusted
proportionately to account for such change.

 



 

3.2 _Procedures for Exchange of FCB Common Stock._

 



 

3.2.1 _BHLB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, BHLB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of FCB Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2, an aggregate amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable in lieu of the issuance
of fractional shares pursuant to this Article III and shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to issue such cash and shares of BHLB Common Stock for exchange
in accordance with this Section 3.2 (such cash and shares of BHLB Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
(without any interest thereon) being hereinafter referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund** ").

 



 

3.2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. BHLB shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Exchange Agent, not later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of
transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the FCB Common
Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as a result
of the Merger, if any. The letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of

 



      
 

 



 

transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and the Certificate
so surrendered shall be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

 



 

3.2.3 _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder of
a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding FCB
Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with respect to
such FCB Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in exchange for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to BHLB Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 3.2. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 3.2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of BHLB Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

 



 

3.2.4 _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate
evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and
signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and
(ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

3.2.5 _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Closing Date, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FCB of the FCB Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.2.

 



 

3.2.6 _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the nine (9) month
period after the Effective Time, BHLB shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to BHLB (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither BHLB nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

 



 

3.2.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

 



 

3.2.8 _Withholding_. BHLB or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as BHLB (or any Affiliate
thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent
that such amounts are properly withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity by BHLB or the Exchange Agent, such amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the FCB Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
made by BHLB or the Exchange Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

3.3 _Treatment of FCB Stock Options and Warrants._

 



 

3.3.1 _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.3.1_ sets forth all of the outstanding FCB
stock options (each, a " **FCB Stock Option** ") and outstanding FCB warrants
(each, a " **FCB Warrant** ") as of the date hereof. Each FCB Stock Option and
FCB Warrant, in each case whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or
canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, fully vest (to the extent
not vested) and be canceled and, on the Closing Date, BHLB shall pay to the
holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of FCB Common Stock provided for in each such FCB Stock Option or FCB
Warrant, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) $27.71 multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (the " **Exchange Price** ") over (y) the Exercise Price (the " **Cash
Payment** "). Any FCB Stock Option or FCB Warrant for which the Exercise Price
exceeds the Exchange Price shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without
payment. For purposes of this Section 3.3.1, " **Exercise Price** " shall mean
the exercise price per share of FCB Common Stock provided for in such FCB
Stock Option or FCB Warrant. The Cash Payment shall be paid in cash within
five (5) calendar days after the Closing Date, and shall be made without
interest and net of all applicable withholding taxes. Prior to the Closing
Date, FCB shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain written
acknowledgement and consent of each holder of a then-outstanding FCB Stock
Option or FCB Warrant to the termination of the FCB Stock Option or FCB
Warrant and the payment of the Cash Payment in accordance with the terms of
this Section 3.3.1. FCB shall prohibit the exercise of any FCB Stock Option or
FCB Warrant beginning on and after the fifth trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, and FCB shall terminate the FCB Equity Incentive Plan
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time and prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

3.3.2 At the Effective Time, the FCB Equity Incentive Plan and all related
grant agreements thereunder shall terminate and the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of FCB shall be of no further force
and effect.

 



 

3.4 _Reservation of Shares._

 



 

BHLB shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the BHLB
Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of BHLB Common Stock to the FCB
shareholders in accordance with this Article III.

reference to, materiality in any such representation or warranty and (y) any
use of the terms "material," "materially," "in all material respects,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar terms or phrases in any such
representation or warranty. The foregoing standard shall not apply to

4.4.1 FCB has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals and the
approval of this Agreement by FCBs shareholders (the " **FCB Shareholder
Approval** "), to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by FCB and the completion by FCB of the transactions contemplated hereby, up
to and including the Merger, have been duly and validly approved by the Board
of Directors of FCB. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by FCB, and subject to FCB Shareholder Approval and the receipt of
the Regulatory Approvals and due and valid execution and delivery of this
Agreement by BHLB and the Bank, constitutes the valid and binding obligation

4.4.2 (a) Subject to compliance by BHLB with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by FCB, subject to

other investment or obligation to which FCB, FCLS, or any FCB Subsidiary is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound or affected.

 



       
 

 



 

4.5 _Consents._

 



 

Except for (a) the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals and compliance with any
conditions contained therein, (b) compliance with applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws,
(c) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the MDOB and the requisite

FCB, no consents, waivers or approvals of, or filings or registrations with,
any other third parties are necessary, in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by FCB, the completion by FCB of the Merger and the
performance by FCB of its obligations hereunder. To the Knowledge of FCB, no
fact or circumstance exists, including any possible other transaction pending
or under consideration by FCB or any of its Subsidiaries, that (a) would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay in any material respect, (i) any
filings with or approvals or waivers required from the FRB, the FDIC, the
NJDOBI or the MDOB or (ii) any required Regulatory Approvals, (b) would cause
a Bank Regulator or Governmental Entity acting pursuant to the Bank Merger
Act, the BHCA, the New Jersey Banking Law or the Massachusetts General Laws or
any other applicable law or regulation to seek to prohibit or materially delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or impose a Burdensome
Condition or (c) any Bank Regulator or Governmental Entity having jurisdiction
over the affairs of FCB or FCLS, the consent or approval of which is not
required or approval of which is not required pursuant to the rules of which a
filing is not required, will object to the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.6 _Financial Statements._

 



 

4.6.1 The FCB Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material respects
in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices
throughout the periods covered by such reports, and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and changes in shareholders equity of FCB as of and for the periods ended on
the dates thereof, in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

 



 

4.6.2 FCB has previously made available to BHLB the FCB Financial Statements.
The FCB Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects, and (including the related notes where applicable) fairly
present in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the
unaudited interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of FCB and the FCB
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods
ending on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the periods
involved, except as indicated in the notes thereto.

 



 

4.6.3 At the date of the most recent consolidated statement of financial
condition included in the FCB Financial Statements or in the FCB Regulatory
Reports, FCB did not have any liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies
of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type
required to be reflected in such FCB Financial Statements or in the FCB
Regulatory Reports or in the footnotes thereto which are not reflected or
reserved against therein or disclosed in a footnote thereto, in each case to
the extent required in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities,
obligations and loss contingencies which are not material individually or in
the aggregate or which are incurred in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, and subject, in the case of any unaudited
statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes.

 



 

4.7 _Taxes._

 



 

Except as provided in this Agreement, neither FCB nor any of the FCB
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any
action or knows any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. FCB and the
FCB Subsidiaries that are corporations for federal income Tax purposes are
members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section
1504(a). FCB, on behalf of itself and the FCB Subsidiaries, has timely (taking
into account extensions) filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, those filed on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis) required to have been filed by FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries
prior to the date hereof, or requests for extensions to file such returns and
reports have been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and
complete in all material respects. FCB and the FCB

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries have timely paid or, prior to the Effective Time will pay, all
Taxes, whether or not shown on such returns or reports, due or claimed to be
due to any Governmental Entity prior to the Effective Time other than Taxes
which are being contested in good faith. FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries have
declared on their Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise
to a substantial underpayment of United States federal income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state
or local laws). The accrued but unpaid Taxes of FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries
did not, as of the most recent FCB Financial Statements, exceed the reserve
for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face
of the most recent FCB balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). FCB
and the FCB Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of
business. FCB management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of
such audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FCB. FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries have not been
notified in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that
FCB or any of the FCB Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in
such jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither FCB nor any of the FCB
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of a group with which they have filed or
been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other
than a group the common parent of which was FCB or (B) has any liability for
the Taxes of any Person (other than FCB or any of the FCB Subsidiaries) under
Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of the date
hereof, all deficiencies proposed in writing as a result of any audits have
been paid or settled. There are no written claims or assessments pending
against FCB or any FCB Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and
neither FCB nor any FCB Subsidiary has been notified in writing of any
proposed Tax claims or assessments against FCB or any FCB Subsidiary. FCB and
the FCB Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed
all Tax Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time
prescribed under any applicable law. FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries have
delivered to BHLB true and complete copies of all income Tax Returns of FCB
and the FCB Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or after December 31,
2013. Neither FCB nor any of the FCB Subsidiaries is or has been a party to
any "reportable transaction," as defined in Code § 6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg.
§ 1.6011-4(b). Neither FCB nor any of the FCB Subsidiaries has distributed
stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person,
in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in
part by Code § 355 or Code § 361. Neither FCB nor any of the FCB Subsidiaries
has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning
of Code § 897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code §
897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

 



 

4.8 _No Material Adverse Effect._

 



 

Neither FCB nor any FCB Subsidiary has suffered any Material Adverse Effect
since December 31, 2015 and, to FCBs Knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or
reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.

 



 

4.9 _Material Contracts; Leases; Defaults._

 



 

4.9.1 Except as set forth in _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_, neither FCB nor
any FCB Subsidiary is a party to or subject to: (i) any employment, consulting
or severance contract or arrangement with any past or present officer,
director, employee or consultant of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary, except for "at
will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, arrangement or contract providing for
bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement payments, profit
sharing or similar arrangements for or with any past or present officers,
directors, employees or consultants of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary; (iii) any
collective bargaining agreement with any labor union relating to employees of
FCB or any FCB Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement which by its terms limits or
affects the payment of dividends by FCB or any FCB Subsidiary; (v) any
instrument evidencing or related to indebtedness for borrowed money in excess
of $50,000, whether directly or indirectly, by way of purchase money
obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase, guaranty or otherwise, in
respect of which FCB or any FCB Subsidiary is an obligor to any Person, which
instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other than deposits, FHLB
advances with a term to maturity not in excess of one (1) year, repurchase
agreements, bankers acceptances, and transactions in "federal funds" or which
contains financial covenants or other non-customary restrictions (other than
those relating to the payment of principal and interest when due) which would
be applicable on or after the Closing Date to FCB or any FCB Subsidiary; (vi)
any other agreement, written or oral, which is not terminable without cause on
sixty (60) days notice or less without penalty or payment, or that obligates
FCB or any FCB Subsidiary for the

 



      
 

 



 

payment of more than $30,000 annually or for the payment of more than $50,000
over its remaining term; or (vii) any agreement (other than this Agreement),
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral)
that materially restricts or limits the conduct of business by FCB or any FCB
Subsidiary.

 



 

4.9.2 Each real estate lease that will require the consent of the lessor or
its agent as a result of the Merger by virtue of the terms of any such lease,
is listed in _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2_ identifying the section of the
lease that contains such prohibition or restriction. Subject to any consents
that may be required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to its Knowledge neither FCB nor any FCB Subsidiary is in material
default under any material contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement,
lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which
its assets, business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which
it or its assets, business, or operations receive benefits, and there has not
occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default and all such material contracts,
agreements, commitments, arrangements, leases, insurance policies and other
instruments are listed on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2_.

 



 

4.9.3 True and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available to
BHLB on or before the date hereof, are listed on _FCB Disclosure Schedules
4.9.1 and 4.9.2_ and are in full force and effect without modification on the
date hereof. Except as set forth in _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3_, no such
agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement (i) provides for acceleration of the
vesting of benefits or payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change
in ownership or control of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of
a subsequent event; (ii) requires FCB or any FCB Subsidiary to provide a
benefit in the form of FCB Common Stock or determined by reference to the
value of FCB Common Stock or (iii) contains provisions which permit an
employee, director or independent contractor to terminate such agreement or
arrangement without cause and continue to accrue future benefits thereunder.

 



 

4.10 _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 



 

4.10.1 Except as set forth on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.10.1_ , FCB and each
FCB Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, insurable title to all
assets and properties owned by FCB or such FCB Subsidiary, as applicable, in
the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in
the most recent consolidated statement of financial condition contained in the
FCB Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent
that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course
of business, since the date of such consolidated statement of financial
condition), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests
or pledges, except Permitted Liens. FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries, as lessee,
have the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties
used by FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to
occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of
them. Such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or will
constitute operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and
the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases
and lease commitments are as disclosed in all material respects in the notes
to the FCB Financial Statements.

 



 

4.10.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which FCB or any
FCB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, FCB or such FCB Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security
interest (which to FCBs Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the
securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the
value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby.

 



 

4.10.3 FCB and each FCB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by
each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither FCB nor
any FCB Subsidiary, has received notice from any insurance carrier on or
before the date hereof that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with
respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except
as listed on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_, there are presently no claims

4.13 _Employee Benefit Plans._

 



 

4.13.1 _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.13.1_ contains a list of all written and
unwritten pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, deferred
compensation, stock option, employee stock ownership, employee stock purchase,
restricted stock, severance pay, retention, vacation, bonus or other incentive
plans, all employment, change in control, consulting, severance and retention
agreements, all other written employee programs, arrangements or agreements,
all medical, vision, dental, disability, life insurance, workers
compensation, employee assistance or other health or welfare plans, and all
other employee benefit or fringe benefit plans, including "employee benefit
plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by FCB or
any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of employees, former employees,
retirees (or the dependents, including spouses, of the foregoing), directors,
independent contractors or other service providers to FCB or FCLS and under
which employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors,
or other service providers of FCB or FCLS are eligible to participate
(collectively, the " **FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans** "). FCB has furnished or
otherwise made available to BHLB true and complete copies of (i) the plan
documents and summary plan descriptions for each written FCB and FCLS Benefit
Plan, (ii) a summary of each unwritten FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan (if
applicable), (iii) the annual report (Form 5500 series) for the three (3) most
recent years for each FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan (if applicable), (iv) the
actuarial valuation reports with respect to each tax-qualified FCB and FCLS
Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan for the three (3) most
recent years, (v) all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other
funding agreements which currently implement the FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans
(if applicable), (vi) the most recent IRS determination letter with respect to
each tax-qualified FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan (or, for a FCB and FCLS Benefit
Plan maintained under a pre-approved prototype or volume submitter plan, the
IRS determination letter on such pre-approved plan) and (vii) all substantive
correspondence relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any
FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity within the past three (3)
years. Each FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan that may be subject to Section 409A of
the Code (" **FCB Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan** ") has been
maintained and operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code such that
no Taxes under Section 409A of the Code may be imposed on participants in such
plans.

 



 

4.13.2 All FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and
have been managed and administrated in accordance with) the applicable terms
of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. Except as set forth on _FCB
Disclosure Schedule 4.13.2_, each FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan governed by ERISA
that is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either (i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
(and FCB is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of
any such favorable determination letter) or timely application has been made
therefore, or (ii) is maintained under a prototype plan which has been
approved by the IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office
opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of FCB
and the FCB Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely affect
the qualification of any of the FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending claim
against any of the FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by any
participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims for
benefits).

 



 

4.13.3 Except as set forth on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.13.3_, no "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) has been maintained
at any time by FCB or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of the
employees or former employees of FCB or the FCB Subsidiaries.

 



 

4.13.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither FCB nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a FCB and FCLS
Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither FCB nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning of
Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Neither FCB nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied liability (other than PBGC
premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any other individual or entity under Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no event or condition exists that
could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any liability on
FCB or any of its ERISA Affiliates under such provisions or that could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on BHLB or the Bank.

 



      
 

 



 

4.13.5 FCB has complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code (" **COBRA** "), and the regulations thereunder.
All reports, statements, returns and other information required to be
furnished or filed with respect to FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans have been timely
furnished, filed or both in accordance with Sections 101 through 105 of ERISA
and Sections 6057 through 6059 of the Code, and they are true, correct and
complete. To FCBs Knowledge, records with respect to FCB and FCLS Benefit
Plans have been maintained in compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To FCBs
Knowledge, neither FCB nor any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA) with respect to any of FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans has
any liability for any breach of any fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405
or 409 of ERISA. No FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan fails to meet the applicable
requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code (determined without regard to
whether such FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan is self-insured).

 



 

4.13.6 FCB has not, with respect to any FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan, nor, to
FCBs Knowledge, has any administrator of any FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan, the
related trusts or any trustee thereof, engaged in any prohibited transaction
which would subject FCB, any ERISA Affiliate of FCB, or any FCB and FCLS
Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code, or to any other liability under ERISA.

 



 

4.13.7 Except as set forth on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.13.7_, FCB has no
liability for retiree health and life benefits under any FCB and FCLS Benefit
Plan other than any benefits required under COBRA or similar state laws.

 



 

4.13.8 Except as set forth on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.13.8_, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment (including
severance) becoming due to any director or any employee of FCB or FCLS from
FCB or FCLS, respectively, under any FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan, (B) increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan or (C)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefit. Except as set forth on _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.13.8_, no payment
which in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is or
may reasonably be expected to be made by, from or with respect to any FCB and
FCLS Benefit Plan, either alone or in conjunction with any other payment will
or could properly be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code on which an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code
is payable or will or could, either individually or collectively, provide for
any payment by FCB or any of its ERISA Affiliates that would not be deductible
under Code Section 162(m).

 



 

4.13.9 The actuarial present values of all accrued FCB Non-qualified Deferred
Compensation Plans (including, to the extent applicable, entitlements under
any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement)
of employees and former employees of FCB or FCLS and their respective
beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement
plans subject to the provisions of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, have been fully reflected on the FCB Financial Statements to the extent
required by and in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

4.13.10 There is not, and has not been, any trust or fund maintained by or
contributed to by FCB or its employees to fund an employee benefit plan which
would constitute a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association or a "welfare
benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419(a) of the Code.

 



 

4.13.11 No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been asserted or
instituted or, to the Knowledge of FCB, has been threatened or is anticipated,
against any FCB and FCLS Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits
and appeals of such claims), FCB or any FCB Subsidiary or any director,
officer or employee thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any FCB and
FCLS Benefit Plan.

 



 

4.14 _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors._

 



 

Neither FCB nor any FCB Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to any such
Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except for the retention of Houlihan Lokey by FCB and the

 



      
 

 



 

fees payable pursuant thereto. A true and correct copy of each of the
engagement agreement with Houlihan Lokey setting forth the fees payable to
Houlihan Lokey for its services rendered to FCB in connection with the Merger
and transactions contemplated by this Agreement, is attached to _FCB
Disclosure Schedule 4.14_.

by this Agreement.

 



 

5.6 _Financial Statements._

 



 

5.6.1 The BHLB Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material respects
in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices
throughout the periods covered by such statements, and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and changes in shareholders equity of BHLB as of and for the periods ended on
the dates thereof, in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

 



 

5.6.2 BHLB has previously made available to FCB the BHLB Financial Statements.
The BHLB Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in
all material respects, and (including the related notes where applicable)
fairly present in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of
the unaudited interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of BHLB
and the Bank on a consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods
ending on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the periods
involved, except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

 



 

5.6.3 At the date of the most recent consolidated statement of financial
condition included in the BHLB Financial Statements or in the BHLB Regulatory
Reports, BHLB did not have any liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies
of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type
required to be reflected in such BHLB Financial Statements or in the footnotes
thereto which are not fully reflected or reserved against therein or fully
disclosed in a footnote thereto, in each case to the extent required in
accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities, obligations and loss
contingencies which are not material individually or in the aggregate or which
are incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice, and subject, in the case of any unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes.

 



 

5.7 _Taxes._

 



 

5.7.1 Except as provided in this Agreement, neither BHLB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any
action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. BHLB and
the BHLB Subsidiaries that are corporations for federal income Tax purposes
are members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section
1504(a). BHLB, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, has timely (taking
into account extensions) filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, those filed on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis) required to have been filed by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries
prior to the date hereof, or requests for extensions to file such returns and
reports have been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and
complete in all material respects. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have timely
paid or, prior to the Effective Time will pay, all Taxes, whether or not

 



      
 

 



 

shown on such returns or reports, due or claimed to be due to any Governmental
Entity prior to the Effective Time other than Taxes which are being contested
in good faith. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have declared on their Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
underpayment of United States federal income Tax within the meaning of Section
6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local laws). The
unpaid accrued but unpaid Taxes of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries did not, as
of the most recent BHLB Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
most recent BHLB balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). BHLB and
its Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of business.
BHLB management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of such
audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on BHLB. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have not been notified
in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that BHLB or any
of the BHLB Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in such
jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries
(A) has been a member of a group with which they have filed or been included
in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other than a group
the common parent of which was BHLB or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of
any Person (other than BHLB or any of the BHLB Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg.
§ 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of the date hereof, all
deficiencies proposed in writing as a result of any audits have been paid or
settled. There are no written claims or assessments pending against BHLB or
any BHLB Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and neither BHLB
nor any BHLB Subsidiary has been notified in writing of any proposed Tax
claims or assessments against BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary. BHLB and the BHLB
Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so withheld and
paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed all Tax Returns
with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time prescribed under any
applicable law. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have delivered to FCB true and
complete copies of all income Tax Returns of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries
for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2013. Neither BHLB nor any
of the BHLB Subsidiaries is or has been a party to any "reportable
transaction," as defined in Code § 6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b).
Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries has distributed stock of another
Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction
that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code §
355 or Code § 361. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries has been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code §
897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

 



 

5.8 _No Material Adverse Effect._

 



 

Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has suffered any Material Adverse Effect
since December 31, 2015 and, to BHLBs Knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or
reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BHLB.

 



 

5.9 _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 



 

5.9.1 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.1_ , BHLB and each
BHLB Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, insurable title to all
assets and properties owned by BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as applicable, in
the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in
the most recent consolidated statement of financial condition contained in the
BHLB Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent
that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course
of business, since the date of such consolidated statement of financial
condition), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests
or pledges, except Permitted Liens. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries, as lessee,
have the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties
used by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to
occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of
them. Such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or will
constitute operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and
the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases
and lease commitments are as disclosed in all material respects in the notes
to the BHLB Financial Statements.

 



 

5.9.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which BHLB or any
BHLB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as the

 



      
 

 



 

case may be, has a lien or security interest (which to BHLBs Knowledge is a
valid, perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral securing
the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds
the amount of the debt secured thereby.

 



 

5.9.3 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by
each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither BHLB
nor any BHLB Subsidiary, has received notice from any insurance carrier on or
before the date hereof that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with
respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except
as listed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_, there are presently no claims
pending under such policies of insurance and no notices of claim have been
given by BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance
is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect (other than insurance
that expires in accordance with its terms), and within the last three (3)
years BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has received each type of insurance
coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any claims submitted under any of its insurance policies.
_BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_ identifies all policies of insurance
maintained by BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary, including the name of the
insurer, the policy number, the type of policy and any applicable deductibles,
as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this Section
5.9.3. BHLB has made available to FCB copies of all of the policies listed on
_BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_.

 



 

5.10 _Legal Proceedings._

 



 

Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.10_ , there is no suit,
action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened
against or affecting BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries (and it is not aware of
any facts that reasonably could be expected to form the basis for any such
suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a Governmental Entity or Bank
Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the aggregate, is (A) material to
it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or reasonably likely to result in a
restriction on its or any of its Subsidiaries businesses or, or after the
Effective Time, BHLBs or any of its Subsidiaries businesses, or (B)
reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations
under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. There
is no injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement, decree or written
regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by BHLB, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law._

 



 

Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.11_:

 



 

5.11.1 To BHLBs Knowledge, BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees
applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its business, its
conduct of business and its relationship with its employees, including,

Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full
force and effect and, to the Knowledge of BHLB, no suspension or cancellation
of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or
will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals.

 



 

5.11.3 For the period beginning January 1, 2012, neither BHLB nor any BHLB
Subsidiary has received any written notification or any other communication
from any Bank Regulator or Insurance Regulator (i) asserting that BHLB or any
BHLB Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations

 



      
 

 



 

or ordinances which such Bank Regulator or Insurance Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental

authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks, bank
holding companies or insurance agencies, or engages in the insurance of bank

operations of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary, including without limitation any
restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or
limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or
any BHLB Subsidiary. Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has consented to or

recent regulatory rating given to the Bank as to compliance with the CRA is
"Satisfactory" or better.

 



 

5.12 _Employee Benefit Plans._

 



 

5.12.1 _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.1_ contains a list of all written and
unwritten pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, deferred
compensation, stock option, employee stock ownership, employee stock purchase,
restricted stock, severance pay, retention, vacation, bonus or other incentive
plans, all employment, change in control, consulting, severance and retention
agreements, all other written employee programs, arrangements or agreements,
all medical, vision, dental, disability, life insurance, workers
compensation, employee assistance or other health or welfare plans, and all
other employee benefit or fringe benefit plans, including "employee benefit
plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by BHLB or
any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of employees, former employees,
retirees (or the dependents, including spouses, of the foregoing), directors,
independent contractors or other service providers to BHLB and under which
employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, or
other service providers of BHLB are eligible to participate (collectively, the
" **BHLB Benefit Plans** "). BHLB has furnished or otherwise made available to
FCB true and complete copies of (i) the plan documents and summary plan
descriptions for each written BHLB Benefit Plan, (ii) a summary of each
unwritten BHLB Benefit Plan (if applicable), (iii) the annual report (Form
5500 series) for the three (3) most recent years for each BHLB Benefit Plan
(if applicable), (iv) the actuarial valuation reports with respect to each
tax-qualified BHLB Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan for the
three (3) most recent years, (v) all related trust agreements, insurance
contracts or other funding agreements which currently implement the BHLB
Benefit Plans (if applicable), (vi) the most recent IRS determination letter
with respect to each tax-qualified BHLB Benefit Plan (or, for a BHLB Benefit
Plan maintained under a pre-approved prototype or volume submitter plan, the
IRS determination letter on such pre-approved plan) and (vii) all substantive
correspondence relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any
BHLB Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity within the past three (3) years. Each
BHLB Benefit Plan that may be subject to Section 409A of the Code (" **BHLB
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan** ") has been maintained and operated
in compliance with Section 409A of the Code such that no Taxes under Section
409A of the Code may be imposed on participants in such plans.

 



 

5.12.2 All BHLB Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and have been
managed and administrated in accordance with) the applicable terms of ERISA,
the Code and any other applicable laws. Except as set forth on _BHLB
Disclosure Schedule 5.12.2_, each BHLB Benefit Plan governed by ERISA that is
intended to be a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code
has either (i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (and
BHLB is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter) or timely application has been made
therefore, or (ii) is maintained under a prototype plan which has been
approved by the IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office
opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely affect
the qualification of any of the BHLB Benefit Plans intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending claim against
any of the BHLB Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by any participant,
beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims for benefits).

 



 

5.12.3 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.3_, no "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) has been maintained
at any time by BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of the
employees or former employees of BHLB or its Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

5.12.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither BHLB nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a BHLB Benefit
Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither BHLB nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning of Section
4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Neither BHLB nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied liability (other than PBGC
premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any other individual or entity under Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no event or condition exists that
could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any liability on
BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates under such provisions or that could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on BHLB or the Bank.

 



 

5.12.5 BHLB has complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation requirements of COBRA, and the regulations thereunder. All
reports, statements, returns and other information required to be furnished or
filed with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been timely furnished, filed or
both in accordance with Sections 101 through 105 of ERISA and Sections 6057
through 6059 of the Code, and they are true, correct and complete. To BHLBs
Knowledge, records with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been maintained in
compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To BHLBs Knowledge, neither BHLB nor
any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with
respect to any of BHLB Benefit Plans has any liability for any breach of any
fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No BHLB Benefit Plan
fails to meet the applicable requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code
(determined without regard to whether such BHLB Benefit Plan is self-insured).

 



 

5.12.6 BHLB has not, with respect to any BHLB Benefit Plan, nor, to BHLBs
Knowledge, has any administrator of any BHLB Benefit Plan, the related trusts
or any trustee thereof, engaged in any prohibited transaction which would
subject BHLB, any ERISA Affiliate of BHLB, or any BHLB Benefit Plan to a Tax
or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code, or to any other liability under ERISA.

 



 

5.12.7 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.7_, BHLB has no
liability for retiree health and life benefits under any BHLB Benefit Plan
other than any benefits required under COBRA or similar state laws.

 



 

5.12.8 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.8_, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment (including
severance) becoming due to any director or any employee of BHLB from BHLB
under any BHLB Benefit Plan, (B) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any BHLB Benefit Plan or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefit. Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure
Schedule 5.12.8_, no payment which in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is or may reasonably be expected to be made by,
from or with respect to any BHLB Benefit Plan, either alone or in conjunction
with any other payment will or could properly be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code on which an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code is payable or will or could, either individually or
collectively, provide for any payment by BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates
that would not be deductible under Code Section 162(m).

 



 

5.12.9 The actuarial present values of all accrued BHLB Non-qualified Deferred
Compensation Plans (including, to the extent applicable, entitlements under
any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement)
of employees and former employees of BHLB and their respective beneficiaries,
other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to
the provisions of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, have been
fully reflected on the BHLB Financial Statements to the extent required by and
in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

5.12.10 There is not, and has not been, any trust or fund maintained by or
contributed to by BHLB or its employees to fund an employee benefit plan which
would constitute a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association or a "welfare
benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419(a) of the Code.

 



 

5.12.11 No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been asserted or
instituted or, to the Knowledge of BHLB, has been threatened or is
anticipated, against any BHLB Benefit Plan (other than routine

 



      
 

 



 

claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary
or any director, officer or employee thereof, or any of the assets of any
trust of any BHLB Benefit Plan.

 



 

5.13 _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors._

 



 

Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to any such
Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for the retention of Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. by BHLB and the
fee payable thereto. A true and correct copy of the engagement agreement with
Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P., setting forth the fee payable to Sandler
ONeill and Partners, L.P. for its services rendered to BHLB in connection with
the Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement is attached to
_BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.13_.

 



 

5.14 _BHLB Information Supplied._

 



 

The information relating to BHLB and any BHLB Subsidiary to be contained in
the Merger Registration Statement, or in any other document filed with any
Bank Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

5.15 _Securities Documents._

 



 

Since January 1, 2014, BHLB has filed with the SEC all forms, reports,
schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy statements and
information statements or other filings (" **BHLB SEC Reports** ") required to
be filed by it with the SEC. As of their respective dates, the BHLB SEC
Reports complied as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder in all material respects. As of their respective
dates and as of the date any information from the BHLB SEC Reports has been
incorporated by reference, the BHLB SEC Reports did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. BHLB has filed
all material contracts, agreements and other documents or instruments required
to be filed as exhibits to the BHLB SEC Reports (the " **BHLB Material
Agreements** ").

 



 

5.16 _Internal Controls._

 



 

5.17.1 The records, systems, controls, data and information of BHLB and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of BHLB or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. BHLB and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. BHLB has designed
and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15D-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

 



 

5.17.2 BHLBs management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. It has previously disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of the FCB
Board; (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or

 



      
 

 



 

other employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over
financial reporting.

 



 

5.17.3 Since December 31, 2015, (A) neither BHLB nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to its knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of it or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that it or any of its
subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(B) no attorney representing BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by it or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
BHLB or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its board of
directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors or officers.

by the shareholders of FCB pursuant to this Agreement is fair to BHLB and its
shareholders from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended
or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

5.20 _Board Approval._

presently in default or, during the three (3)-year period prior to the date of

All interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and forward
contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether entered into

Subsidiaries or their customers, in force and effect as of March 31, 2016 (all
of which are set forth in _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.26_), were entered into
in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies, and to the Knowledge of BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary, with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time; and to
BHLBs and each BHLB Subsidiarys Knowledge each of them constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force and
effect. Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary, nor any other party thereto, is
in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or arrangement.

 



 

5.23 _Duties as Fiduciary._

required by virtue of any line of business in which it is or previously was
engaged in a "fiduciary capacity," to its Knowledge has performed all of its
duties in a fashion that complied with all applicable laws, regulations,
orders, agreements, wills, instruments, and common law standards in effect at
that time. The Bank has not received notice of any claim, allegation, or
complaint from any Person that the Bank failed to perform these duties in a
manner that complied with all applicable laws, regulations, orders,
agreements, wills, instruments, and common law standards, except for notices
involving matters that have been resolved and any cost of such resolution is
reflected in the BHLB Financial Statements. For purposes of this Section 5.27,
the term "fiduciary capacity" (i) shall mean (a) acting as trustee, executor,
administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, transfer agent, guardian,
assignee, receiver, or custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act and (b)
possessing investment discretion on behalf of another, and (ii) shall exclude
the Banks capacity with respect to individual retirement accounts or the BHLB
Benefit Plans.

 



 

5.24 _Employees; Labor Matters._

 



 

There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements to which BHLB or any
BHLB Subsidiary is a party. There is no union organizing effort pending or, to
the Knowledge of BHLB, threatened against BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary. There
is no labor strike, labor dispute (other than routine employee grievances that

Subsidiary. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of BHLB, threatened against BHLB or any BHLB
Subsidiary (other than routine employee grievances that are not related to

under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of FCB or any FCB
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.3.2 FCB and BHLB shall cooperate regarding a plan for the conversion of data
processing and related electronic informational systems of FCB to those used
by BHLB, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, discussion of
the possible termination by FCB of third-party service provider arrangements

6.3.3 FCB shall provide BHLB, within fifteen (15) Business Days of the end of
each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming assets (the term

Codification 310-40, (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii) real estate owned, (iv)
all loans ninety (90) days or more past due as of the end of such month and

or any FCB Subsidiary under any labor or employment law.

 



 

6.4 _Access to Properties and Records._

 



 

Subject to Section 11.1, FCB shall permit BHLB access upon reasonable notice
and at reasonable times to its properties and those of the FCB Subsidiaries,
and shall disclose and make available to BHLB during normal business hours all
of its books and records relating to the assets, properties, operations,
obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of
account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors and shareholders meetings (other than minutes that discuss any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter
that FCB reasonably determines should be kept confidential), organizational
documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings with any
regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities or prospects in which BHLB may have a reasonable
interest; _provided, however,_ that FCB shall not be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure, in FCBs reasonable judgment, would interfere with the
normal conduct of FCBs business or would violate or prejudice the rights or
business interests or confidences of any customer or other Person or entity or
would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel or contravene any applicable law. FCB shall
provide and shall request its auditors to provide BHLB with such historical
financial information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as
BHLB may reasonably request for Securities Law disclosure purposes. BHLB shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with FCBs
and FCB Subsidiaries regular business operations during any such access to
FCBs and FCBs Subsidiaries property, books and records. FCB and each FCB
Subsidiary shall permit BHLB, at BHLBs expense, to (i) cause a Phase I
environmental assessment to be performed at any physical location owned or
occupied by FCB or any FCB Subsidiary, subject to compliance with the
applicable lease in the case of any non-owned, occupied location, and (ii)
cause an appraisal to be performed in respect of any real property owned by

accounting firm rendering internal audit services, in connection with each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries
made by such accountants.

 



 

6.5.2 As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents are filed with the FDIC, NJDOBI, or any other state regulatory
agency regulating the business of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary, FCB will deliver

twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month, FCB will deliver to BHLB a

without related notes, for such month prepared in accordance with current
financial reporting practices, as well as a month-end and year to date
comparison to budget.

 



 

6.5.3 To the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation, FCB promptly
will advise upon receipt and permit review by BHLB of any inquiry or
examination report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or
activities of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary.

financial data that FCB possesses and as BHLB may reasonably request,
including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports and detailed deposit reports.

 



 

6.6 _Maintenance of Insurance._

 



 

FCB shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, and to cause the
FCB Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to
cover such risks as are customary in relation to the character and location of
its properties and the nature of its business, with such coverage and in such
amounts not less than that maintained by FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries as of
the date of this Agreement and set forth in _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_.
FCB will promptly inform BHLB if FCB or any FCB Subsidiary receives notice
from an insurance carrier that (i) an insurance policy will be canceled or
that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs
with respect to any policy of insurance will be substantially increased.

 



 

6.7 _Disclosure Supplements._

 



 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, FCB will promptly supplement or
amend the FCB Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such FCB Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in such FCB Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such FCB Disclosure Schedule
shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article IX.

 



 

6.8 _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 



 

FCB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each FCB
Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons or entities
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

6.9 _All Reasonable Efforts._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, FCB agrees to use, and

done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.10 _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 



 

In the event that FCB determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify BHLB.

 



 

6.11 _No Solicitation._

 



 

6.11.1 From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
neither FCB, nor any FCB Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, agents and affiliates including,
without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by
FCB or any of the FCB Subsidiaries (collectively, " **Representatives** "),
will, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information or assistance) any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined by Section 6.11.2),
or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any Person
in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal or agree
to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or authorize or permit any of its
officers, directors, or employees or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by any of its Subsidiaries to take any such action, and FCB shall
notify BHLB orally and in writing (as promptly as practicable but no later
than one business day of receipt of such inquiry or proposal) of all of the
relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals which FCB or any of
the FCB

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or employees, or,
to FCBs Knowledge, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants or other representatives of FCB may receive relating to any of
such matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section
6.11 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of FCB from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under federal or state law; or (ii) prior to the
receipt of FCB Shareholder Approval, furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, any Person or entity that makes an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.11 by FCB,
(B) the Board of Directors of FCB or any appropriate committee thereof has
determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with FCBs financial
advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably
likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof) and regulatory
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and (C) such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more
favorable to FCB shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger
(taking into account all relevant factors, including, without limitation, the
timing of consummation as compared to the Merger and after giving effect to
all of the adjustments, if any, which may be offered by BHLB pursuant to
Section 10.1.8) (such proposal that satisfies clauses (A), (B) and (C) being
referred to herein as a " **Superior Proposal** "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit FCB and, if
applicable, any of its Representatives from (i) informing any Person of the
existence of the provisions of this Section 6.11, (ii) contacting any Person
solely to clarify the terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) otherwise disclosing any information to its shareholders that the FCB
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that it is required to disclose in order to not breach
its fiduciary duties to FCBs shareholders under applicable law, subject to
compliance with the requirements of this Section 6.11 and Section 6.12. FCB
shall promptly, but in no event later than one (1) calendar day, notify BHLB
of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated
or continued with FCB or any of its representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement in form and substance identical
in all material respects to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.11.2 " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean any proposal or offer as to any
of the following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder)
involving FCB or any of the FCB Subsidiaries: (i) any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, or other similar transactions; (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25%
or more of the assets of FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
single transaction or series of transactions; (iii) any tender offer or
exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
FCB or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in
connection therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or
intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the
foregoing.

 



 

6.12 _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings._

 



 

Following the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals (without regard to any
waiting periods associated therewith), FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries shall
permit two (2) representatives of BHLB to attend any meeting of their Board of
Directors, executive committee, loan (or credit) committee and asset liability
committee as observers (together, the " **BHLB Observers** "), provided that
neither FCB nor any FCB Subsidiary shall be required to permit the BHLB
Observers to remain present during any confidential discussion of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition Proposal
or during any other matter that the respective Board of Directors has been
advised of by counsel that such attendance by the BHLB Observers may violate
or be inconsistent with a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any
legal or regulatory requirement.

 



 

6.13 _FCB 401(k) Plan._

 



 

Effective as of the day preceding the Closing Date, and subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, in the sole discretion of BHLB, BHLB may
direct FCB to adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to cause the FCB 401(k)
Plan (the " **FCB 401(k) Plan**") to be terminated, merged or other such
actions as permitted by applicable law, including, but not limiting to,
amending the FCB 401(k) Plan to provide that: (i) the plan sponsor will be
FCLS instead of FCB, (ii) the plan name will change to the FCLS 401(k) Plan,
(iii) only employees of FCLS will be eligible to participate in the FCLS
401(k) Plan and any employees of a controlled group, within the meaning of
Section 414(b) of the Code, will be excluded from participating in the FCLS
401(k) Plan, and (iv) as may be further

 



      
 

 



 

amended pursuant to the direction of BHLB. The form and substance of such
resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be subject to the review and
approval of BHLB, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. FCB shall deliver
to BHLB an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as
soon as practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of FCB
and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments.

 



 

6.14 _Tangible Book Value._

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Tangible Book Value** " shall mean, on a
consolidated basis, FCBs and FCBs Subsidiaries (a) total assets on a
consolidated basis less (b) the sum of (i) total liabilities, (ii) goodwill,
and (iii) total intangible assets. For purposes of calculating Tangible Book
Value and Final Tangible Book Value, the parties shall not give any effect to
adjustments from June 20, 2016 to the Closing Date related to actions which
are not consistent with FCBs ordinary and customary methods or practices or
GAAP, including but not limited to, any reduction in the allowance for loan
losses or the provisions thereto, the gain on sale of any securities or loans
not in the ordinary course of business, the conversions of unrealized gains to
realized gains, increases or decreases in unrealized gains on securities,
decreases in non-interest expenses or the deferral of any obligation due in
the ordinary course of business, and the related tax effect of any of these
listed adjustments. The calculation of Tangible Book Value per share shall
include each share of FCB Common Stock issued after giving effect to the
conversion of all of the FCB Preferred Stock prior to the Effective Time, as
described in Section 3.4, and the exercise of all of the FCB Stock Options and
FCB Warrants prior to the Effective Time. For the purpose of assessing
Tangible Book Value, BHLB may request from FCB, and FCB shall provide, such
reasonable information and documentation that provides support to FCBs
determination of Tangible Book Value, consistent with this Section, GAAP and
FCBs past practices.

 



 

6.15 _FCB Common Stock Special Dividend._

 



 

Provided that Final Tangible Book Value per share exceeds $14.22 per share and
FCB has a positive Core Net Income, FCB may pay a per share dividend to the
holders of FCB Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in an
aggregate amount not to exceed 35% of Core Net Income in excess of the $14.22
Tangible Book Value per share.

Subsidiary to: operate its business only in the usual, regular and ordinary
course of business; use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its
business organization and assets and maintain its rights and franchises; and

the Bank) or bylaws in any way adverse to the rights of the FCB shareholders,
except as required by law, except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule
7.1.1(A)(i)_ ; (ii) materially adversely affect the ability of the parties to
obtain the Regulatory Approvals or materially increase the period of time
necessary to obtain such approvals; (iii) materially adversely affect its

result in the representations and warranties contained in Article V of this
Agreement not being true and correct on the date of this Agreement or at any

reasonably likely to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(B) Promptly after the Closing and prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the Exchange
Fund.

 



      
 

 



 

7.2 _Disclosure Supplements._

 



 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, BHLB will promptly supplement
or amend the BHLB Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct
any information in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such BHLB
Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

 



 

7.3 _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 



 

BHLB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each BHLB
Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

7.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, BHLB agrees to use and
agrees to cause each BHLB Subsidiary to use reasonable best efforts in good
faith to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.

 



 

7.5 _Employees; Benefit Plans_

 



 

Following the Closing Date, BHLB may choose to maintain any or all of the FCB
and FCLS Benefit Plans in its sole discretion and FCB and FCLS shall cooperate
with BHLB in order to effect any plan terminations to be made as of the
Effective Time.

 



 

7.5.1 _Benefit Plans Covering FCB Employees_. For any FCB benefit plan, which
generally covers only FCB employees, which is terminated and for which there
is a comparable BHLB Benefit Plan of general applicability, BHLB shall take
all reasonable action so that eligible FCB employees at the Closing Date and
who remain so employed immediately following the Effective Time (the "
**Continuing FCB Employees** ") shall be entitled to participate in such BHLB
Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of BHLB (it
being understood that inclusion of Continuing FCB Employees in the BHLB
Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans and
that this Section 7.5.1 does not apply to FCLS employees). BHLB shall cause
each BHLB Benefit Plan in which Continuing FCB Employees are eligible to
participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
the BHLB Benefit Plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) the service
of such employees with FCB to the same extent as such service was credited for
such purpose by FCB; _provided, however,_ that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of BHLB to amend or
terminate any of the FCB and FCLS Benefit Plans or BHLB Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms at any time; _provided, however,_ that BHLB shall
continue to maintain the FCB benefit plans (other than stock-based or
incentive plans) for which there is a comparable BHLB Benefit Plan until the
FCB employees are permitted to participate in the BHLB Benefit Plans, unless
such BHLB Benefit Plan has been frozen or terminated with respect to
similarly-situated employees of BHLB or any Subsidiary of BHLB.

 



 

7.5.2 _Benefit Plans Covering FCLS Employees_. An FCLS benefit plan, which
generally covers only FCLS employees at the Closing Date (the " **FCLS Benefit
Plans** "), may be continued, modified or terminated after the Effective Time.
To the extent such plan or plans are not terminated, eligible FCLS employees
at the Closing Date and who remain so employed immediately following the
Effective Time (the " **Continuing FCLS Employees** ") shall be entitled to
participate in the FCLS Benefit Plans to the same extent as such employees
participated in the FCLS Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of BHLB to amend or terminate any
of the FCLS Benefit Plans

 



 

7.5.3 _Bank 401(k) Plan Participation_. All Continuing FCB Employees shall be
eligible to participate in Banks 401(k) plan on the day after the Closing
Date. All rights to participate in Banks 401(k) Plan

 



       
 

 



 

are subject to Banks right to amend or terminate Banks 401(k) plan in its
sole and absolute discretion and are subject to the terms of Banks 401(k)
plan including, but not limited to, the eligibility and vesting provisions of
such plan. Continuing FCLS Employees shall continue to participate in the FCB
401(k) Plan or its successor, subject to Section 6.13 of this Agreement and as
the plan may be further amended in the sole discretion of BHLB.

 



 

7.5.4 _Welfare Benefits_. If Continuing FCB Employees become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or health plan of BHLB upon termination of
such plan of FCB or FCLS, BHLB shall make all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to
the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or
dental plans of BHLB, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment
and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries
during the portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective
Time, in each case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous FCB Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time. Continuing FCLS Employees will continue to be covered by
medical, dental and health plans as maintained by FCLS prior to the Closing
Date, and the FCLS benefit plan may be amended or terminated in the sole
discretion of BHLB.

 



 

7.5.5 _Paid Time Off Programs_. BHLB will give Continuing FCB Employees
credit, for purposes of BHLBs vacation and/or other paid leave benefit
programs, for such individuals accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave
balance with FCB as of the Closing Date. Continuing FCLS Employees may
continue to be covered by paid time off programs maintained by FCLS prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

7.5.6 _BHLB to Honor Agreements_. Subject to any required regulatory approval
or satisfaction of a condition in any Regulatory Approval, BHLB agrees to
honor all employment agreements, change in control agreements, severance
agreements, deferred compensation agreements and consulting agreements that
FCB and FCLS has with its current and former employees and which have been
identified in _FCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_, except to the extent any such
agreements shall be superseded or terminated at the Closing Date or following
the Closing Date with the written consent of the affected parties and provided
that no payments made under such agreements would be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" as such term is defined in Code Section 280G.

 



 

7.5.7 _No Guarantee of Employment, Severance_. Except to the extent of
commitments herein or other contractual commitments, if any, specifically made
or assumed by BHLB hereunder or by operation of law, BHLB shall have no
obligation arising from and after the Closing Date to continue in its employ
or in any specific job or to provide to any specified level of compensation or
any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites to any Person who is an
employee of FCB of any FCB Subsidiary as of the Closing Date. Each Person who
is an employee of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and who is
terminated by BHLB for a reason other than cause within twelve (12) months
subsequent to the Closing Date or is not offered employment with BHLB as of
the Effective Time or resigns for good reason, excluding those employees who
are entitled to benefits under employment or change of control arrangements,
shall be entitled to severance benefits pursuant to FCB or FCLSs severance
plan or policy, as applicable, or BHLBs current severance plan or policy, if
such payments would be more favorable to such Person; _provided_ , _however_ ,
if such benefits pursuant to FCB or FCLSs plan or policy, as applicable, will
result in an excise tax under Code Section 4980D, such plan or policy shall be
modified to the extent necessary so as to avoid the imposition of such excise
tax and the affected participant under such plan or policy shall be paid an
additional amount such that his or her benefit, net applicable taxes, equals
the value of the benefit reduced or eliminated by such action.

 



 

7.5.8 _Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act_. If requested by
BHLB, FCB shall take all such actions as BHLB may request in order to fully
and timely comply with any and all requirements of both the federal Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" **WARN Act** ") and any
state specific WARN Act statutes, including providing notices to FCBs and FCB
Subsidiaries employees.

 



 

7.6 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 



 

7.6.1 Prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall obtain and fully pay the premium
for the extension of (i) the Side A coverage part (directors and officers
liability) of FCBs existing directors and officers insurance policies, and
(ii) FCBs existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or

 



      
 

 



 

discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as FCBs
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " **D andO
Insurance**" and such insurance carrier, the " **Insurance Carrier** ") with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as FCBs existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against any Person covered thereby that arose,
existed, or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall BHLB be required to
expend for such "tail" policy a premium amount in excess of an amount equal to
200% of the annual premiums paid by FCB for DandO Insurance in effect as of the
date of this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, FCB agrees, in order
for BHLB to fulfill its agreement, to provide the Insurance Carrier with such
representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of
any prior claims.

 



 

7.6.2 In addition to Section 7.6.1, BHLB shall, from and after the Effective
Date, to the fullest extent that would have been permitted to FCB under New
Jersey law and the FCB certificate of incorporation (to the extent not
prohibited by federal law), indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person
who is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes
before the Effective Time, an officer or director of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary
(the " **Indemnified Parties** ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written
consent of BHLB, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each, a " **Claim**
") in which an Indemnified Party is or is threatened to be made a party or
witness in whole or in part or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such Person is or was an Indemnified Party if such Claim pertains to any
matter of fact arising, existing, or occurring before the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
before, or after, the Effective Time. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.6.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall
notify BHLB (but the failure so to notify BHLB shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Section 7.6.2, except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices BHLB). In the event of any such Claim
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) BHLB shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and upon such assumption
BHLB shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if BHLB elects not
to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably
advises the Indemnified Parties that there are or may be (whether or not any
have yet actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest between
BHLB and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them, and BHLB shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent
otherwise required due to conflicts of interest, BHLB shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one (1) firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties unless there is a conflict of interest that necessitates
more than one law firm, and (3) BHLB shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

7.6.3 In the event that either BHLB or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of BHLB shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.6.

 



 

7.6.4 The obligations of BHLB provided under this Section 7.6 are intended to
be enforceable against BHLB directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of BHLB.

 



 

7.7 _Stock Listing._

 



 

BHLB agrees to file a notification form for the listing on the NYSE (or such
other national securities exchange on which the shares of BHLB Common Stock
shall be listed as of the Closing Date) of the shares of BHLB Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

7.8 _Reservation of Stock._

 



 

BHLB agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of BHLB Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

7.9 _Communications to FCB Employees; Training_

 



 

BHLB and FCB agree that as promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, meetings with employees of FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries shall
be held at such locations as BHLB and FCB shall mutually agree, provided that
representatives of FCB shall be permitted to attend such meetings. BHLB and
FCB shall mutually agree in advance as to the scope and content of all
communications to the employees of FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries. At mutually
agreed upon times following execution of this Agreement, representatives of
BHLB shall be permitted to meet with the employees of FCB and the FCB
Subsidiaries to discuss employment opportunities with BHLB, provided that
representatives of FCB shall be permitted to attend any such meeting. From and
after the first date on which all Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if
applicable) and the FCB Shareholder Approval necessary for the consummation of
the Merger (disregarding any waiting period) have been obtained, BHLB shall
also be permitted to conduct training sessions outside of normal business
hours or at other times as FCB may agree, with the employees of FCB and the
FCB Subsidiaries and may conduct such training seminars at any branch location
of FCB or loan production office of FCLS; provided that BHLB will in good
faith attempt to schedule such training sessions in a manner which does not
unreasonably interfere with FCBs or FCLSs normal business operations.

 



 

7.10 _Current Information._

 



 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, BHLB
will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with representatives
of FCB to inform FCB regarding BHLBs operations at such times as FCB may
reasonably request. BHLB will promptly notify FCB of any change in the
ordinary course of its business or in the operation of its properties and, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, of any governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be
contemplated), or the institution or the threat of material litigation
involving BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary.

 



 

7.11 _Access to Properties and Records._

 



 

Subject to Section 11.1, BHLB shall permit FCB access upon reasonable notice
and at reasonable times to its properties and those of the BHLB Subsidiaries,
and shall disclose and make available to FCB during normal business hours all
of its books and records relating to the assets, properties, operations,
obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of
account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors and shareholders meetings (other than minutes that discuss any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter
that BHLB reasonably determines should be kept confidential), organizational
documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings with any
regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any
other business activities or prospects in which FCB may have a reasonable
interest; _provided, however,_ that BHLB shall not be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure, in BHLBs reasonable judgment, would interfere with the
normal conduct of BHLBs business or would violate or prejudice the rights or
business interests or confidences of any customer or other Person or entity or
would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel or contravene any applicable law. BHLB shall
provide and shall request its auditors to provide FCB with such historical
financial information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as
FCB may reasonably request for Securities Law disclosure purposes. FCB shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with BHLBs
regular business operations during any such access to BHLBs property, books
and records. BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary shall permit FCB, at FCBs expense,
to (i) cause a Phase I environmental assessment to be performed at any
physical location owned or occupied by BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary and (ii)
cause an appraisal to be performed in respect of any real property owned by
BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary.

Subsidiaries made by its independent registered public accountants and copies
of all internal control reports submitted to BHLB by such accountants, or by
any other accounting firm rendering internal audit services, in connection
with each annual, interim or special audit of the books of BHLB and the BHLB
Subsidiaries made by such accountants.

 



 

7.12.2 As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents are filed with the MDOB, FRB or FDIC, BHLB will deliver to FCB
the BHLB Regulatory Report filed by BHLB or the Bank. Within twenty-five (25)
days after the end of each month, the Bank will deliver to FCB a consolidating
balance sheet and a consolidating statement of operations, without related
notes, for such month prepared in accordance with current financial reporting
practices, as well as a month-end and year to date comparison to budget.

 



 

7.12.3 BHLB promptly will advise upon receipt and permit review by FCB of any
inquiry or examination report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the
condition or activities of BHLB or the Bank.

REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS

 



 

8.1 _Meeting of Shareholders._

 



 

FCB will (i) take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene

the purpose of considering this Agreement and the Merger (the " **FCB
Shareholders Meeting** "), except as otherwise provided in this Section, (ii)
in connection with the solicitation of proxies with respect to the FCB
Shareholders Meeting, have its Board of Directors recommend approval of this
Agreement to the FCB shareholders; and (iii) cooperate and consult with BHLB
with respect to each of the foregoing matters. The Board of Directors of FCB
may fail to make such a recommendation referred to in clause (ii) above, or
withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation only if such Board of
Directors, after having consulted with and considered the advice of its
financial and legal advisors, has determined that the making of such
recommendation, or the failure to withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation, would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of such
directors under applicable law.

 



 

8.2 _Proxy Statement-Prospectus; Merger Registration Statement._

 



 

8.2.1 For the purposes (i) of registering BHLB Common Stock to be offered to

shall draft and prepare, and FCB shall cooperate in the preparation of, the
Merger Registration Statement, including a proxy statement and prospectus
satisfying all applicable requirements of applicable state securities and
banking laws, and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed
by FCB to the FCB shareholders, together with any and all amendments or
supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the " **Proxy Statement-
Prospectus** "). BHLB shall provide FCB and its counsel with appropriate
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and shall
incorporate all appropriate comments thereto, prior to the time it is
initially filed with the SEC or any amendments are filed with the SEC. BHLB
shall file the Merger Registration Statement, including the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus, with the SEC. Each of BHLB and FCB shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Merger Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and FCB shall
thereafter promptly mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders.
BHLB shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and FCB shall furnish all
information concerning FCB and the holders of FCB Common Stock as may be

time when the Merger Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the registration of the shares of BHLB Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Merger Registration Statement, or the initiation or threat of
any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Merger Registration Statement, or for
additional information, and BHLB will provide FCB with as many copies of such
Merger Registration Statement and all amendments thereto promptly upon the
filing thereof as FCB may reasonably request.

 



 

8.2.3 FCB and BHLB shall promptly notify the other party if at any time it
becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger Registration
Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. In such event, FCB shall cooperate with BHLB in the
preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus
that corrects such misstatement or omission, and BHLB shall file an amended
Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and FCB shall mail an amended
Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders.

 



 

8.3 _Regulatory Approvals._

 



 

Each of FCB and BHLB, and their respective Subsidiaries, will cooperate with
the other and use reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and as soon as
practicable following the date hereof but in no event later than August 31,
2016, file all necessary documentation to obtain all necessary permits,
consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of the MDOB, the NJDOBI, the
FDIC, the FRB, the SBA, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade
Commission and any other third parties and Governmental Entities or Bank
Regulators necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall BHLB or the Bank be
required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other requirement of any
Bank Regulator that would, in BHLBs or the Banks sole discretion (a)
prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by BHLB or the Bank of
all or any material portion of the business or assets of FCB or any FCB
Subsidiary, (b) compel BHLB or the Bank to dispose of or hold separate all or
any material portion of the business or assets of FCB or any FCB Subsidiary,
(c) impose a material compliance burden, penalty or obligation on BHLB or the
Bank resulting from noncompliance by FCB with its regulatory obligations,
including but not limited to its regulatory obligations as an SBA lender; or
(d) otherwise materially impair the value of FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries (any
such requirement alone, or more than one such requirement together, a
"Burdensome Condition"). FCB and BHLB will furnish each other and each others
counsel with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be
necessary or advisable in connection with any application, petition or other
statement made by or on behalf of FCB or BHLB to any Bank Regulator or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. FCB shall have the right to review and approve
in advance all characterizations of the information relating to FCB and any
FCB Subsidiary which appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Entity. In
addition, FCB and BHLB shall each furnish to the other for review a copy of
each such filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any Governmental Entity prior to its filing. Each of FCB and
BHLB will cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to

(except as otherwise indicated below):

 



 

10.1.1 At any time by the mutual written agreement of BHLB, the Bank and FCB;

 



 

10.1.2 By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in

cure the default; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1.2 unless the breach
of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the terminating party not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or
warranty by FCB) or Section 9.3.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation
or warranty by BHLB or the Bank);

the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party or its Subsidiaries, which failure by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the Closing Date or shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days
after written notice of such failure by the terminating party to the other
party, conditioned upon the defaulting party promptly commencing to cure the
default and thereafter continuing to cure; provided, however, that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1.3 unless the breach of covenant or agreement, together with all
other such breaches, would entitle the terminating party not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.2 (in the case of a breach
of covenant by FCB) or Section 9.3.2 (in the case of a breach of covenant by
BHLB or the Bank);

 



 

10.1.4 At the election of either party, if the Closing shall not have occurred
by the Termination Date, or such later date as shall have been agreed to in
writing by BHLB and FCB; provided, that no party may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.1.4 if the failure of the Closing to have occurred
on or before said date was due to such partys material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

10.1.5 By either party, if the shareholders of FCB shall have voted at the FCB
Shareholders Meeting on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
such vote shall not have been sufficient to approve and adopt such
transactions.

 



 

10.1.6 By either party if (i) final action has been taken by a Bank Regulator
whose approval is required in order to satisfy the conditions to the parties
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in
Article IX, which final action (x) has become unappealable and (y) does not
approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and unappealable;

 



 

10.1.7 By the Board of Directors of BHLB if each of the following conditions
are satisfied: (i) FCB has received a Superior Proposal and the Board of
Directors of FCB has entered into an acquisition agreement with respect to the
Superior Proposal, withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, has failed
to make such recommendation, or has modified or qualified its recommendation
in a manner adverse to BHLB, (ii) either (x) the Board of Directors of FCB
submits this Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation for
approval or (y) the Board of Directors of FCB withdraws, qualifies or
adversely modifies (or publicly proposes or resolves to

 



      
 

 



 

withdraw, qualify or adversely modify) its recommendation of this Agreement to
the FCB stockholders, and (iii) the FCB stockholders do not approve this
Agreement.

 



 

10.1.8 By the Board of Directors of FCB if FCB has received a Superior
Proposal and the Board of Directors of FCB has made a determination to accept
such Superior Proposal; provided that FCB shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.1.8 and enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to the Superior Proposal until the expiration of three (3) Business
Days following BHLBs receipt of written notice advising BHLB that FCB has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (and including a copy thereof with all accompanying
documentation, if in writing) identifying the Person making the Superior
Proposal and stating whether FCB intends to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to the Superior Proposal (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ").
After providing such Notice of Superior Proposal, FCB shall provide a
reasonable opportunity to BHLB during the three (3)-day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable FCB
to proceed with the Merger on such adjusted terms. Any material amendment of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and FCB
shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section
10.1.8; _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the three (3) Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period.

 



 

10.1.9 By the Board of Directors of FCB if it so determines by a majority vote
of the members of the entire Board of Directors of FCB, at any time during the
five-day period commencing on the Determination Date, such termination to be
effective on the 30th day following such Determination Date, if and only if
both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 



 

(1) The BHLB Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $21.52; and

 



 

(2) the number obtained by dividing the BHLB Market Value on the Determination
Date by the Initial BHLB Market Value shall be less than the number obtained
by dividing (x) the Final Index Price by (y) the Initial Index Price minus
0.20;

 



 

 _subject_ , _however_ , to the following three sentences.

 



 

If FCB elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section
10.1.9, it shall give prompt written notice thereof to BHLB. During the five
Business Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, BHLB shall
have the option of paying additional Merger Consideration by increasing the
Exchange Ratio to equal the number obtained by dividing (1) $15.54 by the
greater of (i) the product of 0.80 and the Initial BHLB Market Value or (ii)
the product obtained by multiplying the Index Ratio by the Initial BHLB Market
Value. If within such five Business Day period, BHLB delivers written notice
to FCB that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, then no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 10.1.9, and this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the
Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified and, thereafter, any reference in
this Agreement to "Merger Consideration" shall be deemed to refer to the
Merger Consideration reflecting the Exchange Ratio as modified pursuant to
this Section 10.1.9).

 



 

For purposes of this Section 10.1.9, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

 



 

" **Acquisition Transaction** " means (i) a merger or consolidation, or any

or other acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant

consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or
more of the voting power of the relevant companies; or (iv) agree or commit to
take any action referenced above.

NYSE for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding such specified
date.

 



 

" **Determination Date** " means the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals (and waivers, if applicable)

 



      
 

 



 

necessary for consummation of the Merger have been received (disregarding any
waiting period).

 



 

" **Index** " means the KBW Regional Bank Index.

 



 

" **Index Ratio** " means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index

the Index for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date

Determination Date.

 



 

If any company belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the
Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such company shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 10.1.9. If a
company belonging to the Index announces a sale between the date of this
Agreement and the Determination Date, such company shall be removed from the
Index and the relative weighting of the companies remaining in the Index shall
be appropriately adjusted.

11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.8, 11.9, 11.10, 11.11, and any other section which,
by its terms, relates to post-termination rights or obligations, shall survive
such termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect.

 



 

10.2.2 If this Agreement is terminated, expenses and damages of the parties
hereto shall be determined as follows:

 



 

(A) Except as provided below, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 



 

(B) In the event of a termination of this Agreement because of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
the breaching party shall remain liable for any and all damages, costs and
expenses, including all reasonable attorneys fees, sustained or incurred by
the non-breaching party as a result thereof or in connection therewith or with
respect to the enforcement of its rights hereunder.

 



 

(C) As used in this Agreement, " **Termination Fee** " shall mean $ **4.1
million**. As a condition of BHLBs willingness, and in order to induce BHLB
to enter into this Agreement, and to reimburse BHLB for incurring the costs
and expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, FCB hereby agrees to pay BHLB,
and BHLB shall be entitled to payment of, the Termination Fee by wire transfer
of same day funds on the earlier of (x) the date of termination or, if such

or

 



       
 

 



 

10.1.3 because of a breach by FCB or any FCB Subsidiary after the occurrence
of a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise
made known to the senior management or board of directors of FCB; or (ii) the
termination of this Agreement by BHLB and the Bank or FCB pursuant to Section
10.1.5 because of the failure of the shareholders of FCB to approve this
Agreement at the FCB Shareholders Meeting after the occurrence of an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise made known to
the shareholders of FCB.

 



 

(D) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
10.2.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, BHLB and the Bank would not
enter into this Agreement. The amount payable by FCB pursuant to this Section
10.2.2 constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy of such party in the event of termination of
this Agreement on the bases specified in such section.

 



 

10.3 _Amendment, Extension and Waiver._

 



 

Subject to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether

hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend this
Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies in the

pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to this Article X may only be effected upon a vote
of a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the terminating party.

integral part of this Agreement. References to sections include subsections,
which are part of the related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section

disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party
agrees that it will not seek and will agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with the other partys seeking or
obtaining such relief.
