of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement
or understanding or providing any other form of assistance) the initiation of
any inquiries or proposals regarding, or other action that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations in furtherance
of such inquiries or proposals or regarding an actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal or release any Person from, or fail to enforce, any confidentiality
or standstill agreement or similar obligation to Sunrise REIT or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, any

modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in
any manner adverse to the Purchasers, the approval or recommendation of the
Board (including any committee thereof) of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. 
---|--- 


   (2) | Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4.4(1), until the
Unitholder Approval, nothing shall prevent the Board from complying with
Sunrise REITÂ’s disclosure obligations under applicable Laws with regard to a
bona fide written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal or, following the receipt
of any such Acquisition Proposal from a third party (that did not result from
a breach of this Section 4.4), from furnishing or disclosing non-public
information to such Person if and only to the extent that: (i) the Board
believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal if consummated could reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and (ii) such third party has
entered into a confidentiality agreement containing terms in the aggregate no
more favorable to such third party than those in the
Confidentiality Agreement as are then in effect in accordance with its terms. 
---|--- 



   (3) |

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4.4(1), until the Unitholder
Approval, nothing shall prevent the Board from withdrawing or modifying,
or proposing publicly to withdraw or modify its approval and recommendation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or accepting, approving or
recommending or entering into any agreement, understanding or arrangement
providing for a bona fide written, unsolicited   

---|--- 



 

\- 18 -  Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this Section 4.4)
("Proposed Agreement") if and only to the extent that: (i) it has provided
the Purchasers with a copy of all of the documents relating to the Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) the Board, believes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and has promptly notified the Purchasers of
such determination, (iii) a period of at least five Business Days (the

Purchasers received written notice advising the Purchasers that the Board has
resolved, subject to compliance with this Section 4.4(3), to withdraw, modify
its approval and recommendation of the transactions contemplated by this

a copy of the documentation related to such Superior Proposal pursuant to
Section 4.4(3)(i), (iv) if the Purchasers have proposed to amend the

4.4(6), the Board has again made the determination in Section 4.4(3)(ii)

proposes to enter into a Proposed Agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 4.4(2)) after complying with this Section
4.4(3), Sunrise REIT shall have complied with Section 5.2 and 5.3. For the
purposes of this Section 4.4(3) the preparation and delivery of a directorsÂ’
circular pursuant to Section 99 of the Securities Act relating to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a qualification, withdrawal or
modification, of the BoardÂ’s recommendation of the transactions contemplated
hereby unless the Board expressly, and without qualification, reaffirms its
recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby in such disclosure. 

---|--- 



   (4) | If the expiry of the Matching Period referred to in Section

adjourn the Unitholder Meeting to a date that is not more than 10 Business
Days following such expiry date. 
---|--- 



   (5) | Sunrise REIT acknowledges and agrees that each successive
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of Section 4.4.  
---|--- 



   (6) |

During the Matching Period, the Purchasers shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to propose to amend the terms of this Agreement. The Trustees will
review any proposal by the Purchasers to amend the terms of this Agreement in
good faith in order to determine (after consultation with their financial
advisor and legal counsel) whether the transactions contemplated by   

---|--- 



 

\- 19 -  this Agreement, taking into account the PurchasersÂ’ proposed amendments
would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in the
Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the Trustees so
determine, Sunrise REIT will enter into an amending agreement with the
Purchasers reflecting such proposed amendment. 

---|--- 


   (7) | Sunrise REIT shall, as promptly as practicable, notify the
Purchasers of any relevant details relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or
inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendments to any Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the parties and all material terms thereof), or any request for
non-public information relating to Sunrise REIT or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that could reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, or for access to the
properties, books or records of Sunrise REIT or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Person that informs Sunrise REIT or such Subsidiary that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or inquiry that could reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, in each case which any of
Sunrise REIT, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer, trustee, director,
employee or Representative may receive after the date hereof relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Sunrise REIT shall promptly and fully keep the
Purchasers informed of the status on a current basis, including any change to
any of the terms, of any such Acquisition Proposal.

   (8) | Sunrise REIT shall (i) ensure that its officers and Trustees and
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors and any
Representatives retained by it or its Subsidiaries in connection herewith are
aware of the provisions of this Section 4.4, and Sunrise REIT shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 4.4 by its and its SubsidiariesÂ’
officers, directors, trustees or representatives; (ii) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) require all Persons other than the Purchasers who have been
furnished with confidential information regarding Sunrise REIT or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the solicitation of or discussion regarding
any Acquisition Proposal within 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly
to return or destroy such information, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into with such Persons; (iv)
terminate access for all Persons (other than the Purchasers and
its Representatives) of the electronic dataroom accessible through Merrill

its obligations under this Section 4.5 in respect of the Asset
PurchaserÂ’s obligations in Section 4.14(3) to assume Sunrise REITÂ’s
Liabilities under the Convertible Debentures if (i) the Asset Purchaser
arranges for a letter of credit to be issued as security for the full amount
of such assumed Liabilities, or (ii) Ventas causes its affiliates to
guarantee or otherwise secure such assumed Liabilities, in each case on terms
satisfactory to Sunrise REIT.

and until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, to
its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ properties, Books and Records and contracts as well
as to its management personnel (and to its property managers and their
personnel, who shall be instructed to co-operate), and, during such period,
Sunrise REIT shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and property
managers to) furnish promptly to the Purchasers all information concerning
it and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses, properties and personnel as the
Purchaser may reasonably request. The Purchasers, upon reasonable notice to
Sunrise REIT, at their expense, shall also have the right to prepare or cause

---|--- 



   (2) | Each of the Purchasers acknowledges that the information provided
to it under Section 4.4 and Section 4.6(1) above will be non-public and/or
proprietary in nature (the "Confidential Information") and will be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. For greater certainty, the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement, provided that the obligations of the Purchasers under the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 4.6(1) shall terminate following the
Closing Date, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained therein or
herein. 
---|--- 


 

\- 21 - Section 4.7 Insurance and Indemnities

shall not pay any premium in excess of US $800,000, plus GST. 
---|--- 



   (2) | From and after the Closing, the Purchasers shall indemnify the

in Schedule "E" and such indemnity shall, effective on Closing, replace and
supercede the existing indemnities from Sunrise REIT. 
---|--- 



   (3) | The provisions of this Section 4.7 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each individual referred to therein,
his or her heirs and successors and his or her legal representatives and, for

or on its registered or beneficial holders of Units as such, and that resort
shall not be had to, nor shall recourse be sought from, any of the foregoing
or the private property of any of the foregoing in respect of any
indebtedness, obligation or liability of the parties arising hereunder, and
recourse for such indebtedness, obligations or liabilities shall be limited
to, and satisfied only out of, the respective assets of Sunrise REIT. Any
obligation of Sunrise REIT set out in this Agreement shall, to the extent
necessary to give effect to such obligation, be deemed to constitute, subject
to the provisions of the previous sentence, an obligation of its trustees
in their capacity as Trustees and to the extent of the assets of Sunrise REIT
only.

Section 4.9 Anti-Dilution

For greater certainty, for purposes of this Agreement, the term "Units" shall
include all units or other securities into which Units may be, after the date

\- 22 -  liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization, merger, reorganization,
