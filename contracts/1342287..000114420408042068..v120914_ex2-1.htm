THIS  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " **Agreement** ")  dated  as of
July  28,  2008 is entered into by and among GENERAL  FINANCE
CORPORATION,  a  Delaware corporation (" **Parent** "),  GFN  NORTH 
AMERICA CORP., a  Delaware corporation (" **Sub** "),  PAC-VAN, INC., an
Indiana corporation (" **Pac-Van** "),  MOBILE OFFICE ACQUISITION CORP., a
Delaware corporation (" **MOAC** ")  (each  of MOAC and Pac-Van are referred
to individually as a " **Company** " and  collectively as the "
**Companies** "),  and  the stockholders of MOAC whose names appear in
_Exhibit  A_   attached  hereto (each a " **MOAC  Stockholder** " and 
collectively the " **MOAC  Stockholders** "),  with  reference to the
following facts:

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of MOAC has approved this Agreement and
determined  that  the merger of MOAC with and into Sub (the " **Merger**
"),  including the consideration to be paid for each of the outstanding
shares  (collectively, the " **Shares** ")  of (A)  Class A Common Stock of
MOAC (the " **Class  A MOAC Common Stock** ")  and  (B) Class B Common
Stock of MOAC (the " **Class  B MOAC Common Stock** ",  and  together with
the Class A Common Stock, the " **MOAC  Common Stock** ")  in the  Merger,
is fair and advisable to and in the best interests of MOAC and its 
stockholders;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" as
described in  Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " **Code** "),  and  this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan
of reorganization" within the  meaning of the regulations promulgated under
Section 368 of the  Code;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the duly appointed and authorized Special Committee of the Board of
Directors  of  Parent and the Board of Directors of Sub have approved, and
deem it fair  and  advisable and in the best interests of the disinterested
stockholders of  Parent,  to enter into, this Agreement and the Merger; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  the parties desire for the Merger to be a tax free reorganization
(except  to the  extent of cash and the Holdback Note (as defined below)
issuable pursuant  to  this Agreement) in accordance with the Code.

 

 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto  agree  as follows:

 

 

SECTION  1

 

**THE  MERGER**

 

 

Section  1.1 **The  Merger** **.**   Upon the  terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance  with  the Delaware General
Corporation Law (" **DGCL** "),  at  the Effective Time, the Merger shall be
consummated. As a result of the Merger,  the separate corporate existence of
MOAC shall cease and Sub shall continue  as  the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the " **Surviving  Corporation** ").  The  Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State  of 
Delaware.

 

 

Section  1.2 **Closing** **. ** Upon  the  terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing  of  the Merger (the "
**Closing** ")  shall  take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on a
date (the " **Closing  Date** ")  which  shall be the first business day
after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions  set forth in Article 6, other
than those conditions that by their nature  are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver  of  those conditions, at
the offices of Parent located at 39 East Union Street,  Pasadena, California
91103, or at such other time, date or place as agreed  to in  writing by the
parties hereto. Notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement  by  the
stockholders of MOAC, no agreement among the parties to change the place, 
time or date of the Closing shall require the approval of the stockholders 
of  MOAC.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1.3 **Effective  Time** **. ** On  the  Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated  by  filing the
certificate of merger (the " **Certificate  of Merger** ")  with  the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required  by, 
and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL. The 
date  and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of  State  of the State of Delaware (or such later time as shall be agreed
to by the  parties hereto and is specified in the Certificate of Merger) will
be the  " **Effective  Time.** "

 

 

Section  1.4 **Effects  of the Merger** **.**   The  Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the  DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,  at  the Effective
Time all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers  and 
franchises of MOAC and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all 
debts, liabilities and duties of MOAC and Sub shall become the debts, 
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section  1.5 **Certificate  of Incorporation; Bylaws**.

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time and without any further action on the part of
MOAC or Sub,  the  Certificate of Incorporation **** of  Sub as  amended
to date and as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall  be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until 
thereafter amended as provided therein and under the DGCL.

 

 

(b) At  the  Effective Time and without any further action on the part of
MOAC or Sub,  the  bylaws of Sub, as amended, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective  Time  shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
thereafter may be amended  or repealed in accordance with their terms or the
certificate of incorporation  of the Surviving Corporation and as provided
therein and under the  DGCL.

 

 

Section  1.6 **Directors  and Officers** **. ** At  the  Closing, the
bylaws of Sub shall specify that the board of directors of Sub  shall consist
of between three (3) and five (5) members and the directors  shall  be
elected by Parent to hold office in accordance with the certificate of 
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Sub 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of 
the  Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors
are  duly  elected or appointed and qualified.

(a) Upon  surrender by a MOAC Stockholder to Parent of the certificate
representing  the  shares held by such stockholder (each " **MOAC 
Certificate** ")  and  delivery of a letter of transmittal in form and
substance reasonably  satisfactory to Parent and the MOAC Stockholders and
instructions for use  in  effecting the surrender of the MOAC Certificates
for payment of the Merger  Consideration therefor immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation shall cause to be delivered to
each holder of a MOAC Certificate  (collectively with the Eligible Stock
Option Holder, " **Eligible  Stockholder** ")  the  portion of the Merger
Consideration to which such shares represented by such  MOAC Certificate are
entitled to receive in accordance with the allocation  set  forth in Section

Consideration** ")  less  any amounts required to be withheld under
Section  2.7 as  follows:

 

 

(i) At  the  Effective Time, the Cash and the Holdback Note; and

(b) Parent  shall retain possession of the Pledged Shares pursuant to the
terms and  conditions of the Pledge Agreement.

 

 

(c) Upon  the  delivery to Parent of the MOAC Certificates, the MOAC
Certificates shall  be  cancelled. Until so surrendered, each MOAC
Certificate will represent, from  and  after the Effective Time, only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger  Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 2.4(a).  No  interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the MOAC  Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of the  MOAC  Certificates. If payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be made  to  a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate  is  registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so  surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form  for  transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any  transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share  Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the  Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of  the  Surviving Corporation
that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.  As used in this
Agreement, " **Person** " means  an individual, corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, association,  trust, unincorporated
organization, other entity or group (as defined in  the  Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " **Exchange  Act** ")).

 

 

(d) In  the  event any MOAC Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent  shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed MOAC Certificates,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per  Share Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant  to  this Article 2.

 

 

(e) Immediately  prior to the Effective Time the Warrants shall be cancelled
and the holder  of  the Warrants shall receive the proceeds payable to
cancel the Warrants (which  equal the amount the holders of the Warrants
would have received if the Warrants  were exercised in connection with the
Merger) set forth in Section 2.1 of  the  Companies Disclosure Schedules
attached hereto.

of MOAC shall  be  closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers  of  shares of MOAC Common Stock on the records of
MOAC. From and after the Effective  Time, the holders of MOAC Certificates
evidencing ownership of Shares  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any  rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for  herein.

 

 

Section  2.5 **Dissenting  Shares** **.**

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by  stockholders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the
Merger and  who  shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such
shares of MOAC  Common Stock in the time and manner provided in Section 262
of the DGCL and  shall not have failed to perfect, and shall not have
effectively withdrawn  or  lost, their rights to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL (the " **Dissenting  Shares** ")  shall  not be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,  but shall be entitled
to receive the fair value of their Shares as shall  be  determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if  such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn  or  lost
his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such  holder's
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the later  of the
time of such failure to perfect, withdrawal or loss of right or the 
Effective Time, into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration 
set  forth in Section  2.4,  without  any interest thereon.

 

 

(b) MOAC  shall deliver to Parent prompt notice of any notices of intent to
assert  appraisal rights and to demand payment or withdrawals of notices of
intent  to  assert appraisal rights and to demand payment and will not,
except with the  prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle or compromise, offer
to settle or  compromise any such notices or voluntarily make any payment
with respect  to any  notice of intent to demand payment for Shares.

 

 

(c) After  the  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible for payment  with  respect to Dissenting Shares and for
compliance with Section 262 of the  DGCL.

 

 

Section  2.6 **No  Further Ownership Rights in MOAC Stock** **.**   All 
payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration made upon surrender of MOAC 
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have 
been  made in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
subject  to such  MOAC Certificate and there shall be no further
registration of transfers  on the  records of the Surviving Corporation of
Shares which were outstanding as  of the  Closing. If, after the Closing,
MOAC Certificates are presented to the Surviving  Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided  in  this SECTION 2.

 

 

Section  2.7 **Withholding  Taxes**.

 

 

(a) Each  of  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold  from the Per Share Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to an Eligible  Stockholder pursuant to Section 2.4 such  amounts as
Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and  withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under  any 
applicable provision of any law, statute, ordinance, rule, code, or
regulation  of any Governmental Authority (" **Law** ").  To  the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for  all 
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares 
or  MOAC Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction  and  withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation,  respectively.

Section  2.8 **Further  Action** **.**   At and  after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving  Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on  behalf  of MOAC, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take  and do,  in the

Corporation as a result  of,  or in connection with, the Merger.

Person to the MOAC Stockholders prior to such  termination.

 

 

Section  7.2 **Post-Closing  Indemnification** **.**

 

 

(a) _Indemnification  by MOAC Stockholders_.  From  and after the Closing,
and subject to the limitations herein, the MOAC  Stockholders, severally (in
the manner provided in Section 7.2(b)(iii) hereof)  but not jointly, shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Surviving Corporation,  Sub and Parent and
their directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,  successor and
assigns (each a " **Parent  Indemnified Person"** and,  collectively, the "
**Parent  Indemnified Persons** ")  for,  from, and against, and pay and
reimburse each Parent Indemnified Person for,  all  demands, claims, Actions
or causes of action, Orders, obligations, deficiencies,  proceedings (formal
or informal) assessments, Tax, losses, damages, liabilities,  costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, interest, penalties,  disbursements
and expenses (including any fees and costs of attorneys and  accountants) not
otherwise paid by or recovered from an applicable policy (or  policies) of
insurance (collectively, " **Losses** ")  (i)  arising out of the breach of
any representation or warranty of either of the  Companies contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) arising  out  of the breach by
either of the Companies, or the failure by either of the  Companies to
perform, any of the covenants or other agreements contained in  this 
Agreement or any other agreement executed by either of the Companies in 
connection with this Agreement to be performed by either of the Companies
prior  to or at the Closing, or arising out of a breach, or failure to
perform by  a  MOAC Stockholder of any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this  Agreement or any other agreements executed by such MOAC
Stockholder, or (iii)  provided that written notice of such claim is
delivered to the MOAC Stockholders  prior to twenty (20) months after the
Closing Date, relating to any liabilities  or obligations of either of the
Companies, whether known, unknown, contingent  or  otherwise, (A) owed for

liabilities or obligations disclosed in the Companies Disclosure  Schedules,
accrued liabilities included in the calculation of the Working  Capital set
forth in the Working Capital Certificate, forward commitments to  purchase
rental fleet set forth in the Companies Disclosure Schedules and any 
contingent liability under any Contract entered into prior to the Closing
which  arises solely due to events which occur after the Closing. With 
respect to any Losses potentially recoverable under a policy or policies of 
insurance of Pac-Van, Pac-Van will make a claim with respect thereto under
the  applicable insurance policy or policies if the Losses in question are
covered  in  whole or in part by such insurance policy or policies. If  a
MOAC  Stockholder pays a Loss which is subsequently also paid under such
insurance,  then Parent will reimburse such MOAC Stockholder for payment of
the insured  Loss  up to the amount it receives from the insurance company
less expenses and fees  incurred in connection with obtaining such payments
from the insurer, but only  if there are no pending indemnification claims.
Notwithstanding anything to  the  contrary contained herein, the MOAC
Stockholders shall have no indemnification  obligation of any kind for any
taxes payable by Pac-Van or the Surviving  Corporation as a result of the
Merger.

(b) _Limitations  on Indemnity by MOAC Stockholders_.  If any  Parent
Indemnified Person becomes potentially entitled to any indemnification  for
Losses pursuant to Section  7.2(a)  of this  Agreement, the amount that
such Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to recover  in connection
therewith shall nevertheless be limited as follows:

 

 

(i) No  Losses  shall be payable for a claim under Section 7.2(a) until the
total of all Losses  under claims under Section 7.2(a) exceed $500,000 (the "
**Deductible** "),  it  being understood that all Losses shall accumulate
until such time or times  as  the aggregate of Losses exceed the Deductible,
whereupon the Parent Indemnified  Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for all Losses including  those up to the
Deductible; provided,  however, the Deductible shall not apply to Losses
relating to a breach of any  representation and warranty which constitutes
fraud or involves intentional  tortious conduct, and

 

 

(ii) The  maximum amount payable by each MOAC Stockholder for Losses under
Section 7.2(a)  shall be (A) the value of the Pledged Shares, if any, issued
to such MOAC  Stockholder (assuming a per share price of $7.50) and (B) the
principal amount  of the Holdback Note, if any, issued to such MOAC
Stockholder; provided,  however, the maximum amount payable by each MOAC
Stockholder for Losses under  Section 7.2(a) related to claims for a breach
of a Company Excluded  Representation or a breach of any representation and
warranty which constitutes  fraud or involves intentional tortious conduct
shall be the sum of (1) the  value  of the Parent Common Stock, if any,
issued to such MOAC Stockholder (assuming  a  per share price of $7.50) plus
(2) the principal amount of the Holdback Note,  if  any, issued to such MOAC
Stockholder plus (3) the portion of Cash paid to such  MOAC Stockholder.

 

 

(iii) Claims  for Losses by a Parent Indemnified Person shall be payable pro-
rata by each  MOAC  Stockholder based on the ratio of the maximum amount
payable by such MOAC  Stockholder for the type of claim at issue to the
maximum amounts payable by  all  MOAC Stockholders for the type of claim at
issue. In addition, no MOAC  Stockholder shall have any liability or
obligations for any covenant of, or  a  breach by, another MOAC Stockholder
hereunder or under any agreement executed  in  connection herewith.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  addition, the disclosure of any act, omission or event in this Agreement,
or  in  any Schedule, Companies Disclosure Schedules or Exhibit of this
Agreement,  or in  any agreement executed in connection with this Agreement,
shall not be a defense  to a MOAC Stockholder from, or serve as any
limitation on any Parent Indemnified  Person to make, claims under Section
7.2(a)(ii), nor shall any knowledge or  information of, or acquired by or on
behalf of, Parent or Sub through due  diligence from, or serve as any
limitation on any Parent Indemnified Person  to  make, claims under this
Agreement.

 

 

(c) _Indemnification  by Parent_.  From  and after the Closing, and subject
to the limitations herein, Parent shall  indemnify and hold harmless each
MOAC Stockholder and his or its respective  shareholders, partners,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,  successors and assigns
(each a " **Company  Indemnified Person** " and,  collectively, the "
**Company  Indemnified Persons** ")  for,  from, and against, and pay and
reimburse each Company Indemnified Person for,  all Losses (i) arising out of
the breach of any representation or warranty  of  Parent or Sub contained in
or made pursuant to this Agreement (except as  provided in this last sentence
of this subsection (c)), (ii) arising out of  the  breach by Parent or Sub,
or the failure by Parent, Sub or Surviving Corporation  to perform, any of
the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement  or any other
agreement executed by Parent, Sub or Surviving Corporation in  connection
with this Agreement to be performed by Parent, Sub or Surviving  Corporation
prior to, at or after the Closing or (iii) arising out any claim  brought by
a stockholder of Parent (other than a party issued Parent Common  Stock
pursuant to this Agreement) relating to the Merger, other than any of  the 
following claims, for which Parent will have no duty to indemnify any
Company  Indemnified Person: any claim arising in connection with fraud,
intentional  tortious conduct or an allegation that either of the Companies
or any officer,  director, stockholder or employee of either of the Companies
provided  information in Companies Disclosure Schedules or the Revised
Companies  Disclosure Schedule or information used in or in the preparation
of the Proxy  Statement which contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or which  omitted any material fact necessary in order to make such
statements not  misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent shall not  have any obligation to indemnify Ronald F. Valenta ("
**Valenta** ")  or  Kaiser Investments Limited with respect to any breach of
the representations  set  forth in Section 4.9 hereof. No stockholder of
MOAC other than the MOAC  Stockholders shall have any obligation under this
Agreement to indemnify any  Parent Indemnified Person.

 

 

(d) _Limitations  on Indemnity by Parent_.  If any  Company Indemnified
Person becomes potentially entitled to any indemnification  for Losses
pursuant to Section 7.2(c) of this Agreement, the amount that such  Company
Indemnified Person is entitled to recover in connection therewith shall 
nevertheless be limited as follows:

 

 

(i) Other  than with respect to breaches of payment obligations under Article
2 or with  respect to claims under 7.2(c)(iii), first, no Losses shall be
payable for  a  claim under Section 7.2(c)(i) or (ii) until the total of all
Losses under claims  under Section 7.2(c)(i) or (ii) exceed the Deductible,
it being understood  that  all Losses shall accumulate until such time or
times as the aggregate of Losses  exceed the Deductible, whereupon the
Company Indemnified Persons shall be  entitled to indemnification hereunder
for all Losses including those up to  the  Deductible; provided, however,
the Deductible shall not apply to Losses relating  to a breach of any
representation and warranty which constitutes fraud or  involves intentional
tortious conduct.

 

 

(ii) Other  than with respect to breaches of payment obligations under
Article 2 or with  respect to claims under 7.2(c)(iii), the maximum amount
payable by Parent and  Sub to each stockholder of MOAC for Losses under
Section 7.2(c) shall be (A)  the  value of the Pledged Shares, if any,
issued to such MOAC Stockholder (assuming  a  per share price of $7.50) and
(B) the principal amount of the Holdback Note,  if  any, issued to such MOAC
Stockholder; provided, however, the maximum amount  payable by Parent and Sub
for Losses under Section 7.2(c) related to claims  for  a breach of a Parent
Excluded Representation or a breach of any representation  and warranty which
constitutes fraud or involves intentional tortious conduct  shall be the sum
of (1) the value of the Parent Common Stock, if any, issued  to  such MOAC
Stockholder (assuming a per share price of $7.50) plus (2) the  principal
amount of the Holdback Note, if any, issued to such MOAC Stockholder  plus
(3) the portion of Cash, if any, paid to such MOAC  Stockholder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  addition, the disclosure of any act, omission or event in this Agreement,
or  in  any Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, or in any agreement
executed in  connection herewith shall not be a defense to Parent from, or
serve as any  limitation on any Company Indemnified Person to make, claims
under Section  7.2(c)(ii), nor shall any knowledge or information of, or
acquired by or on  behalf of, a MOAC Stockholder through due diligence or
otherwise be a defense  to  Parent from, or serve as any limitation on any
Company Indemnified Person to  make, claims under this Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.3 **Payments  of Losses** **. **

 

 

(a) All  Losses set forth in the Claim Notice provided to a MOAC Stockholder
shall be  paid first, by an offset against the unpaid principal amount of the
Holdback  Note (if any) issued to such MOAC Stockholder and then, by the
surrender and  cancellation of Parent Common Stock pledged pursuant to the
Pledge Agreement  with such Parent Common Stock being valued at $7.50 per
share for the purpose  of  determining the amount of Parent Common Stock to
be surrendered and cancelled  to  satisfy the indemnification obligations of
the MOAC Stockholder (however, in  lieu of such surrender of Parent Common
Stock, the MOAC Stockholder may pay  the  Losses in cash). If the claim in a
Claim Notice is not a Disputed Claim, the  Losses set forth in such Claim
Notice shall be payable at the end of the  Objection Period. If the claim in
a Claim Notice is a Disputed Claim as to  an  Indemnifying Person, payment
of all amounts determined pursuant to Section  7.4(a) to be owed by such
Indemnifying Person to an Indemnified Person shall  be  made within five
days after the earlier of (1) delivery of written notice by  such
Indemnifying Person admitting the indemnification claim described in a  Claim
Notice, (2) the making of a binding agreement approved by such an 
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person, or (3) the determination of 
such  liability and amount by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary  contained herein, whether or not a Third Party Claim is a Disputed
Claim, if  no  MOAC Stockholder has assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim to which Section  7.2(a) applies, the Parent Indemnified Persons, at
their election, shall be  entitled to offset against the Pledged Shares and
unpaid principal amount of  the  Holdback Note issued to each MOAC
Stockholder the portion of the fees and costs,  including attorneys\' fees
and costs, incurred by an Indemnified Person to defend  such Third Party
Claim, whether or not suit is brought. All payments of Losses  are subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 7.2(b).

 

 

(b) No  payments under the Holdback Note shall limit in any way the
obligations of  the  MOAC Stockholders who receive such payments to
indemnify Parent Indemnified  Persons pursuant to this Article 7.

 

 

(c) If  a MOAC  Stockholder pays Losses under this Agreement, such MOAC
Stockholder shall be  subrogated to, and shall be entitled to enforce (or
cause either Company or  the  Surviving Corporation to enforce) any rights,
remedies or claims either Company  or the Surviving Corporation may have
under the Merger Agreement dated July  12,  2006 among MOAC, PVI Acquisition
Corporation, Pac-Van, Brent Claymon, Scott  Claymon and Matthew Claymon (the
" **Claymon  Agreement** ");  provided, however, if paying Losses would
prejudice the rights to make a claim  under the Claymon Agreement, then, if
requested by a MOAC Stockholder, Pac  Van  or the Surviving Corporation
shall bring an Action for indemnity under the  Claymon Agreement on the
conditions that (i) the MOAC Stockholder deposits  an  amount equal to its
share of the Losses in question in an escrow mutually  acceptable to Parent
and such MOAC Stockholder pending resolution of the claim  for indemnity
under the Claymon Agreement, (ii) such MOAC Stockholder shall  indemnify
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective directors, 
officers and affiliates for all Losses incurred in connection with such
Action  and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall select counsel for such
Action,  provided such counsel is reasonably acceptable to such MOAC
Stockholder. The  costs and expenses incurred by either Company or the
Surviving Corporation  in  bringing a claim against the Claymons at the
request of a MOAC Stockholders  under this clause shall be paid severally,
and not jointly and severally, by  the  requesting MOAC Stockholders if not
paid by the Claymons pursuant to the Claymon  Agreement.

Section  7.4 **Procedures** **.**

 

 

(a) For  purposes hereof, a " **Third  Party Claim** "  is a  claim
asserted against an Indemnified Person by a person other than a party  to 
this Agreement. A Person that has (or believes that it has) a claim for 
indemnification under this Article  7  (" **Indemnified  Person** ") 
shall  give written notice to the person who has the indemnification
obligation (each,  an " **Indemnifying  Person** " and  collectively, the
" **Indemnifying  Persons** ")  (a " **Claim  Notice** "),  requesting
indemnification and describing in reasonable detail to the extent  then known
the nature of the indemnification claim being asserted by the  Indemnified
Person, providing therein an estimate of the amount of Losses  attributable
to the claim to the extent feasible (which estimate may be but  shall not
necessarily be conclusive of the final amount of such claim), and  also 
providing therein the basis for and factual circumstances surrounding the 
Indemnified Person's request for indemnification under this Article  7; 
provided, however, if the claim relates to a breach of an obligation by one 
Indemnifying Person only, then the Claim Notice only needs to be delivered 
to  such Indemnifying Person. A copy of all papers served on or received by
the  Indemnified Person with respect to a Third Party Claim, if any, shall
be  attached to the Claim Notice. The failure of an Indemnified Person to
properly  deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Person with respect to a
Third Party  Claim shall not defeat or prejudice the indemnification rights
under this  Article 7 of such Indemnified Person with respect to the related
Third Party  Claim unless and except to the extent that the resulting delay
is materially  prejudicial to the defense of the Third Party Claim or the
amount of Losses  associated therewith. The Indemnifying Persons to whom a
Claim Notice is  delivered shall, within twenty (20) days (or 15 days if the
claim is a Third  Party Claim) after delivery of a Claim Notice (the
"Objection Period") to them,  deliver written notice to the Indemnified
Person whether such Indemnifying  Person admits or disputes the claim
described in the Claim Notice, and in the  case of a Third Party Claim,
whether the Indemnifying Person (or Persons) will  assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Person to whom  a  Claim Notice is
delivered notifies the Indemnified Person in writing that he  disputes such
claim for indemnification, or that he admits the entitlement  of  the
Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article  7  with  respect
thereto but disputes the amount of the Losses in connection therewith,  prior
to the expiration of the Objection Period, then as to such Indemnifying 
Person the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice shall be a 
disputed indemnification claim (a " **Disputed  Claim** ")  that  must be
resolved by an agreement between such Indemnifying Person and Parent  or  by
arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.

 

 

(b) If  any  Indemnifying Person elects prior to the expiration of the
Objection Period  in a  written notice to the Indemnified Person who
delivered the Claim Notice to  assume the defense of a Third Party Claim,
then (i) the Indemnifying Persons  shall vigorously defend the Third Party
Claim with counsel approved by the  Indemnified Person (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld), and  (ii)  the Indemnifying Persons shall not
enter into any settlement of the Third Party  Claim unless such settlement is
approved in writing by the Indemnified Person  (which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no Indemnifying  Person elects prior to
the expiration of the Objection Period in a written  notice to the
Indemnified Person who delivered the Claim Notice to assume the  defense of a
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Person may defend the  Third  Party
Claim with counsel of its choice and may enter into a settlement thereof 
without seeking or obtaining approval of the Indemnifying Persons as to
counsel  employed or for the making of such settlement.

 

 

Section  7.5 **Exclusive  Post-Closing Remedy** **.**   After  the
Closing, and except for any non-monetary, equitable relief to which any 
Indemnified Person may be entitled, the rights and remedies set forth in
this  Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights and remedies
of the  Indemnified Persons under or with respect to the matters subject to 
indemnification under Section  7.2  of this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  7.6 **Liability  Limitations** **.**   In no  event shall any
Indemnified Person be, under or in respect of this Agreement  (but not with
respect to matters appropriately pursued outside of the provisions  of this
Agreement), entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages. Except  to 
the extent of a claim for fraud or intentional tortious conduct, which
claims  are not released by any party hereunder, Parent, Sub and the
Companies hereby  waive as to each former officer and director of the
Companies, from and after  the Closing, any and all claims and causes of
action for any breach or alleged  breach of fiduciary obligation by such
officer or director to the Companies  or  its stockholders which arise
directly from the transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement. Further,
effective at the Effective Time, each of the MOAC  Stockholders, in his or
its capacity as a stockholder of the MOAC, hereby waives  any claims he or it
may have, as a stockholder of the Companies as of the  Effective Time,
against the Companies or their board of directors or officers,  including
under any Law.

 

 

SECTION  8

 

**TERMINATION**

 

 

Section  8.1 **Termination** **.** **** This  Agreement may be terminated

Directors of the  Companies, Sub and Parent;

 

 

(b) by  either  Company or Parent if:

 

 

(i) the  Merger has not been consummated by November 1, 2008 (the "

terminate this Agreement under this Section  8.1(b)(i)  shall  not be
available to any party whose failure to perform any covenant or  obligation,
or breach of a representation and warranty, under this Agreement  has  been

such date;  or

 

 

(ii) a  permanent injunction or other similar order of a court of competent
jurisdiction  or other competent Governmental Authority, in each case located
in the United  States, preventing the consummation of the transactions

Agreement  pursuant to this clause shall have used reasonable best efforts to
resist,  resolve or lift, as applicable, such injunction or other similar 
order;

 

 

(c) by  the  Companies:

 

 

(i)   if a  breach  by Parent or Sub of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement  contained in this Agreement shall have occurred, which
breach, in the aggregate  with all other such breaches, if any, would give
rise, to a failure of the  conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b)
hereof and which is not cured  within thirty (30) days following written
notice to the party committing such  breach or by its nature or timing cannot
be cured by the Outside Date;  or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) since  December 31, 2007, there shall have been any material adverse
change in the  financial condition or results of operations, assets or
liabilities of  Parent.

 

 

(d) by  Parent:

 

 

(i) if  a  breach by either of the Companies of any representation,
warranty, covenant  or  agreement contained in this Agreement shall have
occurred, which breach, in  the  aggregate with all other such breaches, if
any, would give rise to a failure  of  the conditions set forth in Section 
6.2(a)  or Section  6.2(b)  hereof  and cannot be cured by and which is
not cured within thirty (30) days following  written notice to the party
committing such breach or by its nature or timing  cannot be cured by the
Outside Date; or

 

 

(ii) since  December 31, 2007, a material adverse change in the financial
condition,  operating profits, backlog, assets, liabilities, operations,
business prospects,  applicable regulations, employee relations or customer
or supplier relations  of  either of the Companies has occurred; or

 

 

(iii) the  requisite approval of the stockholders of Parent to the Proposals
shall not  have  been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting.

 

 

Section  8.2 **Notice  of Termination; Effect of Termination** **.**

 

 

(a) _Notice  of Termination_.  The  party hereto desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section  8.1  shall  give written notice of such
termination to the other party, specifying the  provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is affected.

 

 

(b) _Effect  of Termination_.  If this  Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section  8.1,  this  Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability on the part  of  any party hereto, except that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section  8.2,  Section  8.3,  Article  VIII and in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination hereof  and (ii) no
such termination shall relieve any party of any liability or  damages
resulting from any breach by that party of this Agreement.

Section 8.3 of the Companies Disclosures Schedules  which will be borne by
Parent or as agreed by the parties in writing, all fees,  costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring  such fees, cost or
expense whether or not the Merger is consummated. If the  Merger is not

deemed a waiver by such party of any such rights, remedies,  powers or
privileges, even if such delay or failure is continuous or repeated.  No

THIS  PLEDGE AGREEMENT (this " **Pledge  Agreement** ")  is  made and

pledgors (each, individually a " **Pledgor** " and,  collectively, the "
**Pledgors** "),  GENERAL FINANCE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("
**Parent** "),  and  GFN NORTH AMERICA CORP., a Delaware corporation ("
**Sub** " and  collectively with Parent, the " **Buyers** ").

 

 

_**W** **I** **T** **N** **E** **S** **S** **E** T **H** **:**_

 

 

WHEREAS,  pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
**Merger  Agreement** ")  dated  July 22, 2008 by and among Buyers, PAC-
VAN, INC., an Indiana corporation  (" **Pac-Van** "),  MOBILE OFFICE
ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation (" **MOAC** ")  and  the Pledgors,
MOAC has been merged with and into Sub (the " **Merger** "),  and  each
Pledgor will receive the shares of common stock of Parent set forth on 
_Schedule  I_   hereto  (as to each Pledgor, the " **Pledged  Shares**
"),  other  shares of common stock of Parent not subject to this Agreement
and other  consideration in exchange for their stock in MOAC;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the Merger Agreement requires that each Pledgor pledge the Pledged
Shares in  favor of Buyers to secure the payment of the indemnification
obligations of  such  Pledgor under Article 7 of the Merger Agreement; and

 

 

WHEREAS,  Buyers have required, as a condition to entering into the Merger
Agreement,  that  Pledgors (i) pledge to Buyers, and grant to Buyers a
security interest in,  the Pledged Collateral (as defined herein) and (ii)
execute and deliver  this Pledge Agreement in order to secure the payment by
each Pledgor of its  Secured Obligations.

 

 

**AGREEMENT**

 

 

NOW  THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to induce
Buyers to  enter into the Merger Agreement, each Pledgor hereby agrees with
Buyers as  follows:

 

 

SECTION  1  Defined Terms. **The  following terms shall have the following
respective  meanings:**

 

 

" **Additional  Shares** " has  the  meaning specified in Section 8(b)
hereof.

 



 

" **Pledged  Collateral** " has  the  meaning specified in Section 2
hereof.

 



 

" **Pledged  Shares** " has  the  meaning specified in the recitals
hereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

" **Secured  Obligations** " has  the  meaning specified in Section 2
hereof.

 



 

" **Securities  Act** " has  the  meaning specified in Section 12 hereof.

 



 

" **UCC** " has  the  meaning specified in Section 3 hereof.

 



 

All  other  capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the  meanings given in the Merger Agreement, or, if not defined
therein, the meanings  set forth in the UCC, except where the context
otherwise requires.

 



 

SECTION  2  **Pledge**. **** Each  Pledgor hereby pledges to Buyers, for
their benefit, and grants to each Buyer,  for their benefit, a continuing
first priority and perfected security interest  in, its right, title and
interest in and to the following (collectively, the  "Pledged Collateral"):

 

 

(a)  the  Pledged Shares of such Pledgor, the Additional Shares applicable
to such  Pledgor\'s Pledged Shares and any certificates representing the
Pledged Shares  of  such Pledgor and/or the Additional Shares applicable to
such Pledgor\'s Pledged  Shares; and

 

 

(b)  the  proceeds (equal to $7.50 per share) of any sale of the Pledged
Shares of such  Pledgor and/or the Additional Shares applicable to such
Pledgor\'s Pledged  Shares.

 

 

SECTION  3  **Security  For Obligations**. **** As  to  each Pledgor,
this Pledge Agreement secures, and the Pledged Collateral of  such  Pledgor
is collateral security for, the prompt payment in full when due of  all 
Losses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) payable to Buyers from such
Pledgor  now or hereafter existing under Article 7 of the Merger Agreement
and all  amendments, extensions or renewals thereof (all such obligations
under Article  7  of the Merger Agreement being collectively referred to
herein as the "Secured  Obligations"). Cancellation of shares included in the
Pledged Collateral shall  be done solely in accordance with Section 7.3 of
the Merger Agreement. If a  Pledgor pays a Secured Obligation in cash in lieu
of permitting Buyers to retain  Pledged Shares as payment of such Secured
Obligation, the number of shares  included in the Pledged Collateral
(assuming a $7.50 value per share) equal  to  the cash payment made by such
Pledgor shall no longer be pledged to Buyers  and  Buyers shall promptly
deliver to such Pledgor the certificates for such shares  with the legend
relating to this Pledge Agreement removed therefrom. ****

 

 

SECTION  4  **Delivery  Of Pledged Collateral.** All  certificates or
instruments representing or evidencing the Pledged Collateral  shall be
delivered to and held by or on behalf of the Buyers pursuant hereto.  Such
certificates or instruments shall be in suitable form for transfer by 
delivery, or shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer or assignment 
in  blank (or such other documents or agreements necessary to give Buyers
"control" within the meaning of the UCC (as defined below)), all in form and
substance  reasonably satisfactory to Buyers. "UCC" means the Uniform
Commercial Code, as  in effect from time to time, of the State of Delaware or
of any other state  the  laws of which are required as a result thereof to
be applied in connection  with  the issue of perfection of security
interests in the Pledged Collateral;  _provided_ ,  _that_   to the 
extent that the UCC is used to define any term herein or in any other
documents  and such term is defined differently in different Articles or
Divisions of  the  UCC, the definition of such term contained in Article or
Division 9 shall  govern.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  5  **Representations  And Warranties**.  Each  Pledgor
represents and warrants as to the Pledged Collateral pledged by it  as 
follows:

 

 

(a) Such  Pledgor is the legal and beneficial owner of the Pledged Collateral
pledged  by  it, free and clear of any Lien on the Pledged Collateral.

 

 

(b) Upon  the  delivery to Buyers of the Pledged Collateral pledged by such
Pledgor and the  filing of a UCC-1 financing statement, the pledge of such
Pledged Collateral  pursuant to this Pledge Agreement will create a valid and
perfected first  priority Lien in such Pledged Collateral securing the
payment of such Pledgor's  Secured Obligations for the benefit of Buyers.

 

 

(c) No  authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with,  any Governmental Authority is required either for the pledge by
such Pledgor  of  Pledged Collateral pursuant to this Pledge Agreement or
for the execution,  delivery or performance of this Pledge Agreement by such
Pledgor.

 

 

(d) Such  Pledgor has full power and authority to enter into this Pledge
Agreement and  has  the right to pledge and grant a security interest in the
Pledged Shares pledged  by it and the other Pledged Collateral pledged by it,
in each case as provided  by this Pledge Agreement.

 

 

(e) This  Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by such  Pledgor and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable  against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability
may be limited  by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
moratorium or other  laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and by general  equitable principles.

 

 

SECTION  6  **Further  Assurances**. **** Each  Pledgor agrees that at any
time and from time to time, at its expense, it will  promptly execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all stock  powers,
assignments, acknowledgments, financing statements, instruments and 
documents and take all further action, at the Buyers' request, that Buyers 
reasonably deem necessary or advisable in order to perfect any security
interest  granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable Buyers to
exercise and  enforce their rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any
Pledged  Collateral pledged by such Pledgor and to carry out the provisions
and purposes  hereof. Each Pledgor will, promptly upon request, provide to
Buyers all  information and evidence it may reasonably request concerning the
Pledged  Collateral pledged by such Pledgor to enable Buyers to enforce the
provisions  of  this Pledge Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  7  Voting Rights; Sale Proceeds.

 

 

(a) Each  Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other
consensual  rights pertaining to the Pledged Shares pledged by such Pledgor
or any part  thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this
Pledge  Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  Pledgor shall
exercise or shall refrain from exercising any such right if such  action or
inaction could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the  validity,
priority or perfection of the security interests granted hereunder  or 
would otherwise be inconsistent with or violate any provisions of this
Pledge  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Any  and  all cash or other proceeds (equal to $7.50 per share) paid,
payable or otherwise  distributed in redemption of, or in exchange for, any
Pledged Shares, shall  in  each case be delivered forthwith to an escrow
agent pursuant to an escrow  agreement, both of which shall be mutually
satisfactory to the selling Pledgor  and Buyers to hold as Pledged Collateral
and shall, if received by a Pledgor,  be  received in trust for the benefit
of the Buyers, be segregated from the other  property or funds of such
Pledgor, and be forthwith delivered to such escrow  as  Pledged Collateral
in the same form as so received (with any necessary or  requested
endorsement). The selling Pledgors shall bear all fees and costs  of  such
escrow. Any amounts received paid, payable or otherwise distributed in 
redemption of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Shares in excess of $7.50 per 
share shall be retained by the selling Pledgor and shall not be subject to 
this  Agreement in any manner.

 

 

SECTION  8  Transfers And Other Liens; Additional Shares.

 

 

(a) Each  Pledgor agrees that it will not (i) sell or otherwise dispose of,
or grant  any  option with respect to, any of the Pledged Collateral unless
the proceeds of  such sale up to $7.50 per share are delivered to escrow
pursuant to Section  6(b)  and such sale is made in accordance with the
Stockholders Agreement of even  date  herewith among Pledgors, Parent and
other persons named therein; (ii) create  or  permit to exist any Lien upon
or with respect to any of the Pledged Collateral,  except for the security
interest granted under this Pledge Agreement; or (iii)  enter into any
agreement or understanding that purports to or may restrict  or  inhibit
Buyers' rights or remedies hereunder, including, without limitation,  Buyers'
right to retain the Pledged Collateral. In connection with any sale of  the
Pledged Collateral in accordance with clause (i) of this subsection, Buyers 
shall deliver to the selling Pledgor the certificates for the Pledged
Collateral  being sold.

 

 

(b)   Each  Pledgor agrees that it will deliver to Buyers hereunder,
promptly upon its  acquisition thereof, any and all additional shares of
stock received as a result  of a split or subdivision of such Pledgor's
Pledged Shares (" **Additional  Shares "**).

 

 

SECTION  9  **Buyers  May Perform**. **** If  any  Pledgor fails to

Agreement shall terminate on the third anniversary of the date  hereof (the "

THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION  SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING,  THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE

THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER  PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS,
IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR  ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS
PLEDGE AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION  HEREOF OR THEREOF.

party hereto, or the affiliates, directors, officers, officers, employees, 
or  agents of such parties, for punitive damages in respect of any claim for
breach  of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or
related to the  transactions contemplated by this Pledge Agreement or the
Merger Agreement,  or  any act, omission or event occurring in connection

or otherwise) or (ii)  Maker fails to make any payment of interest, premium,
if any, fees, costs,  expenses or other amounts due hereunder within three
(3) Business Days after  the  date when due, then Maker shall pay interest
on the unpaid principal balance  of  and accrued and unpaid interest on this
Note at a rate per annum (the  " ** _Default  Rate_** ")  equal  to twelve
(12%) from the date that an Event of Default commences until such  time  as
such Event of Default is cured or waived; provided, however, in the case 
of  an Event of Default under clause (i) the Default Rate shall be equal to
fourteen  percent (14%).

 

 

(c) Interest  payable under this Note shall accrue from and including the
date of issuance  through and until repayment of the principal and payment of
all accrued interest  and premium, if any, in full. All interest payable
under this Note shall accrue  on a semi-annual basis and be computed on the
basis of a three hundred sixty  (360)-day year of twelve (12) thirty (30)-day
months.

 

 

2. _Prepayments_.  

 

 

(a) Maker  may  prepay the unpaid principal balance of this Note at any
time. Any prepayment  of  this Note under this _Section  3_   shall  also
include all accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal  balance
of this Note through and including the date of prepayment.

 

 

(b)   If any  of the following conditions occurs and is continuing, the
Holder, by notice  to  Maker, may declare the principal of and accrued
interest on the Note to be  immediately due and payable: (i) General Finance
shall cease to own and control  at least 100% of the outstanding all 
shares, interests, participations or other equivalents (however designated, 
whether voting or non-voting) of Maker's capital, whether now outstanding or 
issued or acquired after the Closing Date, including common shares,
preferred  shares, membership interests in a limited liability company,
limited or general  partnership interests in a partnership, interests in a
trust, interests in  other  unincorporated organizations or any other
equivalent of such ownership interest  (collectively, " ** _Capital 
Securities_** "),  (ii)  Maker shall cease to, directly or indirectly, own
and control 100% of each  class  of the outstanding Capital Securities of
each of its subsidiaries; (iii) the  sale of substantially all of the assets
of Maker, (iv) the sale, in one  transaction or in a series of transactions,
of General Finance to an independent  third party or group of independent
third parties pursuant to which such party  or parties acquire equity
securities of General Finance representing more than  50% voting power of all
outstanding equity securities or (v) any Change of  Control (as defined under
the Credit Facility, as amended from time to time)  occurs.

6. _Maker\'s  Waivers; Assignment and Transfer_.  Maker  hereby waives presentment for payment, demand, protest, notice of protest and  notice of dishonor hereof, and all other notices of any kind to which it may  be  entitled under applicable law or otherwise. Holder may transfer all or any  portion of this Note to any Affiliate without the consent of Maker and, after  an  Event of Default occurs, Holder may transfer all or any portion of this Note  to  any Person that is not a competitor of the Maker or an Affiliate of a competitor  of the Maker.

11. _WAIVER  OF JURY TRIAL_.  MAKER  AND HOLDER HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR  OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING  UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS NOTE, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH ACTION,  SUIT OR OTHER PROCEEDING.

Registration Lapse Date or (ii) the Company  fails to maintain the Shelf
Registration continuously effective pursuant to  Section 1(a) hereof, Company
shall be requested in writing, which writing shall  specify the Registrable

disposition thereof (a " **Demand  Request** "),  by  Havner, Valenta or
Laminar (each a " **Demanding  Stockholder** "),  to  effect a registration
under the Securities Act of Registrable Securities held  by  such
Stockholders (each, a " **Required  Registration** "),  then  Company shall
promptly use all commercially reasonable efforts to effect such  Required
Registration by filing, at Company's option, either a Form S-1 or  Form S-3
registration statement (a " **Demand  Registration Statement** "); 
_provided_   the  Company shall not be required to comply with more than one
(1) Demand  Request during any twelve (12) month period. Each of Havner,
Valenta and  Laminar may only exercise one (1) Demand Request under this
Agreement;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that a  request or registration
shall not count as one of the Demand Requests (or  Required Registrations)
until it has become effective, and neither the last  nor  any subsequent
Demand Requests (or Required Registrations) shall count as one  of  the
Demand Requests (or Demand Registrations) unless the holders of Registrable 
Securities are able to register and sell at least 85% of the Registrable 
Securities requested to be included in such registration; _provided_ ,  that
in  any event the Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with  any  registration initiated as a Required Registration whether or not
it has become  effective and whether or not such registration has counted as
one of the  Required Registrations hereunder. Subject to the provisos in the

Request,  Company shall deliver a written notice (a " **Demand  Notice**
")  to  each Stockholder who did not make such Demand Request stating that
Company  intends to comply with a Demand Request and informing each such
Stockholder  of  its right to include Registrable Securities in such

Demand Notice, each  Stockholder shall have the right to request in writing
that Company include  all  or a specific portion of the Registrable
Securities held by such Stockholder  in  such Required Registration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth  herein, Company shall be
obligated to effect any one or more of such Required  Registrations pursuant
to a Shelf Registration Statement if the Demanding  Stockholder so requests
in connection with any Demand Request.

 

 

(c) _Selection  of Underwriters_.  In the  event that the Registrable
Securities to be registered pursuant to a Required  Registration are to be
disposed of in an underwritten public offering, the  underwriters of such
public offering shall be one or more underwriting firms  of  nationally
recognized standing selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable  to the
Demanding Stockholder. In the event Company elects to file a Demand 
Registration Statement on Form S-3 and the underwriters, if any, in such 
public offering or the Demanding Stockholder requests that Company provide 
disclosures otherwise required in connection with a Form S-1 registration 
statement, then Company shall include in such Demand Registration Statement 
such "long form" disclosures.

 

 

(d) Priority  on Required Registrations. In the event that, in the case of
any Required  Registration, the managing underwriter for the public offering
contemplated  by  Section 3.1(b) shall advise Company in writing (with a
copy to each holder  of  Registrable Securities requesting sale) that, in
such underwriter's opinion, the  amount of securities requested to be
included in such Required Registration  would adversely affect the public
offering and sale (including pricing) of  such  Registrable Securities (such
writing to state the basis of such opinion and  the  approximate number of
Registrable Securities that may be included in such public  offering without
such effect), Company will include in such Required  Registration the number
of Registrable Securities that the Company is so advised  can be sold in such
public offering, in the following amounts:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) __first__ _,_   all  Registrable Securities requested to be sold by
holders of Registrable Securities  pursuant to Section 3.1(b) _  pro  rata_
among  such holders on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities
owned by  each  such holders; and

 



 

(ii) __second__ _,_   securities proposed to be sold by Company for its own
account.

 



 

(e) __Black  Out Period__ _._ Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Board reasonably  determines that the
registration and distribution of Registrable Securities  (i) would reasonably
be expected to impede, delay or interfere with, or  require premature
disclosure of, any material financing, offering, acquisition,  merger,
corporate reorganization, or other significant transaction or any 
negotiations, discussions or pending proposals with respect thereto,
involving  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) would require
disclosure of  non-public material information, the disclosure of which would
reasonably be  expected to adversely affect Company, Company shall (x) be
entitled to  postpone the filing or effectiveness or suspend the
effectiveness of a  registration statement and/or the use of any prospectus
for a period of time  not  to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days and (y)
promptly give the  Stockholders written notice of such postponement or

rise to such  suspension); _  provided_   , that  Company shall not
utilize the right described in Section 3.1(b) more than  once in any twelve
(12) month period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  set forth

in calculating the 120-day period.

 

 

SECTION 3.2 __Incidental  Registration__ _._

 

 

(a) __Filing  of Registration Statement__ _._ If,  at any time after the
first anniversary of the date hereof, the Company proposes  to register, for
its own account or for the account of any other Person any  of  its
securities (an " **Incidental  Registration** ")  under  the Securities Act
(other than pursuant to a registration statement on  Form S-4 or Form S-8 or
any successor forms thereto) for sale to the  public, it will at each such
time give prompt written notice to all Stockholders  of its intention to do
so, which notice shall be given at least thirty  (30) days prior to the date
that a registration statement relating to such  registration is proposed to
be filed with the SEC. Upon the written request  of  any Stockholder to
include Registrable Securities held by it that are not  otherwise covered by
the Shelf Registration Statement or a Demand Registration  Statement in such
Incidental Registration (which request shall (i) be made  within fifteen (15)
days after the receipt of any such notice, and  (ii) specify the Registrable
Securities intended to be included by such  holder), Company will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the  registration of all 
Registrable Securities that Company has been so requested to register by
such  Stockholder; _  provided_   ,  _however_   , that  if, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to register any  securities and
prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed  in
connection with such registration, Company shall determine for any reason 
to  terminate such registration statement and not to register such
securities,  Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to  each  such holder and, thereupon, shall be relieved of its
obligation to register  any  Registrable Securities of such Persons in
connection with such  registration.

(b) __Selection  and Use of Underwriters__ _._ Underwriters,  if any, in
connection with any offering pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall  be selected
at the sole and exclusive discretion of Company. No Stockholder  shall
Transfer any Registrable Securities included in the Incidental  Registration
other than through the underwriter or underwriters so selected  by  Company.

 

 

(c) __Priority  on Incidental Registrations__ _._ If  the managing
underwriter for the offering contemplated by this Section 3.2  shall advise
Company in writing that, in such underwriter's opinion, the number  of
securities requested to be included in such Incidental Registration would 
adversely affect the offering and sale (including pricing) of such
securities,  Company shall include in such Incidental Registration the number
of securities  that Company is so advised can be sold in such offering, in
the following  amounts and order of priority:

 

 

(i) __first__ _,_   securities proposed to be sold by Company for its own
account;

 



 

(ii) __second__ _,_   securities proposed to be sold for persons who
triggered such Incidental  Registration under a demand right; and

rata among such  persons.

 

 

SECTION 3.3 __Registration  Procedures__ _._

 

 

Company  will use all commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Shelf
Registration  and Required Registration pursuant to Section 3.1 and each
Incidental  Registration pursuant to Section 3.2, and to cooperate with the
sale of  such Registrable Securities in accordance with such registration
statements  as  quickly as reasonably practicable, and Company will as
expeditiously as  reasonably practicable:

 

 

(a) subject  to the rights of Company set forth in Section 3.2(a), prepare
and file with  the SEC the registration statement and use all commercially
reasonable efforts  to cause the Registration to become effective;

Section 3.2(a), prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and  post-
effective amendments to any registration statement and any prospectus  used 
in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration
statement  effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect  to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by
such registration  statement until such time as all of such Registrable
Securities have been  disposed of in accordance with such registration
statement and cause the  prospectus to be supplemented by any required
prospectus supplement, and as  so  supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule
424 under the Securities  Act;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) furnish,  upon request, at no charge to the holders of the Registrable
Securities, to  each  holder of Registrable Securities to be included in
such Registration and the  underwriter or underwriters, without charge, at
least one copy of the signed  registration statement and any post-effective
amendment thereto, and such number  of conformed copies thereof and such
number of copies of the prospectus  (including each preliminary prospectus
and each prospectus filed under  Rule 424 under the Securities Act), any
amendments or supplements thereto  and any documents incorporated by
reference therein, as such holder or  underwriter may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the disposition of  the  Registrable Securities being
sold by such holder (it being understood that  Company consents to the use of
the prospectus and any amendment or supplement  thereto by each holder of
Registrable Securities covered by such registration  statement and the
underwriter or underwriters, in connection with the offering  and sale of the
Registrable Securities covered by the prospectus or any  amendment or
supplement thereto);

 



 

(d) promptly  notify each holder of the Registrable Securities to be included
in such  Registration and the underwriter or underwriters:

 

 

(i) of  any  stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of any
registration  statement, issued or threatened by the SEC in connection
therewith, and take  all  commercially reasonable actions required to
prevent the entry of such stop  order  or to remove it or obtain withdrawal
of it at the earliest possible moment  if  entered;

 

 

(ii) when  such  registration statement or any prospectus used in connection
therewith, or any  amendment or supplement thereto, has been filed and, with
respect to such  registration statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto, when the same  has become effective;

 

 

(iii) of  any  written request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
such registration  statement or prospectus or additional information;

occurrence of any  event that makes any statement made in a registration
statement or prospectus  untrue in any material respect or that requires the
making of any changes in  a  registration statement or prospectus so that,
in such regard, it shall not  contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit any material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements (in the case  of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made),  not  misleading;

 

 

(e) if  requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters, promptly
incorporate  in a  prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such
information relating  to  such underwriting as the managing underwriter or
underwriters reasonably request  to be included therein; and make all
required filings of such prospectus  supplement or post-effective amendment
as soon as practicable after being  notified of the matters incorporated in
such prospectus supplement or  post-effective amendment; _provided_   , 
_however_   , that  Company shall not be required to take any action
pursuant to this  Section 3.3(e) that would, in the opinion of counsel to the
Company,  violate applicable Law;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) on  or  prior to the date on which a Registration is declared effective,
use all  commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify, and

counsel, in connection with  the  registration or qualification of the
Registrable Securities covered by such  Registration for offer and sale under
the securities or "blue sky" laws of each  state and other jurisdiction of
the United States as any such holder or  underwriter reasonably requests in
writing; use all commercially reasonable  efforts to keep each such
registration or qualification effective, including  through new filings, or
amendments or renewals, during the period such  registration statement is
required to be kept effective; and do any and all  other acts or things
reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition  of the
Registrable Securities in all such jurisdictions reasonably requested  to 
be covered by such Registration.

 

 

(g) in  connection with any sale pursuant to a Registration, cooperate with
the holders  of Registrable Securities to be included in such Registration
and the managing  underwriter or underwriters, to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery  of certificates (not bearing any restrictive
legends including, without  limitation, those set forth in Section 2.1)
representing securities to be  sold under such Registration, and enable such
securities to be in such  denominations and registered in such names as the
managing underwriter or  underwriters, if any, or such holders may request;

 

 

(h) use  all  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be  registered with or approved by such other governmental

over Company or any Subsidiary  as may be necessary to enable the seller or
sellers thereof or the underwriter  or underwriters, as applicable, to
consummate the disposition of such  securities;

 

 

(i) use  all  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such legal opinions
and auditors' consents as may be required by applicable Law;

(12) month period;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(k) use  all  commercially reasonable efforts to cause its senior executive
officers to  participate in "road shows" at the request of the underwriters
in connection  with a Required Registration; _provided_   , that  such
senior executive officers shall not be required to participate in "road 
shows" for more than two (2) Required Registrations;

 



 

(l) register  the Registrable Securities on trading on AMEX, or such other
national securities  exchange or NASDAQ where the Common Stock is registered
for public  trading;

 



 

(m) provide  copies to Stockholders of "cold comfort" letters or other

the Stockholders  and  counsel for the Stockholders a copy of such
registration statement.

 



 

SECTION 3.4 __Registration  Expenses__ _._

 



 

Company  will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each
registration of  Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any
such registration  not  effected by the Company.

 

 

SECTION 3.5 __Indemnification;  Contribution__ _._

 

 

(a) Company  shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each holder  of Registrable Securities, its officers, directors,
partners, employees and  agents, if any, and each Person, if any, who
controls such holder within the  meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act,
against all losses, claims,  damages, liabilities (or proceedings in respect
thereof) and expenses (under  the  Securities Act or common law or
otherwise), joint or several, resulting from  any  violation by Company of
the provisions of the Securities Act or any untrue  statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any  registration statement
or prospectus (and as amended or supplemented if amended  or supplemented) or
any preliminary prospectus or caused by any omission or  alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary to
make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus,  in  light of
the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except  to 
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or proceedings in 
respect thereof) or expenses are caused by any untrue statement or alleged 
untrue statement contained in, or by any omission or alleged omission from, 
information concerning any holder of Registrable Securities furnished in
writing  to Company by such holder expressly for use therein. No action or
failure to  act  on the part of the underwriters (whether or not such
underwriter is an Affiliate  of any holder of Registrable Securities) shall
affect the obligations of Company  to indemnify any holder of Registrable
Securities or any other Person pursuant  to the preceding sentence. In
connection with any underwritten offering pursuant  to Section 3.2, Company
agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement in  customary form with the
applicable underwriters, and Company agrees to indemnify  such underwriters,
their officers, directors, employees and agents, if any,  and  each Person,
if any, who controls such underwriters within the meaning of  Section 15 of
the Securities Act to the same extent as herein before  provided with respect
to the indemnification of the holders of Registrable  Securities; _ 
provided_   that  Company shall not be required to indemnify any such
underwriter, or any officer,  director or employee of such underwriter or any
Person who controls such  underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act, to the  extent that the loss, claim, damage, liability (or
proceedings in respect  thereof) or expense for which indemnification is
claimed results from such  underwriter's failure to send or give a copy of an
amended or supplemented final  prospectus to the Person asserting an untrue
statement or alleged untrue  statement or omission or alleged omission at or
prior to the written  confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities to
such Person if such  statement or omission was corrected in such amended or
supplemented final  prospectus prior to such written confirmation and the
underwriter was provided  with such amended or supplemented final prospectus.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  connection with any registration statement in connection with an
offering in  which a holder of Registrable Securities is participating, each
such holder,  severally and not jointly, shall indemnify, to the fullest
extent permitted  by  applicable Law, Company, each underwriter and their
respective officers,  directors, employees and agents, if any, and each
Person, if any, who controls  Company or such underwriter within the meaning
of Section 15 of the  Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities (or proceedings  in respect thereof) and expenses resulting from
any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact in, or
any omission or alleged omission  of a  material fact required to be stated
in, the registration statement or prospectus  or preliminary prospectus or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or  necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, in  light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, but  only  to the
extent that such untrue statement is contained in, or such omission  is 
from, information so concerning a holder furnished in writing by such holder 
expressly for use therein; _  provided_   that  such holder's obligations
hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the  net proceeds to such
holder of the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to  such  registration
statement.

 

 

(c) Any  Person entitled to indemnification under the provisions of this
Section 3.5  shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any
claim with  respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such
indemnifying  party to assume the defense of such claim, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory  to the indemnified party; and if such defense is so
assumed, such indemnifying  party shall not enter into any settlement without
the consent of the indemnified  party if such settlement attributes liability
to the indemnified party and  such  indemnifying party shall not be subject
to any liability for any settlement  made  without its consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld); and any  underwriting agreement entered into
with respect to any registration statement  provided for under this Article
III shall so provide. In the event an  indemnifying party shall elect not to
assume the defense of a claim, such  indemnifying party shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more  than one counsel or firm of
counsel for all parties indemnified by such  indemnifying party in respect of
such claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) If  for  any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable, then the
indemnifying party  shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as  a  result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or expenses (i) in such  proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the  indemnifying party on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other or  (ii) if the allocation provided by clause
(i) above is not permitted  by applicable Law or provides a lesser sum to the
indemnified party than the  amount hereinafter calculated, in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect  not only the relative benefits received by the
indemnifying party on the one  hand and the indemnified party on the other
but also the relative fault of  the  indemnifying party and the indemnified
party as well as any other relevant  equitable considerations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no holder of  Registrable Securities shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess  of  the amount such holder
would have been required to pay to an indemnified party  if the indemnity
under Section 3.5(b) were available. No Person guilty of  fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the  Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not  guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligation of any Person to 
contribute pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be several and not  joint.

 

 

(e) An  indemnifying party shall make payments of all amounts required to be
made  pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.5 to or for
the  account of the indemnified party from time to time promptly upon receipt
of  bills or invoices relating thereto or when otherwise due or  payable.

 

 

(f) The  indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 3.5
shall  remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
by or  on  behalf of a participating holder of Registrable Securities, its
officers,  directors, agents or any Person, if any, who controls such holder
as aforesaid,  and shall survive the Transfer of Equity Securities by such
holder and the  termination of this Agreement for any reason.

 

 

SECTION 3.6 __Holdback  Agreements__ _._

 

 

Each  Stockholder agrees not to sell, make any short sale of, grant any
option for  the  purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any Equity Securities,
other than those  Registrable Securities included in such Registration
pursuant to  Section 3.1 or 3.2(a), for the seven (7) days prior to and the
ninety  (90) days after the effectiveness of the registration statement
pursuant to  which such offering shall be made (or such longer periods as may
be advised  by  the underwriter with respect to the applicable offering but
in any event not  to  exceed thirty (30) days prior to and ninety (90) days
after the  effectiveness of such registration statement). Company agrees that
it and its  executive officers will be subject to the holdback period
requested by the  underwriters of a Required Registration, if any, pursuant
to this  Section 3.6 to the extent that such underwriters determine such
holdback by  Company and its executive officers is reasonably necessary for
the successful  offering and sale of all Registrable Securities in connection
with such  registration.

 

 

SECTION 3.7 __Availability  of Information__ _._

 

 

The  Company shall cooperate with each Stockholder who is a holder of any
Registrable  Securities in supplying such information as may be reasonably
necessary for  such  holder to complete and file any information reporting
forms presently or  hereafter required by the SEC as a condition to the
availability of an exemption  from the Securities Act for the sale of any
Registrable Securities.

SECTION 3.8 __Information  Concerning Stockholders__ _._

 

 

It  shall  be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to
include the  Registrable Securities of any selling Stockholder in any
registration statement  or prospectus, as the case may be, that such selling
Stockholder shall take  the  actions described in this Section 3.8:

 

 

(a) each  selling Stockholder that has requested inclusion of its Registrable
Securities  in any registration statement shall furnish to the Company in
writing all  information as may be necessary to make the information
previously furnished  to  the Company by such Stockholder, in light of the
circumstances under which  it  was made, not misleading, any other
information regarding such Stockholder  and  the distribution of such
Registrable Securities as may be required to be  disclosed in the prospectus
or registration statement under applicable Law  or  pursuant to SEC comments
and any information otherwise reasonably requested  from  time to time by
the Company to comply with applicable Law or regulations,  including, without
limitation, (i) the then current name and address of  such Stockholder(s),
(ii) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities  requested to be
registered, (iii) the total number of Registrable  Securities then held by
such Stockholder(s), (iv) the intended means of  distribution, and (v) any
other information required to be disclosed with  respect to such Stockholder
or such Stockholder's Registrable Securities in the  registration statement
or related prospectus by the Securities Act;

 

 

(b) each  selling Stockholder shall promptly (i) following it becoming aware
thereof,  notify the Company of the occurrence of any event that makes any
statement  made  in a registration statement or prospectus regarding such
selling Stockholder  untrue in any material respect or that requires the
making of any changes in  a  registration statement or prospectus so that,
in such regard, it shall not  contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit any material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements (in the case  of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made),  not  misleading and (ii) in connection with
providing such notice, provide the  Company with such information in its
possession as may be required to enable  the  Company to prepare a
supplement or post-effective amendment to any such  registration statement or
a supplement to such prospectus;

 

 

(c) with  respect to any registration statement for an underwritten offering,
the  inclusion of a Stockholder's Registrable Securities therein shall be 
conditioned, at the managing underwriter's request, upon the execution and 
delivery by such Stockholder of an underwriting agreement as may be
negotiated  by the Company;

 

 

(d) any  sale of any Registrable Securities by any Stockholder shall
constitute a  representation and warranty by such Stockholder that the
prospectus delivered  by  such Stockholder does not as of the time of such
sale contain any untrue  statement of a material fact relating to the
information expressly provided  in  writing by such Stockholder for
inclusion in such prospectus and that such  prospectus does not as of the
time of such sale omit to state any material  fact  relating to the
information expressly provided in writing by such Stockholder  for inclusion
in such prospectus necessary to make the statements in such  prospectus, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading; and

 

 

(e) no  Stockholder shall use, distribute or otherwise disseminate any "free
writing  prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, in
connection  with the sale of Registrable Shares under the Shelf Registration
Statement,  without the prior written consent of the Company.

**FIRST  AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT**

 

 

THIS  FIRST AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this " **Amendment** ")  is 
entered into as of July 22, 2008 by and between Pac-Van, Inc., an Indiana 
corporation (" **Pac-Van** "),  and  Theodore M. Mourouzis (" **Employee**
" and  collectively with Pac-Van, the " **Parties** ").

 



 

**RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS,  the Parties entered into that certain Employment Agreement dated as
of August  1,  2006 (the " **Original  Agreement** ");  and

 



 

WHEREAS,  in connection with the potential acquisition of Pac-Van by General
Finance  Corporation ("GFN"), the Parties desire to amend the Original
Agreement as  set  forth herein, and desire that, except as set forth in
this Amendment, the  Original Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

 



 

NOW  THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations,  warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions
hereinafter set forth, and  other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which  are  hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Definitions_.  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have  the  meanings ascribed to them in the Original Agreement (without regard to this  Amendment).

 



 

2. _Amendment_.  Reference hereby is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date  herewith, among Pac-Van, Mobile Office Acquisition Corp., GFN and the other  parties named therein (the "Merger Agreement"). If, and only if, the Merger  (as  defined in the Merger Agreement) occurs, then on the Effective Time (as defined  in the Merger Agreement), Section 2 of the Original Agreement is  hereby  amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

 



 

"2.  _Term  of Employment_.  Employee's employment under this Agreement
shall commence on August 1, 2006 and  shall end on July 31, 2010 ("
**Initial  Term** ")  or  such earlier date on which Employee's employment
is terminated under Section 6  of this Agreement (the " **Expiration  Date**
")."

 



 

Nothing  contained herein shall obligate the parties to the Merger Agreement
to complete  the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to
completion of  the  Merger, this Amendment shall be void and of no force and
effect without any  further action on the part of the parties hereto.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. _References_.  All  references in the Original Agreement to "Agreement," "herein," "hereof," or  terms of like import referring to the Original Agreement or any portion thereof  are hereby amended to refer to the Original Agreement as amended by this  Amendment.

 



 

4. _No  Implied Amendments_.  Except  as expressly provided herein, the Original Agreement is not being amended,  supplemented, or otherwise modified, and the Original Agreement shall continue  in force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

5. _Counterparts_.  This  Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall  be  deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but  one  and the same agreement.

 



 

6. _Successors  and Assigns_.  This  Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto  and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

7. _Governing  Law_.  This  Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal  laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of Indiana.

 



 

IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has executed this
Amendment,  or  caused this Amendment to be executed on its behalf by a
representative duly  authorized, as of the date first above written.

to the  fullest extent that it may lawfully waive such rights and benefits.
In  connection with the waiver and relinquishment set forth in this Section

discover facts  in  addition to and/or different from those now known or
believed to be true,  but  that notwithstanding that fact, it is the MOAC
Party\'s intention hereby to  fully, finally, and forever release all of the
Claims released herein, known  or  unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which
now exist, may in the future exist  or  heretofore have existed between the
MOAC Party, on the one hand, and those  parties, persons and entities granted
