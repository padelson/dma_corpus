best interest of, their respective companies and respective equityholders for
Parent to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Companys
common stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Shares_ "), through the Merger,
upon which the Company shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (ii)
authorized and approved this Agreement, the Merger and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and delivered to each other written copies

State of Delaware, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and, substantially concurrently
with the execution and delivery hereof, the stockholders of the Company
holding 90% of the issued and outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon have
adopted this Agreement by written consent, which consent has been certified
and delivered to Parent (the " _Stockholder Approval_ ").

In connection with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement for

(a) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
the Stockholders Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail Parents good faith calculation of the
following items (each a " _Closing Item_ "): (i) Cash as of the Adjustment
Time (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, " _Final Cash_
"); (ii) Working Capital as of the Adjustment Time (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, the " _Final Working Capital_ "); (iii)
the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of Closing (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.6_, " _Final Indebtedness_ "); (iv) the aggregate amount of
Transaction Expenses (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_,
the " _Final Transaction Expenses_ "); and (v) the resulting calculation of
the Final Purchase Price. With respect to any Closing Item (and each line
item thereof), the exchange rate of any currency other than U.S. Dollars
shall be determined based on the published Wall Street Journal rate on the
date the Estimated Closing Statement is delivered by the Company to Parent.

 

(b) From and after the Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing
Statement until the Closing Items are finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_, the Stockholders Representative, its Affiliates and their
auditors, accountants and other Representatives shall be permitted reasonable
access to the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and their auditors,
accountants, personnel, books and records and any other documents or
information reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative
(including the information, data and work papers used by auditors or
accountants that assisted in the preparation of the Closing Items).

(c) The Stockholders Representative shall have 30 calendar days after
its receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") within which
to review Parents calculation of the Closing Items. If the Stockholders
Representative disputes any of the Closing Items, the
Stockholders Representative shall notify Parent in writing of its objection
to such Closing Item(s) within the Review Period, together with a description
of the basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the extent
reasonably possible) (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Closing Items, as set
forth in the Closing Statement, shall become final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties unless the Stockholders Representative delivers to Parent a
Dispute Notice within the Review Period. If the Stockholders Representative
timely delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the Closing Statement not
objected to by the Stockholders Representative in the Dispute Notice (or by
Parent as a result of the items disputed by the Stockholders Representative
in any such Dispute Notice) shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties, and Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall, within 30
calendar days following Parents receipt of such Dispute Notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to
resolve in writing their differences with respect to the matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice (and any matters with respect to the Closing Items which
Parent is disputing as a result of the matters set forth in the Dispute
Notice, or any disputed matters arising out of the foregoing) and any such
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If, at
the conclusion of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute, then
each of Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall submit all items
remaining in dispute to a nationally or regionally recognized accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders Representative (the "
_Valuation Firm_ ") for resolution by delivering within 15 calendar days after
the expiration of the Resolution Period to the Valuation Firm their written
position with respect to such items remaining in dispute. The fees and
expenses of the Valuation Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be
divided equally between Parent and the Stockholders Representative (it being
understood that the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to pay all
such fees out of the Expense Holdback Amount). The Valuation Firm shall
determine, based solely on the submissions by the Stockholders Representative
and Parent, and not by independent review, only those issues set forth in the

 



17  Dispute Notice that remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any
such disputed item which is equal to or between the final values proposed by
Parent and the Stockholders Representative in their respective submissions.
The Parties shall request that the Valuation Firm make a decision with respect
to all disputed items within 30 calendar days after the submissions of the
Parties, and in any event as promptly as practicable. The final determination
with respect to all dispute items shall be set forth in a written statement by
the Valuation Firm delivered to Parent and the Stockholders Representative
and shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent, the Stockholders
Representative and the Equityholders. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall promptly execute any reasonable engagement letter
requested by the Valuation Firm and shall each cooperate fully with
the Valuation Firm, including by providing the information, data and work
papers used by each Party to prepare and/or calculate the Closing Items,
making its personnel and accountants available to explain any such
information, data or work papers, so as to enable the Valuation Firm to make
such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable.

(d) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price
(such excess amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then, within three (3) Business
Days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_, (i) Parent shall pay (without interest) to the Paying Agent
an aggregate amount equal to the Excess Amount and instruct the Paying Agent
to pay (without interest) to the Equityholders, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Equityholders account set forth in the
Funds Flow, the aggregate portion of the Excess Amount that such Equityholder
is entitled in accordance with _Section 2.6(g)_ and (ii) the Stockholders
Representative and Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Amount.

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price (such
shortfall amount, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), the Stockholders
Representative and Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days following the
determination of the Closing Items pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Parent from the Escrow Amount, the Shortfall Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Parent. If the Shortfall Amount is less than the Escrow Amount then the
Stockholders Representative and Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days
following the determination of the Closing Items pursuant to this _Section
2.6_, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to deliver to the Paying Agent (for further payment to the
Equityholders pursuant to _Section 2.6(g)_) an aggregate amount equal to the
Escrow Amount _plus_ any interest accrued thereon _minus_ the Shortfall
Amount.

(f) Unless the Stockholders Representative determines otherwise, on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Stockholders Representative shall
pay to the Paying Agent (for further payment to the Equityholders pursuant
to  _Section 2.6(g)_) an aggregate amount equal to the remaining Expense
Holdback Amount.

(g) All amounts payable to the Equityholders pursuant to this _Section 2.6_
shall be paid as if such amounts had been included in the Closing Merger
Consideration; _provided_ that any amounts payable to the Option Holders shall
be paid net of the applicable withholding amount pursuant to _Section 2.5_,
in each case, as determined by the Stockholders Representative.

(h) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be deemed an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

Section 2.7 _No Further Rights of Transfers_. At and after the Effective
Time, (a) each Stockholder shall cease to have any rights as an equityholder
of the Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law and except for
the right of each Stockholder to deliver a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal in exchange for payment of the portion of the Merger

 



18  Consideration such Stockholder is entitled to pursuant to this Agreement in
the manner and at the times set forth herein and (b) no transfer of Shares
shall be made on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. Immediately
after the Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed.

Section 2.8  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Shares that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by Stockholders who shall not have
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall
have properly demanded and are entitled to appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. Such Stockholders
instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, solely to
the extent such Stockholders have perfected and not withdrawn and are
otherwise entitled to appraisal in accordance with the DGCL. If any such
Stockholder is not entitled to appraisal of such Stockholders Shares in
accordance with the DGCL or otherwise withdraws such Stockholders demand
for appraisal, such Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, without any
interest thereon, the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in the
manner provided in this _Article II_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Stockholder is not entitled
to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the rights of such
holder under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into and
represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided
herein upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, executed and delivered by
such Stockholder, together with any certificates formerly representing the
dissenting Shares held by such Stockholder (and, in the case of any lost or
damaged certificates formerly representing the dissenting Shares held by such
Stockholder, an affidavit of lost or damaged certificate in respect thereof).
Prior to Closing, the Company shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice
of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

Section 2.9 Post-Closing Payments. The Paying Agent Agreement shall provide
that all Equityholders that have delivered a duly-executed Letter of
Transmittal or Option Cancelation Acknowledgement Agreement, as applicable,
prior to the Closing Date shall be paid at the Closing and any Equityholder
that delivers a duly-executed Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancelation
Acknowledgement Agreement, as applicable, on or after the Closing Date shall
be paid (without interest) as promptly as practicable upon delivery of such
duly-executed Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancelation Acknowledgement
Agreement, as applicable.

terminate, or accelerate any obligation or the loss of any material benefit
under any provision of any Material Contract, (iii) result in the creation or
imposition of any material Lien upon any of the material property or material
assets of either the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or (iv) subject to

Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Delaware and each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite power
and 

 



37  authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its

jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing

any delay in the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
have a material adverse effect on Parent or Merger Sub or (c) result in any
liability to the Company or any Equityholder in connection therewith. All of
the issued and outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub are owned directly

Section 4.2 _Authorization; Noncontravention_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and
authority, and has taken all corporate action necessary or required, to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the consummation
by each of them of the transactions contemplated hereby and the performance
by each of them of their respective obligations hereunder have been duly
authorized and approved. No other corporate action on the part of either of
Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming
that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and by general
equitable principles. 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, (i) conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as amended to the date hereof, (ii)
subject to the filings required under the Antitrust Laws, conflict with,
result in a breach of or default under (including a breach due to the failure
to notify or obtain the prior consent or waiver of any Person), or give rise
to a right to modify or terminate, or accelerate any obligation under any
material contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or (iii) subject to
the filings required under the Antitrust Laws, contravene any Law or any Order
currently in effect, which, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_
above, would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on Parent or Merger Sub or their ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals_.

 

Assuming any filings required under the Antitrust Laws are made and any
waiting periods thereunder have been terminated or expired, no consent,
approval, license, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, notice to or waiver from any Governmental Entity, which has not
been received or made, is required with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for the filing of the Certificate of
Merger or any other consents, approvals, licenses, orders or authorizations
of, or registrations or declarations or filings which, if not made or
obtained, would be reasonably likely to (a) prevent, or result in any delay of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) have a material
adverse effect on Parent or Merger Sub or (c) result in any liability to the
Company or any Equityholder in connection therewith. All of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub are owned directly by Parent free

38 Section 4.4 _Broker s or Finders Fee_. No agent, broker or other
Person acting for or on behalf or at the behest of Parent or Merger Sub or
any Affiliate thereof is, or will be, entitled to any fee or commission
(including any brokers or finders fees) in connection with this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby from any of the other Parties or
from the Company or any Affiliate of the other Parties.

 

Section 4.5 _Merger Sub s Operations_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents and has not engaged in any business activities or
conducted any operations, and has not incurred liabilities or obligations of
any nature, other than in connection with such transactions. 

Section 4.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
(a) executed debt commitment letters (including the exhibits, annexes and
schedules thereto, the " _Debt Financing Commitment Letters_ ", as the same
may be amended, supplemented, modified, restated or replaced), pursuant to
which the lender parties thereto (the " _Financing Sources_ ," as such term
is further defined in _Section 1.1_) have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the financing in the
aggregate amount set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (the "
_Debt Financing_ "), and (b) an executed fee letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ")
related to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, which copy of the Fee Letter
may be redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms
that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Parent has
delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of an equity
commitment letter (the " _Equity Financing Commitment Letter_ ," and together
with the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ ")
pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source has committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to invest the amount set forth therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ ", and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
"). As of the date hereof, the Equity Financing Commitment is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and the
Equity Financing Source party thereto, enforceable against them in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of the Parent, the
Financing Sources parties thereto, enforceable against them in accordance
with their terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
the Enforceability Exceptions. Assuming the conditions to the Financing
Commitments with respect to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter and with respect to the Equity Financing, as set
forth in section 2 of the Equity Commitment Letter are satisfied and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the aggregate cash proceeds
contemplated by the Financing Commitments to be funded on the Closing Date for
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
netting out original issue discount, upfront fees and other similar premiums
and charges after giving effect to the maximum amount of "market flex"
provided under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter),
together with cash on hand of Parent, will be sufficient for the Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including payment
of the Merger Consideration and all other amounts payable by it in connection
with this Agreement including its fees and expenses (including the increase in
Enterprise Value after August 31). No payment event of default or bankruptcy
event has occurred and is continuing under the Existing Credit Agreement (as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letter), the effect of which would be to reduce
(or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate cash proceeds of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be funded on the
Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any commitment fees or other amounts due
and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Financing Commitments, and will pay in full any such fees and amounts due on
or before the Closing Date.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 8.10_, Parents
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder are not
subject to any condition regarding Parents or any of its Affiliates ability
to obtain financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



39 Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Parent and Merger Sub are not entering the
transactions contemplated hereby with actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.10(b)_ and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company in _Article III_ in all
material respects, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Financing and the payment of the Merger Consideration,
each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. There is no Action before any Governmental Entity
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against or affecting
Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective properties or rights with
respect to, or that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal or otherwise interfering with, the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.9 _Investment Intent_.

 

(a) Parent is acquiring the Shares for its own account, for investment
purposes only and not with a view toward, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling
such Shares, in each case, in violation of the federal securities Laws or any
applicable foreign or state securities Law.

 

(b) Parent qualifies as an "accredited investor", as such term is defined in
Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. 

(c) Parent understands that the acquisition of the Shares to be acquired by it
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement involves substantial risk. Parent and
its Representatives have experience as investors in equity interests and other
securities of companies such as the ones being transferred pursuant to this
Agreement, and Parent can bear the economic risk of its investment (which may
be for an indefinite period) and has such knowledge and experience in
financial or business matters that Parent is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in such Shares to be acquired by it pursuant to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Parent understands that the Shares to be acquired by it pursuant to this
Agreement have not been registered under the Securities Act. Parent
acknowledges that such securities may not be transferred, sold, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act and any other provision of applicable state
securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom. Parent
acknowledges that there is no public market for the Shares and that there can
be no assurance that a public market will develop.

 

Section 4.10 _Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates is contemplating any plant closing, reduction in
force or terminations of employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that would give rise to notice or payment in lieu of notice obligations under
the WARN Act or any foreign Law.

merger, reorganization, recapitalization, sale of assets or otherwise, with
any Person other than Parent, its Affiliates and their Representatives.

 

(d) _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (x) the
date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Article VII_ and (y) the
Closing, the Company shall grant to the Parent and its authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to senior management, the properties and the books
and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ that (i)
such access does not unreasonably interfere with normal operations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) all requests for access shall be
directed to Jared Sokolsky or such other Person(s) designated by the Company
in writing, and (iii) nothing herein shall require the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to provide access to, or to disclose any 

 



41  information to, Parent or any other Person if such access or disclosure (A)
would be in violation of applicable Laws or regulations of any Governmental
Entity (including the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws), or (B) would be a
breach of any provision of any contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party.

 

(e) _Communications_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Kevin Barrett, the
chief executive officer of the Company (or his successor in the event of
death or disability), will coordinate and mutually agree upon a communications
plan in respect of the employees, customers and other material business
relations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and in accordance
therewith Parent and its Representatives will be provided with reasonable
access to such Persons; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing
herein is intended to prohibit Parent and its Representatives from
communicating with, or engaging in business with, any customers or suppliers
that are also customers or suppliers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
so long as such communication is in the ordinary course and unrelated to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) _Consents_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, at
the sole cost of Parent (provided such costs shall be limited to costs of
unrelated third parties and shall not include any internal costs of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), to obtain the consents set forth on
_Schedule 5.1(f)_ ; _provided_ however that it is expressly acknowledged
by the Parties that obtaining any such consents shall not be a condition to
the Closing. To the extent requested by the Company, Parent shall cooperate
with the Company to obtain such consents.

 

(g) _Capital Expenditures_. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date (the
" _Interim Period_ "), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall make
capital expenditures (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in the
aggregate, in accordance with the 2015 capital expenditure forecast (but
solely as it relates to the Interim Period) attached hereto as _Annex E_ (the
" _2015 CapEx Forecast_ "). For purposes of determining the Companys and the
Company Subsidiaries compliance with the foregoing covenant and the CapEx
Shortfall Amount, capital expenditures actually funded versus capital
expenditures forecasted during the period between the date hereof and Closing
shall be determined on a pro-rated monthly basis and aggregated. In the event
that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries fail to make such capital
expenditures, in the aggregate, in accordance with the CapEx Forecast between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, then promptly following the Closing Date
(or after otherwise becoming aware of such failure, anticipated to be within
approximately 30 days following the completion of the close of the financial
books and records for the month end following the Closing), Parent shall
provide notice (the " _CapEx Shortfall Notice_ ") to the Stockholders
Representative of such failure, together with Parents calculation of the
amount not funded by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance
the 2015 CapEx Forecast (the " _CapEx Shortfall Amount_ "). From and after
receipt of the CapEx Shortfall Notice, the access, review and dispute
resolution provisions set forth in _Section 2.6(b)_ and _Section 2.6(c)_
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to this _Section 5.1(g)_. Upon final
determination of the CapEx Shortfall Amount, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent from the Escrow Amount
the CapEx Shortfall Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated by Parent.

Section 5.2 _401(k) Plan_. The Company and any Company Subsidiary, as
appropriate, shall adopt board resolutions to terminate any 401(k) plan
maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (the " _401(k) Plan_ ")
effective as of the close of business of the day prior to the Closing Date
(but contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing) and in connection
therewith fully vest all accounts of all participants in the 401(k) Plan. The
Company shall deliver to Parent at Closing duly executed resolutions of the
board of directors of the Company and any Company Subsidiary, as appropriate,
reflecting such termination of the 401(k) Plan. Parent shall permit each
participant in the 401(k) Plan who is an employee of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing to

 



42  participate as soon as reasonably practicable in and make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, and for the avoidance of doubt including
rollovers of loan promissory notes) in cash (but including rollovers of loan
promissory notes) to a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code maintained by Parent (the " _Parent 401(k)
Plan_ "); provided, however, that Parent reserves the right to suspend the
distribution of benefits from the 401(k) Plan until the later of (i) the
completion of final testing and record keeping for the 401(k) Plan and (ii)
the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to
the termination of the 401(k) Plan (if Parent, in its sole discretion, decides
to file for such a determination letter), except that if Parent reserves
such right Parent shall take all actions necessary to permit continued
ongoing repayment of any loans outstanding under the 401(k) Plan. Effective as
of the Closing, Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to credit for
purposes of participation and vesting all service credited for such purposes
with respect to employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under the
401(k) Plan as of the Closing.

 

Section 5.3 _Confidentiality_. Subject to _Section 5.7_, each of the Company
(on behalf of itself, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives) and Parent (on behalf of itself, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives) acknowledges that it remains bound by the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement by and between the Company
and Parent, dated March 25, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") until
the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate and be
of no further force and effect. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VII_ and continue in full force and effect thereafter and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be modified, waived or amended without the
written consent of the Company or Parent, respectively; provided, however,
nothing therein shall be deemed to limit disclosures in connection with legal
proceedings between the Parties, including to the extent necessary to enforce
the Parties rights hereunder.

 

Section 5.4 _Antitrust Laws_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall: (i) as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than six (6) Business Days from the date hereof, take all
actions necessary to file or cause to be filed any filings required of it or
any of its Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Notification and Report Forms required pursuant to the HSR Act with

made to or received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any
Antitrust Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
subject to applicable Law, permit the other Parties to review in advance any
proposed substantive written communication to any such Antitrust Authority
and incorporate the other Parties reasonable comments thereto, (C) not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such
Antitrust Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or
inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Antitrust Authority,
gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend, and furnish the other
Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one
hand and any such Antitrust Authority or its respective staff on the other
hand, in each case with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Actions under (A), (B) and (C) of this Section may be
limited to an outside counsel only basis to the extent reasonably deemed
necessary by the Parties.

 



43 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Antitrust Law so as to
(i) enable the Parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible and (ii) avoid any Action by any
Governmental Entity, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
delaying the Closing beyond the End Date. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Parents efforts shall include (A) defending through litigation on the merits,
including appeals, any Action asserted in any court or other proceeding by
any Person; (B) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent, its Subsidiaries or the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including entering into customary
ancillary agreements on commercially reasonable terms relating to any such
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses; (C)
agreeing to any limitation on the conduct of Parent, its Subsidiaries and the
Company and Company Subsidiaries; or (D) agreeing to take any other action as
may be required by a Governmental Authority in order to (1) obtain all
necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as soon as reasonably
possible, and in any event before the End Date, (2) avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, dissolved, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect as part of any Action and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (3) effect
the expiration or termination of any waiting period, which would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Affiliates of Parent,
other than Parents Subsidiaries, shall have no obligation (and Parent shall
have no obligation to cause Affiliates of Parent other than Parents
Subsidiaries) to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)_, including
but not limited to, selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of, or
limiting its freedom of action with respect to the assets or business of
Parents Affiliates, in each case, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Compensation_. During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are
employed at the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ ") to be provided with
compensation that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing (including with
respect to opportunities for bonus and commission, but not equity-based
compensation). Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Company Employees to be granted credit for all service
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including any predecessors of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) earned prior to the Closing Date for
all purposes (except benefit accrual, _provided_ that service shall be
credited for purposes of determining the level or amount of any severance or
paid time off benefits) under any compensation plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement that is sponsored by or may be established or
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates on or after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "). Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, is intended to require Parent to
continue any specific Employee Benefit Plan or to confer upon any employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary any right to continued employment for
any period, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of
any New Plan. 

Section 5.6 _Indemnity; Directors  and Officers Insurance; Fiduciary and
Employee Benefit Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent acknowledges that (i) each Person that at any time prior to the

the Company or any Company Subsidiary, served as a director, officer, manager,
member, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such persons heirs, executors
or administrators, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") is entitled to
indemnification,

or any Company Subsidiarys, as the case may be, obligations, with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain and maintain in
effect for a period of six years thereafter, (i) a tail policy to the current
policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, with respect to claims arising from

shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage
currently provided by such current policy and (ii) "run off" coverage
as provided by the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries fiduciary and
employee benefits policies, in each case, covering those Persons who are
covered on the date hereof by such policies and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the
coverage provided under the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing
policies (collectively, the " _Tail Policy_ "). No claims made under or in
respect of such Tail Policy shall be settled without the prior written
consent of the applicable Indemnified Person.

Section 5.7 _Press Release_. The Parties agree that (i) there will be an
initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement to be
mutually agreed upon and issued at a date to be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Stockholders Representative following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, which shall be a release by Parent and (ii) there will be
press releases with respect to the closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be mutually agreed upon and issued promptly following the Closing
by both Parent and the Stockholders Representative. (a) Nothing herein shall
restrict or prohibit the Company from making any announcements to its

and Friedman Capital Partners VI L.P. (including their performance
and improvements) in connection with fund raising, marketing, informational
or reporting activities, (c) nothing contained herein limits any Party from
making any announcements, statements or acknowledgments that such Party is

exchange to make, issue or release, or limit Parent from making any
disclosures that it deems necessary or advisable to be made in filings with
the SEC.

 

Section 5.8 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party shall
be liable for and pay all of its own costs and expenses (including
attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and other out-of-pocket

the performance of such Partys obligations hereunder and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, Parent shall pay and be
fully responsible for all filing fees under the Antitrust Laws, in addition to
any reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company or the Company

Section 5.10 _Tax Matters_. Parent will not take any action with respect to
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the
same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax

None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall make
any election under Sections 336(e) or 338 of the Code with respect to the

to be paid pursuant to this Agreement that is treated as compensation for
income tax purposes may be paid to the Company or Company Subsidiary (at such
time upon which such payment is due), which in turn, shall pay the applicable
recipient such amounts through the Companys or Company Subsidiaries payroll
less applicable withholding Taxes, and will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in respect of which such
withholding was made.

Section 5.11 _Investigation by Parent; No Other Representations; Non-Reliance
of Parent_. Parent and its Affiliates have substantial familiarity with the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to their Knowledge
fully understand the risks inherent therewith. Furthermore, Parent (for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) has conducted an
independent investigation, verification, review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
technology and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
Parent, its Affiliates and their advisors and Representatives have had access
to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement,
Parent has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and
analysis and not on any factual representations or opinions of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any Equityholder or any of their respective
Representatives or any other Person, except for the specific representations
and warranties expressly made by the Company in _Article III_ , the Company
Closing Certificate and in any other certificate delivered hereunder by the
Company or any officer thereof, in each case, as qualified by the Schedules
(the " _Express Representations_ "). Parent (for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates and Representatives and each of their successors and assigns): (a)
except for the Express Representations, specifically acknowledges that none
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Equityholder or any other Person

implied, at law or in equity, in respect of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, assets, liabilities,
operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) including with
respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any
assets, the nature or extent of any liabilities, the prospects of the
business, the

 



46  effectiveness or the success of any operations, or the accuracy or
completeness of any confidential information memoranda, management
presentations, projections, documents, material or other information
(financial or otherwise) regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries

available to Parent, its Affiliates or their Representatives in any data
rooms, management presentations or in any other manner or form in expectation
of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) except
for the Express Representations, specifically and irrevocably disclaims that
it is relying upon or has relied upon any such other representations or
warranties that may have been made by any Person and acknowledges that the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Equityholders and their respective
Affiliates hereby specifically disclaim any such other representation or
warranty made by any Person; (c) subject to _Section 5.12_, specifically
disclaims any obligation or duty by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the
Equityholders and their respective Affiliates or any other Person to make any
disclosures of fact not required to be disclosed by the Express

this Agreement and acquiring the Company and the Company Subsidiaries subject
only to the Express Representations (all of which such Express
Representations shall expire and terminate at the Effective Time as set forth
in _Article VI_ ) and the terms and conditions set forth herein. Without
limiting the generality any of the foregoing, (i) except for the Express
Representations, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the
Equityholders or any of their Affiliates makes any representation or warranty
regarding any third party beneficiary rights or other rights which Parent or
its Affiliates might claim under any studies, reports, tests or analyses
prepared by any third parties for the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their Affiliates, even if the same were made available for review by Parent
or its Affiliates or Representatives; and (ii) none of the documents,
information or other materials provided to Parent at any time or in any format
by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Equityholders or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives constitutes legal advice, and Parent waives all
rights to assert that it received any legal advice from the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Equityholders or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives or any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective
Representatives or counsel, or that it had any sort of attorney-client
relationship with any of such Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this _Section 5.11_ or otherwise shall limit any claim of Parent based
upon fraud for the Express Representations.

Section 5.12 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier to occur

disclosure shall eliminate the Companys, on the one hand, or Parents or the
Merger Subs, on the other hand, right, if any, to terminate this Agreement
based on the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the other Party
affected by such disclosure for purposes of determining satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.10_.

 

Section 5.13 _Consent of Stockholders_. Within forty-eight (48) hours of the

Merger Sub the Stockholder Approval, executed and delivered by the requisite

or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including financial
statements) except to the extent arising out of the intentional
misrepresentation, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by the
Company or any of its Representatives.

Section 5.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), including by:
using reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the
Financing Commitments, (ii) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment
Letters, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing no later than the Closing on the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (including any "market
flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_
"), (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub that are within their control contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter (or any definitive agreements related to any Debt Financing)
and (v) enforcing its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or
any definitive document relating to the Applicable Financing.

(b) Parent shall not permit any amendment, supplement or modification to be
made to, or agree to permit any waiver of any provision or remedy under, any
Debt Financing Commitment Letter, Fee Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement
(subject to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter referred
to in the Debt Commitment Letters) without Stockholders Representatives
prior written consent, if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver:
(i) reduces (or has the effect of reducing) the aggregate cash proceeds
contemplated by any Debt Commitment Letter to be funded on the Closing Date
for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (after netting
out original issue discount, upfront fees and other similar premiums and
charges after giving effect to the maximum amount of "market flex" provided
under any Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter) below the

 



49  amount that, together with the Equity Financing and cash available to
Parent, will be sufficient for Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) expands any of the conditions to the receipt or
funding of the Debt Financing or amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing in a manner that results in any
of such conditions being less likely to be satisfied or imposes any new or
additional conditions to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing; (iii)
adversely impacts the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
other parties to any Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or any
Definitive Financing Agreement; or (iv) would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the Closing; _provided_ , that (A) notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Debt Financing Commitment Letters may be amended, restated,
supplemented, modified to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, managers,
agents or similar parties that have not previously executed the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters, and (B) the Debt Financing Commitment Letters may be
amended, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced, including to increase
the amount thereof to be used in lieu of the Equity Financing, if such
amendment, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement complies with
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this sentence. Parent
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide the Stockholders
Representative with copies of any amendment, restatement or replacement or
supplement to, or modification of, any Debt Financing Letter, the Fee Letter
(which may be redacted in a manner consistent with the redacted Fee Letter
delivered on the date hereof) or Definitive Financing Agreement. As used in
this Agreement, references to "Debt Financing Commitment Letters"
shall include any amendment, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement thereof permitted under this _Section 5.15(b)_ and references to
"Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters as permitted to be amended, restated,
supplemented, modified or replaced under this _Section 5.15(b)_.

(c) Nothing in this _Section 5.15_ or any other provision of this Agreement
shall require, and in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of Parent
be deemed or construed to require Parent, to seek the Equity Financing from
any source not party to the Equity Commitment Letter or in any amount in
excess of that contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment, to waive any
term or condition of this Agreement or pay any fees or other amounts in excess
of those contemplated by any Debt Financing Commitment Letter and any related
Fee Letter or commence any legal action or proceeding against any Financing
Source.

 

Section 5.16 _280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to submit to the Stockholders, for approval by the
Stockholders holding the number of Shares required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, a written consent in favor of a single proposal to
render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (collectively, "Section 280G") inapplicable to
any and all payments or benefits provided pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans
or other contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
or is otherwise bound that are reasonably likely to result, separately or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any amount or the provision of any benefit
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G or that would be
subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code (together, the
"Section 280G Payments"). Any such stockholder approval shall be sought by the
Company in a manner that satisfies all applicable requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including
Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of the Treasury Regulations. The form and substance of
all stockholder approval documents contemplated by this Section 5.16,
including the waivers, shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable
approval of Parent which will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

 

Article VI __

_SURVIVAL _

Section 6.1 _Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties in this Agreement or in any document or instrument
delivered by any Party

 



50  pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, and following
the Effective Time, no Party shall be entitled to any recovery in respect of
an inaccuracy or breach thereof or to make any claim whatsoever (including
any claim of detrimental reliance) or to assert any other right or remedy
(whether in contract, in tort or at law or in equity); provided that this
_Section 6.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which
by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time or any claim
based upon fraud for the Express Representations.

 

Article VII

_TERMINATION _

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company, the Stockholders Representative
and Parent; 

(b) by either Parent, on the one hand, or the Company or the Stockholders
Representative, on the other hand, if:

 

(i) any applicable Law is in effect making the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or any final and non-appealable
order is in effect preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to
any Party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of this Agreement results in or causes such order or other action; or

 

(ii) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to September 30,
2015 (the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any Party that is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

(c) by the Company or the Stockholders Representative, if Parent or Merger
Sub breaches any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would render a
condition precedent to the Companys obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 2.10(a)_ or _Section
2.10(c)_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform to Parent by the Company, cannot
be cured or has not been cured by the earlier of the End Date and ten (10)
Business Days after the delivery of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not
be available to the Company or the Stockholders Representative, if the
Company is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement;

 

(d) by Parent, if the Company breaches any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or breaches or fails to perform any of
its covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would render a condition precedent to Parents obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 2.10(a)_ or
_Section 2.10(b)_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving
of written notice of such breach or failure to perform to the Company and the
Stockholders Representative by Parent, cannot be cured or has not been cured
by the earlier of the End Date and ten (10) Business Days after the delivery
of such notice; _provided_ , however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not be available to Parent
if Parent is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;

 



51 (e) by the Company or the Stockholders Representative, if: (i) all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 2.10(a)_ and _Section 2.10(b)_
were satisfied or waived by Parent as of the date the Closing should have been
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (other than those
conditions (x) that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing and could have been satisfied assuming a Closing would occur and
(y) the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach
by Parent or Merger Sub), (ii) the Company has notified Parent that the
Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (iii) Parent fails to complete the Closing within two
(2) Business Days after the delivery of such notification; or

(f) by Parent if the Stockholder Approval, executed and delivered by the
Stockholders, is not obtained within forty-eight (48) hours from the
execution hereof in accordance with _Section 5.13_.

Section 7.2  _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1_, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, and there shall be
no liability hereunder on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Stockholders Representative, except that _Section 5.3_, _Section 5.7_, 
_Section 5.8_, _Article VIII_ and this _Section 7.2_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) no such
termination shall relieve the Company from any liability arising out of or
incurred as a result of its willful and material breach of the terms of this
Agreement prior to such termination and (y) that in the event of termination
by the Company or Stockholders Representative pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)_
or _Section 7.1(e)_, Parent shall be obligated to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_.

 

(b) In the event of termination by the Company or Stockholders Representative
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or  _Section 7.1(e)_, Parent shall promptly,
but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such
termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same
day funds an amount equal to $40,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and subject to the Companys
right to specific performance pursuant to _Section 8.10_, the Termination
Fee, if paid at a time when the Agreement could be terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ (whether or not terminated by the
Company or the Stockholders Representative), shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and any other Person
against Parent and its shareholders, directors, officers and Affiliates and
their respective equityholders, partners, members, directors, officers,
Affiliates and Representatives and the Financing Sources (the " _Parent
Related Parties_ "), and no Parent Related Party shall have any other
liability or obligation for any or all losses suffered or incurred by the
Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (or
the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or
the abandonment thereof), the Financing Commitments and the transactions
contemplated thereby or any matter forming the basis for such termination or
abandonement, and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any other Action or proceeding against Parent or any
other Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or the transactions
contemplated thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination or
abandonment. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_, the right to the Termination Fee
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the losses that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated
damages (and not a penalty). Parent

 



52  acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2(b)_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this
_Section 7.2(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences
a suit that results in a judgment against Parent for the Termination Fee or
portion thereof or any other damages, Parent shall pay to the Company its
costs and expenses thereof (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee or portion
thereof ordered to be paid by a court at the prime rate published in the Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of the payment. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance pursuant to _Section
8.10_ and the payment of the Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and any monetary damages, including all or any portion
of the Termination Fee.

Article VIII __

agreement on the part of any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. No
failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other right.

54 Section 8.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Annexes hereto and the Schedules, contains the entire understanding of the
Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, with respect thereto,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement. No prior drafts of any such
agreements or documents shall be admissible into evidence. The Express
Representations are the exclusive representations and warranties made by the
Company and the Company hereby disclaims any other express or implied
representations or warranties.

Section 8.4 _Non-Recourse;  Release_.

(a) All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected
with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty
made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement) and the
transactions contemplated hereby, may be made, subject to _Article VI_ and
this _Section 8.4_, only against (x) the Persons that are expressly
identified as Parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the " _Contracting
Parties_ ") and (y) the Equity Financing Source (solely in respect of the
Companys right, as an express third party beneficiary to the Equity
Financing Commitment Letter, to specifically enforce Parents right to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms thereof and
_Section 8.10_). For purposes of clarity, the representations and warranties
made by the Company are those solely of the Company (and not of any Nonparty
Affiliates or any other Person, none of whom shall have any liability in
respect thereof) and the representatives and warranties made by Parent and
Merger Sub are those solely of Parent and Merger Sub (and not of any Nonparty
Affiliates or any other Person, none of whom shall have any liability in
respect thereof), it being understood that while the Stockholders
Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to function as the
administrative representative of the Equityholders and, though to the extent
the Stockholders Representative does not comply with or fulfill the
obligations expressly set forth herein to be complied with or fulfilled by
the Stockholders Representative, the other Parties hereto can seek to enforce
specifically such obligations pursuant to _Section 8.10_. The Parties
acknowledge however that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
(x) Parent and Merger Sub are not waiving any right they may have to make a
claim for actual damages for fraud for a misrepresentation in the Express
Representations and, likewise, (y) the Company and the
Stockholders Representative are not waiving any right they may have to make a
claim for fraud for a misrepresentation in _Article IV_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the rights of any Party pursuant to the terms of any
Letter of Transmittal, Option Cancelation Acknowledgement Agreement,
Restrictive Covenant Agreement or employment agreement or any other written
agreement directly entered into in connection with this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall
have any rights or claims against the Financing Sources, in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (b) the Financing Sources shall
not have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



55 Section 8.5 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and, with respect to the
provisions of _Section 5.6_, _Section 5.11_, _Section 7.2_, _Section 8.4_,
_Section 8.8_ and _Section 8.10_ shall inure to the benefit of the Persons
benefiting from the provisions thereof all of whom are intended to be third
party beneficiaries thereof, and the Financing Source Designated Sections
shall inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the Parties without the prior written consent of each of the other
Parties; _provided_ , however, that the Stockholders Representative
may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates without prior written consent and Parent may assign its rights
under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such assignment shall not relieve Parent of any liability or obligation
in connection with this Agreement). Any attempted assignment in violation of
this _Section 8.5_ will be void.

 

Section 8.6 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except by a written instrument executed by all Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 8.6_ and _Sections 7.2_ , _8.2_
, _8.4_ , _8.5_ , _8.8_ and _8.11_ of this Agreement and the definitions
related thereto (solely as used in such sections) (collectively, the "
_Financing Source Designated Sections_ ") may not be amended in a manner
materially adverse to the interests of the Financing Sources without the
written consent of the Financing Sources.

 

Section 8.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered via
fax or email in several counterparts.

 

Section 8.8 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES
THEREOF, EXCEPT THAT THE DGCL SHALL APPLY TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION
WITH THE MERGER. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN
THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY AND THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND
AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (I) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO
THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (II) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY IS
IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS OR (III) ANY ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN
_SECTION 8.2_ , OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL BE
VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO
SERVICE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER HEREIN PROVIDED. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS
_SECTION 8.8_ , WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR
DESCRIPTION (WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY AND WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE (OTHER THAN ANY AFFILIATES OF THE
PARENT) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING, THE
DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE

 



56  PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT
(I) ANY ACTION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) OR PROCEEDING
INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE
TO ANY FINANCING, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION (INCLUDING ANY DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER) IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW WHICH
WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION, (II) SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR ANY NEW
YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN AND ANY APPELLATE COURT
THEREFROM, (III) IT SHALL NOT BRING ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST SUCH
FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY OTHER COURTS, (IV) IT WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST SUCH FINANCING SOURCES AND (V) IT WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT, BY WAY
OF MOTION, DEFENSE OR OTHERWISE, IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST SUCH
FINANCING SOURCES, ANY CLAIM THAT IT IS NOT SUBJECT PERSONALLY TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE ABOVE-NAMED COURTS, THAT THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM OR THAT THE VENUE OF THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING
IS IMPROPER. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ANY PARTY MAY BRING AN ACTION IN A
COURT OTHER THAN ONE OF THE ABOVE-NAMED COURTS TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OF THE
ABOVE-NAMED COURTS.

Section 8.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and
enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term, provision, covenant or restriction or any portion thereof had never
been contained herein. Upon such a determination, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 8.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be
inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties and
the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any Order sought by the Company and/or the Stockholders
Representative to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to perform its agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or
threatened breach. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.10_ and each Party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. Each Party further agrees that the only
permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable
relief is that it contests the existence of a

 



57  breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that (i) the Company or the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded (and to seek an injunction or specific performance of
the Equity Financing Sources obligation to fund the Equity Financing
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter) to fund the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to consummate the Closing only in the event
that (a) all conditions in _Section 2.10(a)_ and  _Section 2.10(b)_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are required
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing provided such conditions could
be satisfied)) and Parent fails to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, (b) the financing provided for by the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (c) the Company has confirmed
that it is ready, willing and able to satisfy the conditions to the Parents
obligation to close and to consummate the Closing if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded and (ii) the
Equity Financing may only be required to fund and Parent may only be required
to close pursuant to an injunction or Order of specific performance if
the Debt Financing shall simultaneously or previously be funded. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the Companys or the
Stockholders Representatives right to seek specific performance pursuant to
this  _Section 8.10_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Companys right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and/or seek payment of
the Termination Fee.

 

Section 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND
AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 8.12 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document. Exhibits
and Schedules to this Agreement are attached hereto and by this reference
incorporated herein for all purposes. Any reference in this Agreement to an
"Article," "Exhibit," "Section," "Schedule," or "subsection" refers to the
corresponding Article, Exhibit, Section, Schedule or subsection of or to this
Agreement, unless expressly provided otherwise. The table of contents and the
headings of Articles, Exhibits, Sections, or subsections of this Agreement are
for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement and shall
be disregarded in construing the language herein. All words used in
this Agreement are to be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances and context require. The words "this Agreement," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar import, refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless
expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this Section" and "this
subsection," and words of similar import, refer only to the Article, Section
or subsection hereof in which such words occur. The word "or" is exclusive,
and the word "including" (in its various forms) means including without
limitation. Where this Agreement states that a party "shall," "will" or
"must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means the
party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any
reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor
legislation as in effect at the relevant time. All references to "$" and

Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action
(and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be
given or action taken) shall be the next date which is a Business Day. Any
notice required hereunder shall be in writing.

 



58 Section 8.13 _Schedules_. Matters reflected in the Schedules are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
the Schedules. To the extent any such additional matters are included, they
are included for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. Headings and subheadings have been inserted in
the Schedules for convenience of reference only and shall not have the effect
of amending or changing the express description thereof as set forth in this
Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item in this Agreement or any Schedule
referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure would apply to such other Sections. Neither the specification
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is
intended to imply that such amounts, higher or lower amounts, or the item so
included or other items, are or are not material or are within or outside the
ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
forth of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in any
Schedule in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter is or is not required to be disclosed (including,
whether such amounts or items are or are not material), or may constitute an
event or condition which could be considered to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No matter or item disclosed on a Schedule admitting or indicating a
possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or Order shall be construed
as an admission or indication that an actual breach or violation exists, has
actually occurred or will occur. The Parties do not assume any responsibility
to any Person that is not a Party to this Agreement for the accuracy of
any information set forth in the Schedules. Subject to applicable Law, the
information on the Schedules is disclosed in confidence for the purposes
contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to the confidentiality
provisions of any other agreements, including the Confidentiality Agreement,
entered into by the Parties or their Affiliates. Moreover, in disclosing the
information in the Schedules, each Party expressly does not waive any
attorney-client privilege associated with such information or any protection
afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters
disclosed or discussed therein.

consents and amendments under this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby as the Stockholders Representative, in
its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (ii) as the

Representatives regarding such claims, and, in connection therewith, to (A)
assert any claim or institute any Action or investigation; (B) investigate,

relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that such waiver is in writing
signed by the Stockholders Representative; (iv) to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders,
receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock
powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things
and to take any and all action that the Stockholders Representative, in its
sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient

Agreement; (v) to engage outside counsel, accountants and other advisors and
incur such other expenses on behalf of the Equityholders in connection with
any matter arising under this Agreement; and (vi) to collect, hold and

hereunder except through the Stockholders Representative.

 

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to receive
reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Equityholders for certain
expenses, charges and liabilities as provided below. In connection with this
Agreement, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers
conferred upon the Stockholders Representative hereunder, (i)
the Stockholders Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any Equityholders by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted
hereunder, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which
represents willful misconduct, and (ii) the Stockholders Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or
other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any act or
omission of the Stockholders Representative pursuant to such advice shall in
no event subject the Stockholders Representative to liability to any
Equityholders. Each Equityholder shall indemnify, severally and not jointly,
based on such Equityholders pro rata share of Merger Consideration received
by such Equityholder, the Stockholders Representative against all losses,
damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of
any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or
relating to any acts or omissions of the Stockholders Representative
hereunder. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any
Action which finally adjudicates the liability of the Stockholders
Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. The Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to recover, at its sole discretion, from
the Expense Holdback Amount, prior to any distribution to the Equityholders,
any amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the expense reimbursement and
indemnification provisions of this _Section 8.14(b)_.

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Stockholders
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and/or
any termination of this Agreement.

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally
binding upon the Equityholders. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person (including
any Equityholder or any Stockholder Indemnified Party) for any acts done by
them in accordance with any written notice, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Representative.

 

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Equityholder and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, and any action taken by the Stockholders

 



60  Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Agreement shall be
effective and binding on each Equityholder notwithstanding any contrary action
of or direction from such Equityholder, except for actions or omissions of
the Stockholders Representative constituting willful misconduct.

(f) The Stockholders Representative has the limited partnership authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform the limited administrative
responsibilities hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Stockholders Representative has been duly authorized in
accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the Stockholders
Representative. No other limited partnership action on the part of the
Stockholders Representative is necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Stockholders
Representative. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered the
Stockholders Representative and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the other Parties, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Stockholders Representative enforceable against the
Stockholders Representative in accordance with its terms, except for the
Enforceability Exceptions.

(g) By the Stockholders Representatives signature to this Agreement, the
Stockholders Representative hereby accepts the appointment contained in this
Agreement, as confirmed and extended by this Agreement, and agrees to act as
the Stockholders Representative and to discharge the duties of the
Stockholders Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 8.15 _Legal Representation_. Parent and the Company hereby agree, on
their own behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and their current
and future directors, managers, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates and each of their successors and assigns (all such
Persons, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that KandE (or any successor thereto) may
represent the Stockholders Representative or any of the other Equityholders,
or any of their respective, direct or indirect, directors, managers, members,
partners, officers, employees, equityholders or Affiliates thereof, in
connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any agreement entered into in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby (any
such representation to be hereinafter referred to as the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ ") notwithstanding its prior representation of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary thereof, and each of Parent and the Company on behalf
of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and waives (and
will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom
or relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
hereof, no conflict of interest or objection is waived arising from any
representation other than solely representation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prior to Closing. Each of Parent and the Company, for itself and
the Waiving Parties, hereby acknowledges and agrees that all communications
that are subject to the attorney-client privilege and/or the attorney work
product doctrine or otherwise in furtherance of the provision of legal
services among KandE, the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders
Representative and/or any Equityholder and/or any Representative of any of the
foregoing made in connection with, and concerning the subject matter of, the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection herewith, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, are privileged communications and the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs solely to the
Stockholders Representative and/or Equityholder, as applicable and, subject
to the exceptions set forth below, shall be exclusively controlled thereby and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and
from and after the Closing none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Subsidiary thereof or any other Person purporting to act on behalf thereof or
any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing: (a) nothing contained in this _Section
8.15_ shall be deemed a waiver of control by Parent or the Company or any
Company Subsidiary over any applicable privileges or protections that can or
may be asserted to prevent disclosure to any third party of any communications
between or among KandE, the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders

 



61  Representative and/or any Equityholder and/or any Representative; (b)
nothing herein shall prevent Parent or the Company or any Company Subsidiary
from requesting, using or accessing all communications between or among KandE,
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders Representative and/or
any Equityholder and/or any Representative in connection with any claim
arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise, so long as such communications are not
subject to the attorney-client privilege or work product protection or
otherwise in furtherance of the provision of legal services; and (c) in the
event that a dispute or investigation or audit arises after the Closing
between Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a
third party, on the other hand, Parent or the Company shall notify the
Stockholders Representative if Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
requires access to any privileged or protected communications between KandE, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders Representative and/or any
Equityholder and/or any Representative in order to assist in the response to
or defense of the third-party claim, investigation, or audit; _provided_ , to
the extent such information is shared it shall be presumed to have been shared
pursuant to the common interest doctrine. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, for purposes of determining whether certain communications involving
a KandE attorney providing legal services between or among Persons are entitled
to the attorney-client privilege, it shall be presumed that all
communications between such KandE attorney, on the one hand, and the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders Representative or any Equityholders
and/or any Representative thereof in connection with, and concerning the
subject matter of, the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any matter relating
to the foregoing, in each case, are communications in which legal services
were sought and which communications were intended to be confidential.
