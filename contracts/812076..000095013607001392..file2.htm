At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company:   (a) Merger Consideration. Each share of the common stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a "Share") issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting  Shares, Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned or held in treasury by  the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the  Company (each, an "Excluded Share")) shall be converted into the right to  receive $9.75 per Share in cash, less any required withholding Taxes as  described in Section 4.2(f) and without interest (the "Per Share Merger  Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to  be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each  certificate formerly representing any of the Shares (each, a  "Certificate") (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall  thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger  Consideration, without interest.   (b) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Each Excluded Share  referred to in Section 4.1(a) (other than Dissenting Shares, which are  addressed in clause (d) below), by virtue of the Merger and without any  action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding,  shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall  cease to exist.   (c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common  stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share  of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder  thereof who has validly demanded payment of the fair value for such Shares  as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the  "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for  the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead shall  be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving  Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the  DGCL, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall  have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder\'s right under the DGCL. If  any such holder of Shares shall have failed to perfect or shall have  effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each Share of such holder shall  be treated, at the Company\'s sole discretion, as a Share that had been  converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share  Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 4.1(a). The Company shall  give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands (and any written  withdrawals thereof) received by the Company for appraisal of Shares  pursuant to    - 4 -     Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to reasonably  participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such  demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of  Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or waive any rights  with respect to, any such demands. Any portion of the Per Share Merger  Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section  4.1(d) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected  shall be returned to Parent upon demand.   4.2 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Paying Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall  deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by  Parent with the Company\'s prior written approval (such approval not to be  unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of  the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds  necessary for the Paying Agent to make all payments under Section 4.1(a)  (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The  Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guarantied by  the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A1 or  P1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s  Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from  such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts  in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly  returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are losses  with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for  any reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment under  Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,  promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure  that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to  make such payments required under Section 4.1(a).   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,  Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of  Shares (other than holders of Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) (i) a  letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only  upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof  as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of  transmittal to be in such form and to have such other provisions as Parent  and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in  effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu  thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the applicable Per  Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit  of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent  in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, and such  letter of transmittal having been duly executed, the holder of such  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash  amount in immediately available funds (less any required Tax withholdings  as provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal to (A) the number of Shares  represented by such    - 5 -     Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section  4.2(e)), multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the  Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled and extinguished  of no further force or effect. No interest will accrue or be paid on any  amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a  transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer  records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due  surrender of the Certificate may be issued to the transferee of such  Shares if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented  to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to  evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable  stock transfer taxes or other Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.   (c) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there  shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the  Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,  after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving  Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be  cancelled and extinguished and exchanged for the Per Share Merger  Consideration (payable in cash in immediately available funds) to which  the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.   (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the  Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that  remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after  the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any  holder of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) who has  not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only  to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger  Consideration (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section  4.2(f)) upon due surrender of each of its Certificates (or affidavits of  loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)), without any interest  thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,  Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former  holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official  pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For  the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean any  individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability  company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,  Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.   (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any  Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of  an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be  lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such  Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be  reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be  made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such  Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (less any  required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal to the  number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate  multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.    - 6 -     (f) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the  Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and  withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this  Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Company Options, such  amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the  making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended  (the "Code"), or any other applicable Tax. To the extent that amounts are  so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (i) shall be  remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying  Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to  the holder of Shares or holder of Company Options in respect of which such  deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Surviving  Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be.   4.3 Treatment of Stock Plans.   (a) Options. At the Effective Time: (i) each outstanding  Company Option under the 1996 Stock Plan and the 2001 Stock Plan shall  become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive,  as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any  event no later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), an  amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares  subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,  multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger  Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option,  less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such  payment; and (ii) each outstanding Company Option under the Director Stock  Plan shall become fully vested and be automatically converted into the  right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective  Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of  Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective  Time, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger  Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option,  less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such  payment. As used herein, the term "Company Option" shall mean any  outstanding option to purchase Shares under any Stock Plan. As of the  Effective Time, each Company Option for which the exercise price per Share  exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration, other than Company Options  outstanding under the Director Stock Plan (the "Director Options"), shall  be canceled and have no further effect, with no right to receive any  consideration. As of the Effective Time, all other Company Options (other  than the Director Options) shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically cease to exist and shall become only the right to receive  the option consideration described in this Section 4.3(a), and, without  limiting the foregoing, the board of directors of the Company or the  appropriate committee thereof shall take all action necessary to effect  such cancellation.   (b) Corporate Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time,  the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation  committee of the board of    - 7 -     directors of the Company, as applicable, shall (to the extent necessary)  adopt resolutions to implement the provisions of Section 4.3(a), it being  understood that the intention of the parties is that following the  Effective Time no holder of any Company Options or any participant in any  Stock Plan or other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have  any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any phantom  stock or stock appreciation right) of the Company, any Subsidiary of  either the Company or Parent, or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the  Closing, the Company shall deliver to the holders of the Company Options  appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to this  Agreement.   4.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), division or subdivision of Shares, stock dividend or distribution, consolidation of Shares, reclassification, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time (it being understood that the Company shall not be obligated hereby or otherwise to terminate or cancel any outstanding Director Options).   ARTICLE V   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   5.1 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other section of the Company Disclosure Schedule if (i) it is readily apparent from such disclosure that it applies to such other section or (ii) such disclosure is cross-referenced in such other section), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:   (a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification.

Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists  each Subsidiary and every other Person in which the Company or any  Subsidiary has any ownership interest, together    - 8 -     with their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization.

(b) Capital Structure.

The Company acknowledges that Parent does not and will not waive any rights it may have under this Agreement as a result of such notice or consultations.   6.2 Acquisition Proposals.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to  the contrary, during the period beginning on the Effective Date and  continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the 40th day thereafter  (the "Solicitation Period End-Date"), the Company and its directors (to  the extent acting in their capacity as such), officers, employees,  Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors  or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") shall have the right  to directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Acquisition  Proposals, including by way of providing access to non-public information  pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality  Agreements, provided that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any  non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is  provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided  to or made available to Parent; and (ii) enter into and maintain  discussions or negotiations with respect to potential Acquisition  Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or  facilitate, any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations.    - 35 -     As used herein, the term: (A) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, offer or proposal made by a Person or group at any time relating to any direct or indirect acquisition of (i) more than 25% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company, (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning more than 25% of any class of outstanding equity securities of the Company, or (iv) any merger, consolidation or other business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the Merger; and (B) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall mean a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements.   (b) Subject to Section 6.2(c) and except with respect to any  Person who made an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company prior to  the Solicitation Period End-Date with respect to which the requirements of  Sections 6.2(c)(i), 6.2(c)(iii) and 6.2(c)(iv) have been satisfied as of  the Solicitation Period End-Date and thereafter continuously through the  date of determination, from the Solicitation Period End-Date until the  Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in  accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall not, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i)  initiate, or solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by  way of providing information) the making, submission or announcement of  any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be  expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions  or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with  or knowingly assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate or  knowingly encourage any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or  negotiations or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to  approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger  agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase  agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option  agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal  or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the  Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or propose or  agree to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding anything contained in  Section 6.2 to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an  Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement with respect to any  Acquisition Proposal immediately at such time as such Acquisition Proposal  made by such party is withdrawn, terminated or fails in the reasonable  determination of the board of directors of the Company to satisfy the  requirements of Sections 6.2(c)(i), 6.2(c)(ii), 6.2(c)(iii) and  6.2(c)(iv).   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  Section 6.2(b), if at any time following the date of this Agreement and  prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote (i) the Company has received  a written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the board of  directors of the Company believes in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such  Acquisition Proposal did not occur as a result of a breach of this Section  6.2, (iii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith,  after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that  such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or may reasonably be expected to  result in a Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation with its outside  counsel, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith  that the failure to take such actions or any of the actions described in  the following clauses (A) and (B) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary  duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the  Company may (A) furnish information (including non-public information)  with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such  Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations  with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such  Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company (x) gives Parent written  notice of the identity of such Person and of the Company\'s intention to  furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person at  least one Business Day prior to furnishing any such information to, or  entering into discussions with, such Person, (y) will not, and will not  allow its Subsidiaries or Representatives to disclose any non-public  information to such Person without first entering or having entered into  an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (z) contemporaneously with  making available any such information with such Person provide to Parent  any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to  such other Person which was not previously provided to or made available  to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section  6.2(b) or this Section 6.2(c), prior to obtaining the Requisite Company  Vote, the Company shall    - 37 -     in any event be permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and  (B) above with respect to any Excluded Party for so long as they are an  Excluded Party.   As used herein, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages included in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" increased to 60% for purposes of this definition) made in writing that (A) is on terms that the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s outside counsel and financial advisor) are more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than this Agreement, after giving effect to any modifications (if any) proposed to be made to this Agreement or any other offer by Parent after Parent\'s receipt of notice under Section 6.2(e), and (B) which the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s outside counsel and financial advisor) is reasonably likely to be consummated (if accepted). The foregoing determinations shall be made after consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor and outside counsel after taking into account all appropriate legal, financial (including the financing terms of such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.   (d) Within 24 hours following the Solicitation Period  End-Date (or, with respect to any Excluded Party who is determined to be  an Excluded Party following the Solicitation Period End-Date in accordance  with Section 6.2(b)(B), within 24 hours of such determination), the  Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Excluded  Party and of the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal  received from such Excluded Party. From and after the Solicitation Period  End-Date, in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or  Representatives receives any of the following, the Company shall promptly  (but not more than one Business Day after such receipt) notify Parent  thereof: (i) any Acquisition Proposal or written indication by any Person  that would reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal  (and provide the material terms and conditions thereof); (ii) any request  (other than from an Excluded Party, it being understood that the Company  shall continue to comply with its obligations under Section 6.2(a)(i) with  respect to such Excluded Party) for non-public information relating to the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in  the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal;  or (iii) any inquiry or request for (other than from or by an Excluded  Party) discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal.  Without limitation of Section 6.2(b), following the Solicitation Period  End-Date, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a current basis (and  in any event no later than one Business Day after the occurrence of any  significant changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the  status of any Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request  (including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any material  modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and  negotiations, including furnishing copies of any material written  inquiries and correspondence, in all cases whether in connection with an  Excluded Party or third party pursuant to Section 6.2(c)(B). Without  limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within one Business  Day) notify Parent if it determines to provide non-public information or  to engage in discussions or negotiations    - 38 -     concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.2(c) other than  with an Excluded Party, in each case after the Solicitation Period  End-Date. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,  enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the  date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such  information to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its  Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of,  or grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality  agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the  Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to enforce the provisions  of any such agreement; provided, however, that the Company may permit a  proposal to be made under a standstill agreement if its board of directors  determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that  the Company\'s failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary  duties of the board of directors to the stockholders of the Company under  applicable Law.   (e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.2(b)(ii) to the  contrary, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the board  of directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation  with outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior  Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of  this Agreement which may be offered by Parent, including pursuant to  clause (ii) below, the board of directors of the Company may at any time  prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if it determines in good  faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take  such action or any of the actions described in the following clauses (x),  (y) and (z) would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board  of directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x)  withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or  qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company  Recommendation (a "Change of Company Recommendation"), (y) approve or  recommend such Superior Proposal, and/or (z) terminate this Agreement to  enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;  provided, however, that the board of directors of the Company may not  withdraw, modify or amend the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse  to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (x), approve or recommend such  Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) or terminate this  Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) (it being agreed that any  such purported termination shall be null and void and of no effect) unless  (A) such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of  this Section 6.2, (B) with respect to clause (z) above, the Company pays  the applicable Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(c), and  (C):   (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice  to Parent, of its intention to take any action contemplated in Section  6.2(e) with respect to a Superior Proposal at least four Business Days in  advance of taking such action (the "Notice Period"), which notice shall  set forth the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal  (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and  shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed  transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and  other material documents,    - 39 -     including the then-current form of each definitive agreement with respect  to such Superior Proposal (each, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement");  and   (ii) prior to effecting such Change of Company  Recommendation, approving or recommending such Superior Proposal or  terminating this Agreement to enter into a proposed definitive agreement  with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent  the opportunity to submit an amended written proposal or to make a new  written proposal to the board of directors of the Company during the  Notice Period and shall itself and shall cause its Representatives to,  during the Notice Period, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the  extent Parent so requests in writing) to make such adjustments to the  terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal  ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any subsequent  material revisions to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver a  new written notice to Parent and comply with the requirements of this  Section 6.2(e), and the Notice Period shall recommence.   (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without  limitation, this Section 6.2) shall prohibit the board of directors of the  Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company  a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under  the Exchange Act, or (ii) disclosing the fact that the board of directors  of the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal and the terms of such  proposal, if the board of directors of the Company determines, after  consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take any  such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under  applicable Law or to comply with obligations under federal securities Laws  or NASDAQ or the rules and regulations of any U.S. securities exchange  upon which the capital stock of the Company is listed; provided, however,  that any such disclosures (other than "stop, look and listen" letters or  similar communications of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the  Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Company Recommendation  (including for purposes of Section 8.1(g)) unless the board of directors  of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms its Company Recommendation not  more than five Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so  (provided that, if such written notice is delivered to the Company less  than five Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting, the board of  directors of the Company shall so reaffirm its Company Recommendation at  least one Business Day prior to the Stockholders Meeting).   6.3 No Change in Company Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Other than in accordance with Section 6.2, and except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.3, the board of directors of the Company shall not:   (a) withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or  publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in  a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the  Merger; or    - 40 -     (b) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or  recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or cause or permit the Company to enter  into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent,  agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement  or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement  relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or  agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail  to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its  obligations hereunder or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the  foregoing;  provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company shall have the right to withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, if the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided that, (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent of its board of directors\' intention to take any such action at least four Business Days in advance thereof, (ii) the Company shall provide Parent the opportunity to submit an amended written proposal or to make a new written proposal to the board of directors of the Company and shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent so requests in writing) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as could reasonably be expected to prevent such change in Company Recommendation during such four Business Day period, and (iii) the board of directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after considering any such amended or new written proposal and after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to so withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.   6.4 Proxy Statement.   (a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as  promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event  no later than 40 days following the date hereof), a proxy statement in  preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy  statement, including any amendment or supplement and any schedules and  exhibits thereto, the "Proxy Statement").

(c) Parent shall cause any information supplied by it or  Merger Sub or any of their respective representatives for inclusion or  incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, at the time that the  Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at  the time of the Stockholders Meeting, to not contain any untrue statement  of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in  the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   6.5 Stockholders Meeting.
