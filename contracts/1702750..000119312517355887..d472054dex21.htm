(the " _Company_ ").

Recitals

 

A. _The Proposed Transaction_. Upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the parties intend to effect a strategic business combination
pursuant to which Merger Sub, a newly formed, direct, wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent, will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). The
Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). It is the intention of Parent that, (a) immediately following
the Merger, the Company will merge with and into Parent, with Parent being the
surviving corporation (the " _Parent Merger_ ") and (b) immediately following
the Parent Merger, First Bank and Trust, an Illinois state chartered bank and
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (" _Company Bank Sub_ "), will merge
with and into Byline Bank, an Illinois state chartered bank and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank Sub_ "), with Parent Bank Sub being
the surviving bank (the " _Bank Merger_ "). The Parent Merger and the Bank
Merger sometimes are collectively referred to herein as the " _Subsequent
Mergers_ ".

B. _Board Determinations_. The respective boards of directors of the Company
and Parent have each determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are in the best interests of their respective
stockholders, and, therefore, have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

C. _Intended Tax Treatment_. The parties intend the Merger and the Parent
Merger to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a single integrated
transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
") (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). The parties intend that this Agreement
be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

D. _Company Voting Agreements_. As an inducement to and condition of Parents
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain directors, officers and
shareholders of the Company are concurrently entering into voting agreements,
the form of which has been Previously Disclosed (the " _Company Voting
Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, such persons agree to
vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of approval of this
Agreement, the Merger and any other matters required to be approved or adopted
in order to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the mutual

THE MERGER

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub
will terminate. The Company will be the Surviving Corporation and will
continue its existence under the laws of the State of Illinois. As a result
of the Merger, the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
in the main office of Parent located at 180 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago,
Illinois, at a time and on a business day designated by Parent and as
consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) that is five (5) business days (or, if fewer than five
(5) business days remain prior to the Outside Date, such fewer number of days)
after the satisfaction or waiver of the latest to occur of the conditions set
forth in Article 7, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions (the " _Closing Date_ "), unless another date, time or place is
mutually agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The parties hereto
shall cause articles of merger with respect to the Merger (" _Articles of
Merger_ ") to be drafted and executed prior to the Closing Date and filed on
the Closing Date with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois, all in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the IBCA. The time on the Closing
Date at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_ ".

2.3 _Effects of the Merger; Liabilities of the Company_. The Merger will have
the effects prescribed by applicable Law, including the IBCA.

2.4 _Name of Surviving Corporation; Directors and Officers_. The name of
the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time will be the name of the
Company. The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

2.5 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation_. The
Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company
Articles_ "), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, in each
case, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be the articles
of incorporation and by-laws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation as of
the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



12 2.6 _The Subsequent Mergers_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent will cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to effect
the Subsequent Mergers and the Conversion immediately following the Effective
Time. Such cooperation shall include (a) the approval and entry into a merger
agreement for the Parent Merger substantially in the form attached as Annex 1
hereto, (b) the approval and entry into a merger agreement for the Bank Merger
substantially in the form attached as Annex 2 hereto and (c) the filing of
all applications for all regulatory approvals and certificates required to
give effect thereto. At the respective effective times of the Parent Merger
and the Bank Merger, the separate existence of the Company and the Company
Bank Sub, respectively, will terminate. Parent will be the surviving
corporation in the Parent Merger (the " _Parent Merger Surviving Company_ ")
and will continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware, and
Parent Bank Sub will be the surviving bank in the Bank Merger (the " _Bank
Merger Surviving Bank_ ") and will continue its existence under the laws of

of Parent in effect immediately prior to the Parent Merger will be the

Sub in effect immediately prior to the Bank Merger will be the by-laws of the
Bank Merger Surviving Bank. The officers and directors of Parent
Merger Surviving Company and Bank Merger Surviving Bank will be the officers
and directors, respectively, of Parent and Bank immediately prior to
consummation of the Parent Merger and Bank Merger; provided, however, Mr.
Robert Yohanan will be added to the board of directors of each of (1) Parent
as of immediately following the Effective Time and Parent Merger Surviving
Company as of immediately following to the effective time of the Parent
Merger, and (2) Bank as of immediately following the Effective Time and Bank
Merger Surviving Bank as of immediately following to the effective time of the
Bank Merger, provided, further, that if Mr. Robert Yohanan is unable or
unwilling to serve in any such capacity at such times, one current member of
the Company Board, as mutually agreed to by Parent and Company, will be added
to the such boards of directors at such times in lieu of Mr. Robert Yohanan.
In the Subsequent Mergers, the shares of the entity not surviving the merger
shall be cancelled and the shares of the entity surviving the merger shall
remain outstanding and not be affected thereby.

 

ARTICLE 3

EFFECT ON STOCK

3.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and
without any action by any holder of Company Stock:

(a) Company Common Stock.

 

(1) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Common Shares and

 



13  Dissenting Common Shares, including each share issued pursuant to an award,
made prior to the date hereof, in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
that are subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted
under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") will be converted into
and constitute the right to receive the following " _Per Common Share
Consideration_ ": (i) 3.994 fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); and (ii) a cash payment in the
amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) $27,000,000 by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cash Consideration_ ").

 

(2) Shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist, and no consideration shall be payable for
any Excluded Common Shares. Holders of shares of Company Common Stock will
cease to be, and will have no rights as, shareholders of the Company,
and certificates that represented shares of Company Common Stock before the
Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to
receive, without interest, (A) any then unpaid dividend or other distribution
with respect to such Company Common Stock having a record date before the
Effective Time and (B) the consideration payable in respect of such Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Article 3\. After the Effective Time, there will
be no transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and shares of Company Common
Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation will be canceled and exchanged in
accordance with this Article 3\.

 

(b) _Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of
the Surviving Corporation.

3.2 _Company Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Company to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
shall, without any further action on the part of Parent, the Company, or the
holder thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be assumed and converted automatically into an option
(each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B)
the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash Consideration by the volume
weighted average price of one shares of Parent Common Stock as reported on the
NYSE for the five business days ending on the business day immediately prior
to the Closing Date (the " _Parent Closing Price_ ") (such sum in clause (ii)
being referred to as the " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Each Adjusted
Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to
(x) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option immediately
prior

 



14  to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Adjusted Option shall be fully
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 3.2, each Adjusted Option shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Option
under the applicable Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder. The parties intend that the assumption of the Company Stock
Options shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of
Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, and this Section 3.2 shall be construed consistent with this
intent.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Company, the Board of Directors of
Company or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this Section 3.2. On or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall amend the Company Stock Plan and, if necessary, use commercially
reasonable efforts to amend each outstanding stock option agreement entered
into by the Company pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, (i) to eliminate any
right of the holder of Company Stock Options to seek to have their Company
Stock Options redeemed, repurchased or cashed out by the Company pursuant to
Section 8(a)(ii) of the Company Stock Plan, (ii) to provide Covered Employees
(as defined below) who hold Company Stock Options and whose employment is
terminated a thirty (30) day period following such termination to exercise any
then-outstanding, vested Company Stock Options (unless a longer post-
termination period applies pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plan or
applicable award agreement) and (iii) to provide the current directors of
Company who hold Company Stock Options and whose service as a director will
terminate as of the Effective Time the right to exercise any then-
outstanding, vested Company Stock Options until the tenth (10th) anniversary
of the date of grant of such Company Stock Option.

 

(c) Parent shall (i) take such actions as are reasonably necessary to reserve
for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options and (ii) file with
the SEC, no later than the Closing Date, a post-effective amendment to Form
S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form)
relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
Adjusted Options, which registration statement(s) shall remain effective for
so long as the Adjusted Options are outstanding.

3.3 _Exchange Agent_ _._

 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with its transfer
agent or with a depository or trust institution of recognized standing
selected by it and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in such capacity,
the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "
_Old Certificates_ "), (1) evidence of shares in book entry form (such book
entry shares, " _New Certificates_ "), representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to holders of Old Certificates under this Article 3 and
(2) an amount equal to the aggregate cash payable to holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.4 (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



15 (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in
no event later than ten (10) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock, a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the
consideration payable pursuant to this Article 3\. No interest will accrue or
be paid with respect to any New Certificate or cash to be delivered upon
surrender of Old Certificates. If any New Certificate is to be issued or cash
is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the
exchange that the Old Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form of transfer, and that the person requesting the exchange (1) pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the
New Certificate or the making of the cash payment in a name other than the
name of the holder of the surrendered Old Certificate or (2) establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be)
that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
having a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of
Company Common Stock until such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate
representing such stock as provided herein. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall
be paid to the holder of New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously payable with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, holders of Company Common Stock who receive Parent Common Stock in the
Merger shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of
Parent stockholders the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into
which their respective shares of Company Common Stock are converted,
regardless of whether such holders of Company Common Stock have exchanged
their Old Certificates for New Certificates in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement.

(d) Parent shall be entitled to rely upon the Companys stock transfer books
and the Companys register to establish the identity of those persons entitled
to receive consideration pursuant to this Article 3, which books and register
shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with
respect to ownership of stock represented by any Old Certificate, Parent shall
be entitled to deposit the full consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party providing for the payment to the owner of
such consideration upon resolution of such ownership and thereafter be
relieved from any and all liability and obligation with respect to any claims
thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party hereto
shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered in good faith to a public official in accordance with
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



16 (e) Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect to whom such deduction and withholding was made. If any holder of an
Old Certificate requests payment of any cash such person is entitled to
pursuant to this Article 3 by means of a wire transfer in his, her or its duly
executed and completed letter of transmittal, the Exchange Agent may
make payment of such cash such holder is entitled to hereunder by wire
transfer in accordance with such request and the cost of any such wire
transfer shall be charged to the account of and deducted from the proceeds
paid to such holder hereunder.

 

(f) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion
of the Exchange Fund which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Old Certificates (including, without limitation,
all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all
cash funds made available to it), and thereafter holders of Old Certificates
shall be entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) with respect to any payment that may be payable upon
due surrender of the Old Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder
of an Old Certificate for any payment delivered in good faith in respect of
such Old Certificate to a public official in accordance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

3.4 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or
scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. Instead, Parent will pay, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) business days thereafter, to each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such
holder) an amount in cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock by
the Parent Closing Price.

 

3.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash,
unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate been surrendered.

 

3.6 _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If Parent changes (or the board of directors
of Parent sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective
Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend,

 



17  recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or other transaction, the
Per Common Share Consideration will be adjusted appropriately and
proportionately to give holders of capital stock of Company the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

3.7 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled to dissenters rights under Section 11.65 of the IBCA, Dissenting
Common Shares that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will not be
converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof unless and until the
holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost, his, her or its right to dissent from the Merger under the IBCA. The
holder of any Dissenting Common Share shall be treated in accordance with
Section 11.70 of the IBCA and, as applicable, shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 11.70 of the
IBCA with respect thereto. Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on all notices or other communications to be sent to
holders of Dissenting Common Shares, and the Company shall consider in good
faith any comments of Parent and revise such notices or communications as may
be appropriate. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice of any notice
or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of demand for payment and any other similar instruments received by
the Company and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices at Parents cost and
expense. The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle
any such demands or notices or make or offer to make any payment in respect
of any such demands or notices. Parent will pay any consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to Dissenting Common Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of applicable Law.

 

3.8 _Tangible Common Equity Calculation_

 

(a) Not later than ten (10) days before the expected Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent an estimated and unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company, as of the expected Closing Date (the " _Company_ _Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which shall (1) be prepared in good faith based on
all available information at such time pursuant to GAAP and this Agreement
and Disclosure Schedule 1.1, and (2) include a calculation of Company Tangible
Common Equity as of the expected Closing Date.

 

(b) After delivery of the Company Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Parties
shall work together in good faith, which in the case of the Company shall
include providing Parent with such documentation and information in its
possession or control as Parent shall reasonably request, to agree by the

such qualification, except for any failure to be so qualified that would not,

contained in 12 C.F.R. Part 363 (the " _FDICIA Reporting Requirements_ "), and
the Company is in the process of ensuring compliance therewith. To the
Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances which exist which
would reasonably be expected to cause the Company to not be in compliance in
all material respects with the FDICIA Reporting Requirements for the
Companys 2017 fiscal year.

Property owned, or purported to be owned, by it, free and clear of all Liens.

owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not terminate or alter the
terms pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted to
use any Intellectual Property licensed from third parties and will not create
any rights by third parties to use any Intellectual Property owned by Parent,

in, to or under any such Intellectual Property.

pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure and/or license agreements
which have not been breached. All material Intellectual Property developed
under contract by, for or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has been assigned to the Company or such Subsidiary, other than any
Intellectual Property which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries engaged a
non-employee third-party to develop that the Company or such Subsidiary does

longer used in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries business as presently
conducted, was licensed to use.

three (3) years. To the Companys Knowledge, the IT Assets do not contain any
"time bombs", "Trojan horses", "back doors", "trap doors", "worms", viruses,
bugs, faults or other devices or effects that (A) enable or assist any person
to access without authorization the IT Assets, or (B) otherwise significantly
adversely affect the functionality of the IT Assets. To the Companys
Knowledge, no person has gained unauthorized access to the IT Assets. The
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain and utilize the IT Assets in accordance
with all applicable licenses, agreements and other Contracts. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain reasonable backup, security and
disaster recovery technology. The Company and its Subsidiaries take

(t) _Benefit Arrangements_.

 

(1) The Company has Previously Disclosed a complete and correct list of all
Company Benefit Arrangements, including Company Benefit Arrangements that are

Knowledge, threatened, litigation relating to the Company Benefit
Arrangements that is or would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any of Company

of ERISA, "multiemployer plan", within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA,
or "multiple employer plan", within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code

the single-employer plan, multiemployer plan or multiple employer plan of any
Company ERISA Affiliate. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has,
currently or at any time within the last six (6) years, sponsored, maintained,
contributed or been required to contribute to any "single employer plan",
"multiemployer plan", or "multiple employer plan", each as defined in this
paragraph.

 

(4) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company Benefit Arrangements have been timely made and all obligations in

or reflected on its most recent consolidated financial statements included in
the Company Financial Statements to the extent required by GAAP in
all material respects.

(5) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligations for post-employment or post-retirement
health, medical or life insurance benefits under any Company Benefit
Arrangement or collective bargaining agreement, except as required by COBRA.
Except as Previously Disclosed, the Company or its Subsidiaries have reserved
the right to amend or terminate any such Company Benefit Arrangement at any
time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of
claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

 



36 (6) Except as Previously Disclosed, there has been no amendment to,
announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Arrangements
that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Benefit
Arrangements above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most
recent fiscal year. Except as provided under the existing terms of the Company
Benefit Arrangements Previously Disclosed, and as Previously Disclosed,
neither the Companys execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated hereby,
either alone or in combination with another event, would reasonably be
expected to (A) limit or restrict the Companys right or, following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parents right to
administer, merge or amend in any respect or terminate any of the Company
Benefit Arrangements, (B) entitle any of the Companys employees or any
employees of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance
pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, or (C)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the Company Benefit Arrangements, except in the event such Company
Benefit Arrangement is terminated in accordance with Section 6.12.

(7) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide, and no Company Benefit Arrangement
or other agreement provides any individual with the right to, a gross up,
indemnification, reimbursement or other payment for any excise or additional
taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999
of the Code or due to the failure of any payment to be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code.

(8) Without limiting the foregoing, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including as a result of the termination of
the employment of any of its employees within a specified time of the
Effective Time), except as Previously Disclosed, no amounts paid or payable
(whether in cash, property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries will be an "excess parachute payment" to a "disqualified
individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code.

 

(9) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company,
each Company Benefit Arrangement that provides for nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code has been and is, in all
material respects, documented and operated in compliance with Section 409A of
the Code and all Company Stock Options were granted with an exercise price
per share no lower than fair market value (as defined in the applicable
Company Stock Plan) of one share of Company Common Stock on the date of the
corporate action effectuating the grant.

 

(u) _Property_.

 

(1) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company,
the Company has good, and, in the case of Owned Real Property, insurable,
title to or, in the case of securities and investments, a "security

Leased Real Property, a valid and 

 



37  enforceable leasehold interest in, all property (whether real or personal,
tangible or intangible, and including securities and investments) and assets
purported to be owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. With regard to Owned
Real Property, except as Previously Disclosed, the Company or Subsidiary is
not leasing or otherwise granting to any person the right to use or occupy

Knowledge, each of the other parties thereto, is not in material breach
of such Lease.

all Owned Real Property (including OREO) and Leased Real Property (together,

Knowledge, the counterparty or counterparties thereto, is enforceable in
accordance with the terms of such Contract (except as enforcement may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles) and is in full
force and effect. As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys Knowledge, any counterparty or

trustee, fiduciary, representative, agent (including a custodian, paying
agent or escrow agent), conservator, guardian or in a similar capacity
(collectively, " _Trust or Agency Agreements_ " and " _Trust or Agency
Accounts_ "), in accordance with the terms thereof and all applicable Law.
Since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A)
been subject to any claim for material damages, surcharged, disqualified or
removed from any capacity held under any Trust or Agency Agreement or (B)
been subject to any claim or received written notice questioning the validity
or enforceability of any Trust or Agency Agreement. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is eligible and qualified to act under each Trust or Agency
Agreement to which it is a party and is not prohibited by applicable Law from
performing its respective duties and obligations under any Trust or Agency
Agreement.

 

(2) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, nor
failed to take any action, which would, or with the giving of notice or the
passage of time or both could, (A) constitute a material default, breach or
violation, including a violation or breach of any fiduciary duty, under any
Trust or Agency Agreement, or (B) cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be subject to a claim for material damages, or to be
surcharged, disqualified or removed from any capacity held under any Trust or
Agency Agreement.

 

(3) Each Trust or Agency Agreement, and any amendment or modification thereto,
was duly executed and delivered (or accepted) by, and constitutes a legal,
valid agreement and binding appointment of, applicability to or obligation of,
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys Knowledge, each
other party or beneficiary thereto (as applicable), in accordance with the
term of those instruments.

or material violation of any duty by any other party with respect to any Trust
or Agency Accounts, including any agent or third party vendor employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries to perform or provide services for any one or more
Trust or Agency Account.

(5) To the Companys Knowledge, no event has occurred (including the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein) which would, or with the giving of notice or the passage
of time or both could, constitute a material default or material violation of

or Agency Agreement.

 



40 (6) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company,

connection with Trust or Agency Agreements (" _Trust or Agency Records_ ")
have been maintained in all material respects in accordance with the Companys
and its Subsidiaries customary practice, all applicable Law and the
applicable Trust or Agency Agreement. The Trust or Agency Records reflect all
dispositions and acquisitions of assets and receipt and disbursement of funds,
and the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be,
maintains a system of internal accounting controls, policies and procedures
sufficient to make it reasonable to expect that (A) such transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,
and (B) such transactions are recorded in all material respects in conformity
with any applicable accounting principles and in such a manner as to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with any applicable
accounting principles, including applicable trust principal and income rules,

all assets held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a Trust
or Agency Agreement are in the possession or control of the Company or one of
the Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries regularly perform an audit

Agency Agreements, and no such audit has indicated any material discrepancies.

of the Company and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with the requirements of
GAAP and are adequate thereunder.

 

(3) The Company has made available to Parent true and correct copies of the
Loan files related to each individual Loan, note, borrowing arrangement and

all other customers, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a single third party obligor, on the other hand, as of August

its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business and in
in material compliance with all applicable Law. All Interest Rate Instruments
are valid and legally binding obligations of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries and, to the Companys Knowledge, the counterparty or
counterparties thereto, are enforceable in accordance with their terms (except
as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles) and are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys Knowledge, any counterparty or

its Subsidiaries has been subject to over the past two (2) years in respect of
any Mortgage Loan, the circumstances as to each such matter, and the
resolution or status of each such matter.

 

(dd) _Reorganization_. The Company has not taken any action, and is not aware
of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to prevent or

is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (" _Pension Plan_ "), and that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination, opinion or
advisory letter, as applicable, from the IRS or has applied to the IRS for
such letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section
401(b) of the Code, and, to Parents Knowledge, there are no circumstances
reasonably likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Pension
Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. None of the Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate has incurred or would be reasonably
likely to incur any liability or obligation under Title IV of ERISA (other
than the timely payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation in the ordinary course of business) or a lien pursuant to Section
430(k) of the Code or Section 303(k) of ERISA. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, currently or at any time within the last six (6) years,
sponsored, maintained, contributed or been required to contribute to any
"single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
"multiemployer plan", within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, or
"multiple employer plan", within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.

 

(s) _Reorganization_. Parent has not taken any action, and is not aware of any
fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
the Merger and the Parent Merger, taken together, from being treated as a
single integrated transaction that qualifies for the Intended Tax Treatment.

 



50 (t) _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(1) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any other person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties.

(2) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other
person has made or is making any express or implied representation or
warranty other than those contained in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 6

 

COVENANTS

6.1  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, desirable or advisable
under applicable Law, so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the
Subsequent Mergers as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate
with, and furnish information to, the other party to that end. 

(b) The Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of any fact,
event or circumstance known to it that (1) is reasonably likely, individually
or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it,
to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) would cause
or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article 7\.

 

(c) Without limiting Section 6.1(b), from time to time on or prior to the
Closing Date, the Company or Parent may, after it becomes aware, supplement
any of its representations and warranties with respect to any fact, change,
event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein by delivering a supplemental
Disclosure Schedule (" _Supplemental Disclosure Schedule_ "). The information
contained in any such Supplemental Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
have modified any of the representations and warranties of the Company or
Parent contained in this Agreement or be considered Previously Disclosed
unless it is expressly accepted as such in writing by the other party.

6.2 _Stockholder Approvals_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration
Statement, filed pursuant to Section 6.5, shall have become effective (but in
any event within forty-five (45) days thereof), the Company Board will submit
to its shareholders the Company Shareholder Matters and any other matters
required to be approved or adopted by such shareholders in order to carry out
the intentions of this Agreement and the transactions

 



51  contemplated hereby. In furtherance of that obligation, the Company will
take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Constituent Documents, all
action necessary, proper, desirable or advisable to convene a meeting of its
shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement, the " _Company
Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable (but in any event within forty-five
(45) days of the Registration Statement becoming effective, or such other
date as mutually agreed to by the parties) to consider and vote upon approval
of the Company Shareholder Matters and any such other matters. The Company and
the Company Board, as applicable, will each use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from each class of the Companys shareholders the required vote to
approve the Company Shareholder Matters and any such other matters, including
soliciting proxies through the Joint Proxy Statement in accordance with
applicable Law and recommending that the Companys shareholders vote in favor
of the Company Shareholder Matters (and including such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement). The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon all proxy materials prior to the
distribution of such proxy materials to shareholders of the Company, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any comments of Parent and revise such
proxy materials as may be appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Company Board, after consultation with outside advisors including its outside
legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that continuing to recommend this Agreement and the
Company Shareholder Matters would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then, in submitting to its shareholders the Company
Shareholder Matters, the Company Board may withhold or withdraw or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation that Companys shareholders
approve this Agreement or submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board
may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders
in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto; provided that the Company Board may not take any actions under this
sentence until after giving Parent at least five (5) business days (or, if
fewer than five (5) business days remain prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, such fewer number of days) to respond to such Acquisition Proposal
or other event or circumstances giving rise to the determination by the
Company Board to take such action (and, in the event such action is taken in
response to an Acquisition Proposal, after giving Parent notice of the third
party in the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2 and will require a new notice period
as referred to in this Section 6.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be interpreted to excuse (1) the Company or the Company Board from complying
with its obligation to submit this Agreement and the other Company Shareholder
Matters to its shareholders at the Company Meeting or (2) any party to a
Company Voting Agreement from complying with its obligations thereunder.
Neither the Company nor the Company Board shall submit any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger to the vote of its shareholders unless this
Agreement shall have first been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration
Statement, filed pursuant to Section 6.5, shall have become effective (but in
any event within forty-five (45) days thereof), the Board of Directors of
Parent will submit to its stockholders the Parent Common Stock Issuance and
any other matters required to be approved or adopted by

 



52  such stockholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of that obligation,
Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Constituent
Documents, all action necessary, proper, desirable or advisable to convene a
meeting of its stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement, the "
_Parent Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable (but in any event within
forty-five (45) days of the Registration Statement becoming effective) to
consider and vote upon approval of the Parent Common Stock Issuance. Parent
and the Board of Directors of Parent, as applicable, will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain from Parents stockholders a vote approving the Parent
Common Stock Issuance, including soliciting proxies through the Joint Proxy
Statement in accordance with applicable Law and recommending that
Parents stockholders vote in favor of the Parent Common Stock Issuance (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement). Parent shall
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
all proxy materials prior to the distribution of such proxy materials to
stockholders of Parent.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Parent
Meeting and the Company Meeting on the same date. Each party shall cooperate
and keep the other party informed on a current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the
Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of each party.

6.3 _Regulatory Applications; Third-Party Consents_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to prepare as
promptly as practicable all documentation, to make all filings and to obtain
all consents, approvals, permits and other authorizations of all Governmental
Authorities necessary in order to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Subsequent Mergers, or those
the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material and adverse effect on Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), and to
make and obtain all other Required Third Party Consents; notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to prepare
and file, or cause their respective Subsidiaries to prepare and file, any
applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals within sixty (60) days of the date of this Agreement.
Each of the Company and Parent will have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other, in each case
subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to all material written information submitted to any third party or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals and the Required Third-Party Consents, other than any information
which is otherwise confidential. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
agrees that it will consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each party will keep the other party
appraised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



53 (b) The Company and Parent will, upon request (but subject to applicable
confidentiality requirements), furnish the other party with all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary, proper, desirable or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Affiliates with or to any third party
or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and to respond to any comment letters received in connection
therewith.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, nothing
shall require Parent or the Company to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to, take any
action or commit to take any action in connection with, or agree to any
condition on, or request with respect to, any Requisite Regulatory Approval
that would (i) materially and adversely affect the business, operations or
financial condition of Parent (measured on a scale relative to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii) require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any material and adverse covenants or commitments, or
complete any divestitures, whether prior to or subsequent to the Closing,
(iii) result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (iv) or restrict in any material and adverse respect or
impose a material burden on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or with respect to the business or
operation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective
Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (for purposes of clause (iv),
materiality shall be measured on a scale relative to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

6.4 _Exchange Listing_. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.

6.5 _SEC Filings_.

 

(a) Parent will prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other
applicable form (the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be filed by Parent with
the SEC in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(including the notice, proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy
solicitation materials of the Company and Parent constituting a part thereof
(the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and all related documents). The parties
agree to cooperate, and to cause their Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the
other party, its counsel and its accountants, in the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the filing of the Registration Statement with
the SEC within sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement. Parent
will use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing thereof and to maintain the effectiveness
(including by filing any necessary amendments or supplements) of such
Registration Statement until the Effective Time. Parent also agrees to use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company agrees to promptly furnish to Parent all

 



54  information concerning the Company, its Affiliates, officers, directors and
shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing,
in a form appropriate (or from which such information can be derived in a
commercially reasonable manner) for usage in such document or any such other
use.

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Affiliates, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. The Company and Parent each further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

 

(c) Parent shall promptly provide the Company with all comment letters from
the SEC or its Staff pertaining to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement relating to the Company. The Company will, upon request,
promptly furnish Parent with all information concerning itself, its
Affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may
be reasonably necessary, proper, desirable or advisable in order for Parent
to respond promptly to any comments received from the SEC. Parent will advise
the Company, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension
of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

 

6.6 _Press Releases_. Each party will consult with the other before issuing
any press release, employee communication or other shareholder communication
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such press
release or make any such communication without the prior written consent of
such other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other
party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances), issue such press release or make such communication as are
required by applicable Law or securities exchange rules. The Company and
Parent will cooperate to develop all public communications of the Company and
make appropriate members of management available at presentations related to
the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other
party.

 



55 6.7 _Acquisition Proposals_. The Company agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives, agents,
advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or knowingly encourage in any way
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential nonpublic information to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided
that, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions if the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such actions would be result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, further, that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
confidentiality provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (without
regard to any modification thereof pursuant hereto or lapse of time). The
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with
any persons other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce the confidentiality
provisions of any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly advise Parent following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent
apprised of any related developments on a prompt basis.

 

6.8 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. Neither the Company nor Parent will take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and will take or cause to
be taken all commercially reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated hereby from,
or if necessary challenge the applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law,
as now or hereafter in effect.

6.9 _Access; Information_. 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company agree that upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, such Party
will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other Party, and its
Representatives, such reasonable access during normal business hours
throughout the period before the Effective Time to the books, records
(including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties,
personnel and to such other information in its possession or control as the
other Party may reasonably request under the circumstances, including for
purposes of facilitating the integration of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with Parent and its Subsidiaries, and including as may be necessary or
advisable to effect the Conversion pursuant to Section 6.13. In addition, the
Company will furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (1) to the extent
consistent with applicable Law, a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state banking
or securities Laws, and (2) all other information in its possession or
control concerning the business, properties and personnel of it and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may

 



56  reasonably request. The Company shall also provide Parent with copies of
regular annual, quarterly and monthly financial reports that the Company or
Company Bank Sub prepare in the ordinary course of business, beginning with
the first full week after the date hereof until the Effective Time reasonably
promptly after they become available. The Company and Parent each agree to
promptly notify the other of any action, suit, claim, hearing, dispute,
subpoena, investigation or proceeding commenced, or to the Knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened against the Company or Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries that are related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will
require Parent or the Company to afford access or disclose information that
would violate applicable Law, jeopardize attorney-client privilege, or
contravene any binding agreement with any third party. The parties will make
appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous
sentence applies. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the regular business
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries during any such access.

(b) No investigation by the Company or Parent of, or Knowledge that the
Company or Parent may have with respect to, the business and affairs of the
other Party, pursuant to this Section 6.9 or otherwise, will affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of such Party in this Agreement, or the conditions to such Partys obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The Company shall give reasonable notice to Parent of all meetings of the
Company Board and any of its committees, and the board of directors of the
Company Bank Sub and any of its committees, and the agenda for or business to
be discussed at such meetings. To the extent permissible under applicable Law,
the Company shall promptly transmit to Parent copies of all notices, minutes,
consents and other materials that the Company or the Company Bank Sub provides
to their respective directors; _provided_ that the Company shall not be
required to disclose any information or documents related to, and may redact
any information or document to the extent it relates to, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any Acquisition Proposal, or any other
matter involving attorney-client privileged matters.

 

(d) The Company shall cause the Company Bank Sub, prior to the Closing Date,
(i) to write off all Loans of the Company Bank Sub that are required to be
written off by the Company Bank Subs regulators or that, in conformity with
past practices and policies of the Company Bank Sub and GAAP, should be
written off as Loan losses and (ii) to write down potential Loan losses
in conformity with past practices and policies of the Company Bank Sub and
GAAP. No such write-off or write-down shall result in a breach of any warranty
or representation made herein or otherwise have any effect on the
determination by the Parties that the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 7 have been satisfied, fulfilled or waived or have any effect on the
calculation of Company Tangible Common Equity. Nothing in this Section 6.9(d)
shall require the Company to make any additional provision to the Company Bank
Subs reserve for loan losses so long as such reserve is adequate and in
compliance with GAAP and all regulatory requirements.

 



57 (e) Notwithstanding Section 6.9(d), to the extent reasonably requested by
Parent, the Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause the Company Bank
Sub, to: (a) make any accounting adjustments or entries to its books of
account and other financial records; (b) make additional provisions to the
Company Bank Subs allowance for loan and lease losses; (c) sell or transfer
any investment securities held by it; (d) charge off any Loan; (e) create any
new reserve account or make additional provisions to any other existing
reserve account; (f) make changes in any accounting method; (g) accelerate,
defer or accrue any anticipated obligation, expense or income item; and (h)
make any other adjustments which would affect the financial reporting of
Parent, on a consolidated basis after the Effective Time; provided, however,
that neither the Company nor the Company Bank Sub shall be obligated to take
any such requested action until immediately prior to the Closing and at such
time as the Company shall have received reasonable assurances in writing that
all conditions precedent to Parents obligations under this Agreement (except
for the completion of actions to be taken at the Closing) have been satisfied
and, in any case, may be conditioned upon the subsequent occurrence of the
Closing, and no such adjustment which the Company or the Company Bank Sub
would not have been required to make but for the request by Parent pursuant to
the terms of this Section 6.9(e) shall result in a breach of any warranty or
representation made herein or otherwise have any effect on the determination
by the Parties that the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7 have
been satisfied, fulfilled or waived or have any impact on the calculation of
Company Tangible Common Equity.

(f) Each of Parent and the Company will hold any information it may obtain
from the other in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby which is nonpublic and confidential to the extent required
by, and in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.10 _Supplemental Indentures_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
by or on behalf of Parent and the Company, one or more supplemental indentures
and other instruments, and take or cause to be taken all such other action,
required for the due assumption of the Companys outstanding debt,
Trust Preferred Securities, guarantees, securities, and (to the extent
Previously Disclosed by the Company) other agreements to the extent required
by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities or other agreements.

 

6.11 _Indemnification_.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall purchase, and Parent shall maintain for the duration of the Tail
Coverage Period, a tail policy of directors and officers liability coverage
that provides directors and officers liability insurance with respect to
actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the following conditions:

 

(1) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase, at its own
expense, for the benefit of the Company and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries (including their respective successors) and
persons who were officers or directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date, a prepaid tail policy or policies from
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurer providing
coverages no less favorable to the insured persons than the level and scope of
directors and officers liability as set forth in the Companys and its
Subsidiaries current directors and officers liability insurance policies in
effect as of the Closing (together, such tail policy or policies are referred
to as the " _Tail Policy_ ").

 



58 (2) The term of the Tail Policy shall be for a period of six (6) years or, if
such term of coverage is not available, such other maximum period of coverage
available at a cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount (as defined below) (the "
_Tail Coverage Period_ ").

 

(3) In the event such insurer declines to provide the Tail Policy prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
identify and obtain similar coverage from another insurance carrier of
substantially similar size and reputation to that of such former insurer, if
such coverage is reasonably obtainable from the marketplace. If after such
reasonable efforts another such insurance carrier is unable or unwilling to
provide such similar coverage, the Company shall obtain the best coverage
available, as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Company, for a cost
up to but not exceeding the Maximum Amount (as defined below).

(4) In no event shall the Company expend, in order to provide or maintain the
insurance coverages pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), any annual amount, in
aggregate, in excess of the amount set forth on Disclosure Schedule 6.11(a)
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for a total
cost equal to the Maximum Amount.

(5) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify the appropriate
directors and officers liability insurers of the Merger and of all pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims, actions, suits,
proceedings or investigations asserted or claimed against any officer or
director of the Company or the Company Bank Sub, or circumstances to the
Knowledge of the Company reasonably likely to give rise thereto to the extent
known by the Company or the Company Bank Sub, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable policies. The Companys and the Company Bank
Subs directors and officers shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Company (if prior to the Closing Date) or Parent (if after the Effective
Time) in obtaining the above-described insurance coverages.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director or officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any other Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
Constituent Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, in
such capacities) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties"_ ), and
any person who becomes a Company Indemnified Party between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or the
Company Bank Sub and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including the transactions

 



59  contemplated by this Agreement, to the same extent as such persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to their respective Constituent Documents in effect on
the date of this Agreement; and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred
by such Company Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are
entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to their respective Constituent Documents
in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(c) Nothing set forth in this Section 6.11 is intended to or shall limit or
otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable, by each of the Company Indemnified Parties, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives. In the event that, after the Effective
Time, Parent (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any
person, then, and in each case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made
so that such successors and assigns shall expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.11.

6.12 _Benefits Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each
individual who is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Covered Employees_ "), base compensation,
bonus opportunities and employee benefits that are consistent with
the compensation, bonus opportunities and employee benefits that Parent
offers to its similarly situated employees. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor all of the Company Benefit Arrangements, it being
understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a
"change in control" (or equivalent term) for purposes of such Company Benefit
Arrangements.

 

(b) _Termination of Company 401(k) Plan._

 

(1) If requested in writing by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions of its board of
directors to terminate the Companys 401(k) Savings Plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_ ") effective immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time and to fully vest all participants in such
Company 401(k) Plan. Before adopting such resolutions, the Company shall
provide a draft of such resolutions to Parent for an opportunity to comment
thereon, which Parent shall not unreasonably delay.

 



60 (2) Prior to the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall make contributions to the Company 401(k) Plan with
respect to the plan year commencing January 1, 2017 (and if applicable any
subsequent plan year commencing prior to the Effective Time) and ending on the
date of the Company 401(k) Plan termination in accordance with the terms of
the Company 401(k) Plan.

(3) As of the later of the Effective Time and the date on which the Company
401(k) Plan is terminated, Parent shall offer participation in Parents tax-
qualified defined contribution plan (" _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to each person
who was an active participant in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date of
its termination. Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to, following the
Closing Date and pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code, accept
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of eligible amounts (including
outstanding loans) distributed to employees from the Company 401(k) Plan.

 

(c) _Severance Benefits_. Following the Effective Time and for eighteen months
thereafter, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall cause the Covered Employees who
are employed as of the Effective Time to be covered by the Companys
Previously Disclosed Severance Pay Benefit Policy, based on such Covered
Employees compensation and benefits as of immediately prior to the date
of termination (or, if greater, based on such Covered Employees compensation
and benefits with the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time). In
connection with the foregoing, such terminated Covered Employees shall receive
service credit for years of continuous service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining the
amount of any severance pay under such plan, program or policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Covered Employee eligible to receive
severance benefits under an employment agreement, change in control agreement,
retention agreement or similar agreement shall be entitled to participate in
the severance plan, program or policy described in this Section 6.12(c).

(d) _Service Credit_. For all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the Parent Benefit
Arrangements, each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Covered
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Arrangement in which such Covered Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or Parent Bank Sub. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Parent Benefit Arrangements to the extent
coverage under such Parent Benefit Arrangements is replacing a comparable
Company Benefit Arrangement in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) with respect to welfare
benefit plans of Parent or Parent Bank Sub in which Covered Employees are
eligible to participate, Parent agrees to cause each such welfare
benefit plan to waive any preexisting conditions, waiting periods and
actively at work requirements under such plans. In no event shall such
recognition of service operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee
with respect to the same period of service. For purposes of each Parent
Benefit Arrangement providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits, Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by Covered
Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of
the

 



61  comparable Company Benefit Arrangement ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding Parent plan begins to be taken into account
under such Parent Benefit Arrangement for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his covered dependents for the applicable plan year of the
Parent plan.

(e) _Retention Programs._ Following the date hereof, Parent may, in its sole
discretion, establish a cash-based award program to promote the retention
between the date hereof and the Effective Time of Covered Employees, with such
terms and conditions, including the Covered Employees who will participate in
the programs, as determined by Parent. 

(f) _No Third Party Rights_. This Section 6.12 shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Section 6.12. To the extent permitted by applicable legal requirements, prior
to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the appropriate committee thereof,
as applicable, shall adopt such amendments to the Company Benefit Arrangements
as may be mutually agreed between the Company and Parent; provided, however,
that any such amendment shall not be effective until immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall be contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (1) alter
or limit the ability of Parent or its Subsidiaries to amend, modify, change
or terminate any Benefit Arrangement or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, (2) confer upon any
current or former employee or other service provider of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, any right to employment or continued employment or continued
service with Parent or of its Subsidiaries, or constitute or create an
employment or agreement with, or modify the at-will status of any, employee
or other service provider, (3) permit any payment to be made to an employee or
service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries that requires prior
approval or non-objection from a Governmental Authority without obtaining such
prior approval or non-objection or (4) alter or limit the ability of Parent or
its Subsidiaries to exercise discretion with respect to eligibility,
participation, amounts awarded or payable, or benefits provided, under the
terms or provisions of any Benefit Arrangement of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

6.13 _Conversion, Data Processing and Related Matters_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the parties agree to cooperate and to employ their commercially
reasonable efforts to plan, execute and complete, at Parents sole cost, the
Conversion in an orderly and efficient manner following the Closing; provided,
that in no event shall the Conversion become effective prior to the Effective
Time. Commencing as of the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent
shall each appoint qualified staff members to act as project managers for the
Conversion (each, a " _Conversion Project Manager_ "). Such
Conversion Project Managers shall act as the principal contacts between the
parties on matters relating to the Conversion, and shall coordinate the
assignment of personnel as required and generally facilitate the planning,
execution and completion of the Conversion. In addition to any conversion of
the data and systems files as part of the Conversion, the parties shall
reasonably cooperate in exchanging and providing the information requested and
performing such tasks as may be necessary to complete the Conversion,
including the collection and input of relevant data, development of new
operating procedures and design of forms, in each case, as mutually agreed by
the parties. Subject to

 



62  applicable Law, the Company shall, commencing as of the date of this
Agreement, provide Parent and Parent Bank Sub with reasonable access to the
Company Bank Subs offices, systems and facilities and all relevant
information and personnel at such times and places as Parent Bank Sub shall
reasonably request (with minimal disruption to the Companys and Company Bank
Subs employees, customers and operations) as shall be reasonably necessary
to effect the Conversion following the Closing. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of Parent and Company shall exercise, consistent with, and subject
to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.14 _Title Surveys_.

(a) The Company shall order, at Companys sole cost and expense, within ten
(10) business days after the date of this Agreement, with respect to all Owned

any Subsidiary thereof as of the date hereof, (1) an ALTA survey made in
accordance with the 2017 minimum standard detail requirements for ALTA/NSPS

and repute (the " _Title Company_ "), (2) a commitment for issuance of an
ALTA 2006 Owners Policy of Title Insurance or a similar insurance policy
(each a " _Title Commitment_ ") dated subsequent to the date of this

amount equal to the greater of the value of such real property as shown on the
Companys or its Subsidiaries books and records or the fair market value of
such real property and (3) copies of all documents referenced in the Title
Commitment exceptions. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause (x) the delivery to Parent of a Survey and (y) the Title Company to
deliver to Parent a Title Commitment and copies of all documents referenced
in the Title Commitment exceptions for each real property owned by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than OREO) as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement.

(b) For each real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent will have a period of ten (10) business days from Parents receipt of
the last of the Survey, the Title Commitment and all documents referenced in
the Title Commitment exceptions with respect to such real property (" _Title
Review Period_ ") in which to review such documents and provide the Company
with written notice (" _Title Notice_ ") of any condition disclosed in such
Survey or Title Commitment that is not reasonably approved by Parent;
provided, however, Parent shall be deemed to approve any condition that is a
Permitted Lien.

(c) If a Title Notice is timely given by Parent, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (but in any event within twenty-
five (25) days of the date of the Title Notice) cure or remove, to Parents
reasonable satisfaction, each condition set forth on the Title Notice.

 



63 (d) The Company shall cause the Title Company to deliver title insurance
policies to match the Title Commitments on or prior to the Closing Date as

sole expense and with minimal interference with the regular business
operations conducted at the applicable Real Property, a Phase I environmental

indicated in the Environmental Survey (the " _Phase_ __ _ II Survey_"). The
subject, scope, manner and method of the Phase II Survey will be subject to
the Companys prior review and reasonable approval, which approval shall not
be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. At all times the Company
shall have access to all field data, analytical data and analytical results
obtained or generated in connection with the Phase II Survey. Upon Parents
receipt of a final written report of the Phase II Survey, at the Companys

any litigation against the Company and or its directors or Affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company
shall not agree to any such settlement without Parents prior written consent

then current officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such reasonably
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other party, at the
expense of the party who makes any such request.

not adversely affect the federal income Tax consequences to the shareholders
of the Company as compared to those resulting from the Intended Tax Treatment,

revision does not otherwise cause, and could not reasonably be expected to
cause, any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 not to be capable of

thereof). This Agreement and any related documents will be appropriately
amended in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof in order to reflect
any such revised structure or method.

OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

written agreements previously made or purported to be made. Except for
Section 6.11, which is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties to the
extent stated, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any person other
than the Company and Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto
hereby agree that the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not
result in the termination of the Confidentiality Agreement, which remains in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.

 

9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
and may be delivered by means of facsimile or email (or any other electronic
means such as ".pdf" or ".tiff" files), each of which shall be deemed to

be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (a) all other
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transaction
contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any
party and (b) the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby can be consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

 

9.11 _Subsidiary and Affiliate Action_. Wherever a party has an obligation
under this Agreement to "cause" a Subsidiary or Affiliate of such party or
any such Subsidiarys or Affiliates officers, directors, management or
employees to take, or refrain from taking, any action, or such action that may
be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, such obligation of
such party shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of such party
to cause such Subsidiary or Affiliate to take such necessary action. Wherever
this Agreement provides that a Subsidiary or Affiliate of a party has
an obligation to act or refrain from taking any action, such party shall be
deemed to have an obligation under this Agreement to cause such Subsidiary or
Affiliate, or any such Subsidiarys or Affiliates officers, directors,
management or employees, to take, or refrain from taking, any action, or such
action as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. To
the extent necessary or appropriate to give meaning or effect to the
provisions of this Agreement or to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have an
obligation under this Agreement to cause any Subsidiary thereof to take, or
refrain from taking, any action, and to cause such Subsidiarys officers,
directors, management or employees, to take, or refrain from taking, any
action otherwise contemplated herein. Any failure by an Affiliate of Parent or
the Company to act or refrain from taking any action contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent or the
Company, respectively.

 



74 9.12 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

9.13 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
