("Agreement"), dated as of this 10/th/ day of June, 2001, is made among
Material Sciences Corporation ("MSC"), a Delaware corporation, with its
principal office at 2200 East Pratt Boulevard, Elk Grove Village, IL
60007, MSC Specialty Films, Inc. ("MSC/SFI"), a California corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of MSC, with its principal office at 4540 Viewridge
Avenue, San Diego, CA 92123 (MSC and MSC/SFI, collectively, herein the "MSC
Parties"), and Bekaert Corporation ("Bekaert"), a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of N.V. Bekaert S.A., with its principal office at
3200 West Market Street, Suite 303, Akron, OH 44333, and N.V. Bekaert S.A.
("NVB"), a Belgian corporation, with its principal office at Bekaertstraat 2,
B-8550, Zwevegem, Belgium (Bekaert and NVB, collectively, herein the "Bekaert
Parties").   RECITALS:   A. MSC/SFI (directly or through its subsidiaries)
is in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and
selling coated flexible substrates and films for both industrial and window
film applications and has substantial and valuable experience in such
business (as conducted by MSC/SFI and its subsidiaries, herein the
"Business").   B. MSC/SFI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MSC.   C.
Bekaert, through its Affiliates, is in the business, among other activities,
of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling specialized sputtered
thin films on flexible substrates and has substantial and valuable experience
in such business.   D. Bekaert is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NVB.   E.
MSC/SFI and Bekaert formed Innovative Specialty Films, LLC ("ISF"),
a Delaware limited liability company, as a joint venture entity whose
initial purpose was to establish, own and operate development and production
facilities in the United States of America and Belgium to develop and
manufacture sputter coated films and to market and sell them to a variety of

subsidiaries, Pro Marketing, Inc., a Nebraska corporation ("Pro Marketing"),
and Solar-Gard International, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Solar- Gard"),
will be merged with and into MSC/SFI. MSC/SFI will be the surviving entity.
As a result of the Solar-Gard merger, MSC/SFI will own all of the equity in
MSC Specialty Films (UK) Ltd., a United Kingdom corporation, Solar Gard  
2   (SEA) Pte, Ltd., a Singapore corporation, and MSC Specialty Films
(Canada) Inc., an Ontario corporation.   H. Prior to the Closing of this
transaction, MSC/SFI will form a wholly owned Delaware limited liability
company ("Newco"). MSC/SFI will contribute the Business through the
contribution of substantially all of its assets (including the assets that
were formerly owned by Pro Marketing and Solar-Gard) to Newco in accordance
with that certain Contribution Agreement, between the MSC Parties and Newco
(the "Contribution Agreement"), in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 7.2.14.   I. Upon forming Newco, MSC/SFI will transfer to Newco the
stock of three (3) of its wholly owned subsidiaries, MSC Specialty Films
(Australasia) Pty. Limited, an Australian corporation, MSC Specialty Films de
Mexico S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation, and Specialty Films de Services
Company S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation, except that 1% of the stock of
each of MSC Specialty Films de Mexico S.A. de C.V. and Specialty Films de
Services Company S.A. de C.V. (the "Mexican Subsidiaries") will be
transferred to another Foreign Subsidiary.   J. MSC/SFI desires to sell to
Bekaert all of MSC/SFI\'s right, title and interest in and to its membership
interest in ISF (the "ISF Membership Interest") and in and to its membership
interest in Newco (the "Newco Membership Interest"), in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   K. MSC/SFI desires to
sell to NVB, or its designated Affiliate, all of MSC/SFI\'s right, title and
interest in and to the Intellectual Property and MSC desires to sell to NVB,
or its designated Affiliate, all of MSC\'s right, title and interest in and
to a certain agreement with Research Frontiers Incorporated, and NVB, or its
designated Affiliate, desires to purchase such intellectual property, in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises hereinafter set forth,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the mutual receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as
follows:  1. SALE AND PURCHASE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN ISF AND NEWCO. 
----------------------------------------------------------   1.1 Sale,
Assignment and Transfer. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
----------------------------- this Agreement, at the Closing, MSC/SFI shall
sell, assign and transfer to Bekaert all of MSC/SFI\'s right, title and
interest in and to the ISF Membership Interest and the Newco Membership
Interest, and Bekaert shall purchase the ISF Membership Interest and the
Newco Membership Interest from MSC/SFI.   1.2 Purchase Price. Subject to the
adjustments hereinafter provided in  -------------- Section 1.4,  
3   the purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the ISF Membership
Interest, the Newco Membership Interest and the NVB Intellectual Property
Rights shall be an amount equal to One Hundred Twenty-Two Million, One
Hundred Thirty-Seven Thousand, One Hundred Ninety-Five US Dollars (US
$122,137,195).   1.3 Payment of Purchase Price. At the Closing, Bekaert
and/or NVB shall  ------------------------- pay MSC/SFI the Purchase Price
via wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
MSC/SFI.   1.4 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments. 
---------------------------------------   1.4.1 Closing Trial Balance
Procedure. Within thirty (30) days 
------------------------------- following the Closing Date, Bekaert shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to MSC/SFI a consolidated closing trial
balance for the Companies (the "Preliminary Closing Trial Balance"), together
with copies of all workpapers, notes and other information relating to the
preparation thereof. The Preliminary Closing Trial Balance shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the February 28, 2001
audited financial statements except for Bekaert-approved changes in
accounting for ISF on a two month lag; shall be based on physical inventories
taken as of the Closing Date; and shall be in the form set forth as an
example in Schedule 1.4.1. During the thirty (30) day period
following MSC/SFI\'s receipt of the Preliminary Closing Trial Balance,
Bekaert shall cooperate, in good faith, with MSC/SFI in connection with
MSC/SFI\'s review and analysis of the Preliminary Closing Trial Balance.
Within such thirty (30) day period, MSC/SFI shall inform Bekaert in writing
of any objections it may have with respect to the Preliminary Closing Trial
Balance. The Preliminary Closing Trial Balance shall be deemed accepted by
MSC/SFI if no objections are received by Bekaert during such thirty (30) day
period and shall become the Final Closing Trial Balance. If MSC/SFI provides
Bekaert with objections to the Preliminary Closing Trial Balance, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes relating thereto. If
the disputes cannot be resolved between the parties within thirty (30) days
following MSC/SFI\'s notice, all issues in dispute shall be submitted to a
mutually acceptable accounting firm, and such accounting firm\'s
determination as to the issues in dispute shall be final and binding on all
the parties. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be paid
equally by MSC/SFI and Bekaert. The Preliminary Closing Trial Balance, after
all adjustments pursuant to the foregoing procedures, shall be considered the
"Final Closing Trial Balance."   1.4.2 Working Capital Adjustment. The
parties acknowledge that the  -------------------------- Purchase Price
assumes that the Consolidated Closing Purchased Working Capital outlined as
on Schedule 1.4.2 shall be Fifteen Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand US
Dollars (US $15,250,000) (the "Target Working Capital"). Accordingly, if the
Consolidated Closing Purchased Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing
Trial Balance, is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price
shall be increased, dollar for dollar, by the amount that the Consolidated
Closing Purchased Working Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital. If, on
the other hand,   4   the Consolidated Closing Purchased Working Capital
reflected on the Final Closing Trial Balance is less than the Target Working
Capital, the Purchase Price shall be decreased, dollar for dollar, by the
amount that the Consolidated Closing Purchased Working Capital is less than
such amount. The calculation for the working capital adjustment shall be in
the form set forth as an example in Schedule 1.4.2. The foregoing adjustment
shall be coordinated and netted with the other Purchase Price adjustments
provided for in this Section 1.4 as set forth in Section 1.4.7.   1.4.3
Foreign Subsidiaries Cash-on-Hand Adjustment. The parties 
-------------------------------------------- acknowledge that the Purchase
Price assumes that the aggregate cash-on-hand and cash equivalents of the
Foreign Subsidiaries on the Closing Date shall be Three Hundred Thousand US
Dollars (US $300,000) (the "Target Foreign Cash Amount"). Accordingly, if the
aggregate cash on hand and cash equivalents of the Foreign Subsidiaries
reflected on the Final Closing Trial Balance is greater than the Target
Foreign Cash Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased, dollar
for dollar, by the amount that the Target Foreign Cash Amount exceeds such
amount. If, on the other hand, the Target Foreign Cash Amount is less than
the aggregate amounts reflected on the Final Closing Trial Balance, the
Purchase Price shall be decreased, dollar for dollar, by the amount that the
Target Foreign Cash Amount is less than such aggregate amounts. The
calculation for the Foreign Subsidiaries\' cash-on-hand adjustment shall be
in the form set forth as an example in Schedule 1.4.3. The foregoing
adjustment shall be coordinated and netted with the other Purchase Price
adjustments provided for in this Section 1.4 as set forth in Section
1.4.7.   1.4.4 EVA Plan Adjustment. The parties acknowledge that the
Purchase  ------------------- Price assumes that the estimated aggregate
June 29, 2001 amount of the bonuses related to the EVA Plan is Four Hundred
and Fifty-Six Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty-Six US Dollars (US $456,786)
excluding the "banked" portion of the amount assumed to be accrued under the
EVA Plan as of June 29, 2001 (the "Preliminary EVA Plan Accrual"). Within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Bekaert shall prepare and deliver to
MSC/SFI a calculation of a revised EVA Plan accrual (the "Adjusted EVA Plan
Accrual") determined by adjusting the Preliminary EVA Plan Accrual to account
for (i) employee hirings, terminations and changes in compensation from May
25, 2001 to the Closing Date; and (ii) the actual EVA performance of MSC/SFI
through the Closing Date. The Purchase Price assumes an estimated EVA bank
balance on a discounted basis of Five Hundred Seventy-Four Thousand Five
Hundred Fifty-Nine US Dollars (US $574,559). The estimated EVA bank
achievement (Eighty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Seventy-One US Dollars
(US $89,471)) shall be adjusted to account for increases or decreases in
the discounted achievement at June 29, 2001. The adjustment to the Purchase
Price made pursuant to this Section 1.4.4 (the "Total EVA Plan Adjustment")
shall be in the form set forth as an example in Schedule 1.4.4. If the Total
EVA Plan Adjustment is a positive amount, the Purchase Price shall be
increased, dollar for dollar by the Total EVA Plan Adjustment. If the Total
EVA Plan Adjustment is a negative amount, the Purchase Price shall be
decreased dollar for dollar by the Total EVA Plan Adjustment. The foregoing
adjustment shall be coordinated and netted with the other Purchase Price
adjustments provided for in this Section 1.4 as set forth in Section
1.4.7.   5    1.4.5 SERP Adjustment. The Purchase Price will be adjusted
in  --------------- accordance with Section 8.3.6. The Total SERP Adjustment
shall be in the form set forth on Schedule 1.4.5. The foregoing adjustment
shall be coordinated and netted with the other Purchase Price adjustments
provided for in this Section 1.4 as set forth in Section 1.4.7.   1.4.6
Certain Foreign Subsidiary Intercompany Accounts Adjustment. 
----------------------------------------------------------- An adjustment
will be made to the Purchase Price for the intercompany accounts of the
Foreign Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 1.4.6 as of the Closing Date. Within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Bekaert and the MSC Parties shall
determine the balance of the intercompany accounts of the
Foreign Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 1.4.6 (the "Foreign Subsidiary
Intercompany Account Balance") as of the Closing Date. If the Foreign
Subsidiary Intercompany Account Balance is positive, the Purchase Price will
be increased, dollar for dollar, by the positive amount. If the Foreign
Subsidiary Intercompany Account Balance is negative, the purchase price will
be decreased, dollar for dollar, by the negative amount. The foregoing
adjustment shall be coordinated and netted with the other Purchase Price
adjustments provided for in this Section 1.4 as set forth in Section 1.4.7.
The corresponding assets or liabilities (which remain with the Foreign
Subsidiaries by virtue of the transfer of stock as set forth in Section 2.5
of the Contribution Agreement) which are recorded on the accounting ledgers
of the applicable Foreign Subsidiary will be settled (collected if an asset
or paid if a liability) on the same day as the adjusting payment is made in
accordance with Section 1.4.7.   1.4.7 Coordination and Payment of Adjusting
Amount. The adjustments  -------------------------------------------- to the
Purchase Price provided for in this Section 1.4 shall be netted together to
arrive at a single overall purchase price adjustment consistent with
the formula for this calculation as set forth in Schedule 1.4.7 (Post
Closing Adjustment Summary). The party required to make the adjusting payment
to the other party shall make such payment within ten (10) days of the
determination of the Final Closing Trial Balance.   1.5 Allocation of
Purchase Price. For purposes of Section 1060 of the Tax 
---------------------------- Code, the Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the underlying assets of Newco, the underlying assets of ISF and the
NVB Intellectual Property Rights as determined by Bekaert and MSC; provided,
however, that the allocation for property, plant and equipment of Newco will
be Twenty Million US Dollars (US $20,000,000) and the allocation for NVB
Intellectual Property Rights will be the appraised value of such NVB
Intellectual Property Rights as determined by the independent appraiser
engaged by NVB. The parties agree to be bound by such allocation and to
complete and attach Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 to their respective
tax returns accordingly.   1.6 Business Day. If a date of a payment to be
made under this Article 1  ------------- is not a Business Day, the payment
shall be made on the next Business Day, but shall be deemed to have been made
on the date called for in this Agreement.   6    1.7 Conveyance of Title.
The conveyance of title to the ISF Membership  -------------------- Interest
and the Newco Membership Interest shall be effected by the execution and
delivery of such instruments of transfer and assignments as shall be
deemed reasonably required to effectively transfer and assign to, and vest

11   shareowner\'s equity and comprehensive income for the year ending
February 28, 2001, audited by Arthur Andersen LLP;   (2) The balance sheet
of MSC Specialty Films (Canada) Inc. as at February 28, 2001, and statements

Companies as of February 28, 2001 (the "Acquisition Balance Sheets"), and
related income statement for the twelve (12) month period then ended prepared

the MSC/SFI Entities\' books of account in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, are accurate and complete, and present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the MSC/SFI Entities at the
dates and for the periods indicated, except for the absence of footnote
disclosure and customary year-end audit adjustments of a normal recurring
type which would not be material in the aggregate in the Acquisition Balance
Sheets and related income statements. The books of account of the MSC/SFI
Entities accurately reflect all items of income and expense (including, but
not limited to, accruals) and all assets and liabilities of the MSC/SFI
Entities in accordance with normal accrual accounting practices, subject to
customary year-end and audit adjustments of a normal, recurring type which

other than Liabilities incurred, and obligations entered into, in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.   3.3.3 No
Changes. Since February 28, 2001, each MSC/SFI Entity has  ---------- been
operated only in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice,
except for the contribution of the Contributed Assets to Newco in accordance
with the Contribution Agreement. Since that date, there has not been any
adverse change, or event or circumstance which might reasonably be expected
to result in an adverse change, in any MSC/SFI Entities\' assets,
liabilities, operating performance, business relationships or prospects.

disposition of any assets other than inventory in the   13   ordinary
course of business;   (i) payment or increase by an MSC/SFI Entity of any

course consistent with past practice), any employment, severance or similar
agreement with any employee;   (j) adopt or change or increase in the
payments to or benefits under any Employee Program; or   (k) unusual or
novel method of transacting business engaged in by an MSC/SFI Entity or any

additions to tax, interest, fines and penalties owed by it (collectively,
"Taxes"), owed or required to be paid by it through the date hereof whether
disputed or not. Each MSC/SFI Entity has in accordance with applicable law
filed all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns required to be filed
by it through the date hereof, and all such returns correctly and accurately
set forth the amount of any Taxes relating to the applicable period.   (b)
Except as set forth in Section 3.3.4 of the Disclosure Letter, within the
past seven (7) years from the date of this Agreement, there has not been any
audit of any tax return filed by an MSC/SFI Entity , no such audit is in
progress, and no MSC/SFI Entity has been notified by any Taxing
Authority that any such audit is contemplated or pending. No extension of
time with respect to any date on which a tax return was or is to be filed by
an MSC/SFI Entity is in force, and no waiver or agreement by an MSC/SFI
Entity is in force for the extension of time for the assessment or payment of
any Taxes.   (c) There is no claim with respect to any MSC/SFI Entity for
any Taxes, and no assessment, deficiency or adjustment has been asserted or
proposed with respect to any return of or with respect to any MSC/SFI
Entity.   (d) Section 3.3.4 of the Disclosure Letter contains a true
and complete copy of each written tax allocation or sharing agreement and a
true and complete description of each   14   unwritten tax allocation or
sharing arrangement affecting an MSC/SFI Entity. All such agreements shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date, and no payments are due or will become
due on or after the Closing Date pursuant to any such agreement or
arrangement.   (e) To the Knowledge of the MSC Parties, no Foreign
Subsidiaries will be required to include any amount in income for any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date as a result of a change in accounting
method for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or
pursuant to any agreement with any Taxing Authority with respect to any such
taxable period.   (f) No liens (whether filed or arising by operation of
law) have been imposed upon or asserted against an MSC/SFI Entity as a result
of or in connection with the failure or alleged failure to pay any Taxes.  
(g) Except as provided under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), no MSC/SFI Entity has any
Liabilities for the Taxes of any Person as a transferee or successor, or
by contract or otherwise.   (h) No amount that could be received (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer or
director of an MSC/SFI Entity who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or plan currently in effect would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code) or would be non-deductible by reason of Code Section 162(m).   (i) No
MSC/SFI Entity owns or has owned, within the past ten (10) years from the
date hereof, a direct or indirect interest in any trust, partnership,
corporation or other entity, other than MSC/SFI\'s ownership of
the Companies.   3.4 Legal.  -----   3.4.1 Compliance with Laws.

MSC Parties, there have been no allegations of or inquiries concerning any
violations of Law by an MSC/SFI Entity within the past three (3) years; (ii)
no permits, registrations, licenses, franchises, certifications, registries,
approvals or authorizations ("Approvals") of any Governmental Authority are

full force and effect, and the MSC/SFI Entities are operating in compliance
therewith; (iv) all requests for renewals of the Approvals have been timely
filed; (v) no proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the MSC Parties,
is threatened to revoke or limit any of them or otherwise impose any

form the basis for any revocation or limitation of them or other imposition
of conditions or obligations on the possession or transfer of any of them;
(vii) in the past three (3) years, there have been no claims, notices, orders
or directives issued by any Governmental Authority with respect to an MSC/SFI
Entity\'s business. No MSC/SFI Entity is required to make, and has
no reasonable expectation that any MSC/SFI Entity will be required to make,
in order to operate the Business, any expenditures to achieve or
maintain compliance with any Law, except as set forth in Section 3.4.1 of the
Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 3.8, and not this
Section 3.4.1, shall apply with respect to any Environmental Matters, except

----------------- Disclosure Letter, no product liability or other tort
claims have been made or threatened against an MSC/SFI Entity relating to
products sold or services performed by an MSC/SFI Entity in the past five (5)
years. To the Knowledge of the MSC Parties, there are no defects in the
design or manufacture of products manufactured or sold by an MSC/SFI Entity,
or any failure by an MSC/SFI Entity to warn, test, inspect or instruct of
dangers which could form the basis for a product recall (whether or not at
the request of a Governmental Authority) or a cause of action for product
liability (including, without limitation, failure to warn, test, inspect or
instruct) against an MSC/SFI Entity, nor is there any reason to know of any
such defect or failure. MSC/SFI has given Bekaert copies of all the product
liability insurance policies purchased by the MSC/SFI Entities in the past
five (5) years.   3.4.4 Litigation. Except as listed in Section 3.4.4 of
the  ---------- Disclosure Letter:   (a) no claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding:   (i) is pending and has been served or, to the
Knowledge of the MSC Parties, is threatened against an MSC/SFI Entity; or  
(ii) involving an MSC/SFI Entity has been concluded in the past three (3)

Section 3.5.1 of the Disclosure  ------------------------ Letter sets forth
the total number of full-time employees and part-time employees for each
MSC/SFI Entity   17   as of May 31, 2001. No MSC/SFI Entity is delinquent
in payment to any of their employees for any wages, salaries, commissions,
bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed for them to
the date hereof or amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees. Upon
termination of the employment of any of said employees, no MSC/SFI Entity
will by reason of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, the
Contribution Agreement or anything done prior to the Closing, be liable to
any of said employees for so-called "severance pay" or any other payments.
Except as listed in Section 3.5.1 of the Disclosure Letter, the MSC/SFI
Entities do not have any formal policy, practice, plan or program of paying
severance pay or any form of severance compensation in connection with the
termination of employment. The MSC/SFI Entities are in compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations respecting labor, employment, fair employment
practices, work place safety and health, terms and conditions of employment,
and wages and hours. There are no charges of employment discrimination or
unfair labor practices, nor are there any strikes, slowdowns, stoppages of
work, or any other concerted interference with normal operations which are
existing, pending or threatened against or involving any MSC/SFI Entity.
There are no grievances, complaints or charges that have been filed against
an MSC/SFI Entity under any dispute resolution procedure (including, but not
limited to, any proceedings under any dispute resolution procedure under any
collective bargaining agreement) that might have an adverse effect on an
MSC/SFI Entity or the conduct of their business, and there is no arbitration
or similar proceeding pending and no claim therefor has been asserted. No
collective bargaining agreement is in effect or is currently being or is
about to be negotiated by an MSC/SFI Entity. None of the MSC/SFI Entities has
received any information indicating that any of its employment policies
or practices is currently being audited or investigated by any foreign,
federal, state or local government agency. As of the Closing Date, there were
no existing claims (whether asserted or unasserted) against an MSC/SFI Entity
for, and the MSC/SFI Entities have no liabilities in connection with, any
worker\'s compensation claims and/or COBRA claims or benefits, except as set
forth in Section 3.5.1 of the Disclosure Letter.   3.5.2 Contracts. Section
3.5.2 of the Disclosure Letter sets  --------- forth the following material
agreements (whether written or oral) with respect to the MSC/SFI Entities and
to which any MSC/SFI Entity is a party or bound (collectively, herein, the
"Material Contracts"):   (a) all contracts or agreements involving amounts

Entity\'s assets;   (h) all contracts relating to patents, trademarks,
trade names or copyrights or applications for any thereof, inventions, trade
secrets or other proprietary information;   (i) all contracts for the past
or present disposal of waste;   (j) the Leases;   (k) all outstanding
purchase orders or sale orders ("Sales Orders") that involve commitments of
the Business in excess of US $50,000 for MSC/SFI or US $15,000 for any
Company;   (l) all partnership, joint venture or other similar  agreements
currently in effect;   (m) all agreements relating to the acquisition
or disposition of any Real Property, any MSC/SFI Entity\'s assets or the
Business (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise)
within the past ten (10) years;   (n) all options, licenses, franchise or
similar agreements;   (o) all contracts with any affiliate,

or any relative of any of the foregoing; and   (p) all other contracts
entered into other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices, including, but not limited to, contracts (i) with suppliers
for the purchase of goods or services in excess of normal requirements or at
prices in excess of the current market price, (ii) for the sale by an MSC/SFI
Entity of goods or services at prices not   19   reasonably calculated to
produce gross profit margins consistent with those achieved by an MSC/SFI
Entity during its three (3) prior fiscal years, or (iii) which contain terms
or conditions which an MSC/SFI Entity cannot reasonably expect to fulfill in
their entirety.  MSC/SFI has delivered to Bekaert accurate and complete
copies of each Material Contract, in each case with all modifications and
amendments thereto. Each Material Contract is a valid and binding agreement
of the MSC/SFI Entity, as the case may be, and is in full force and effect.
There has been no modification or termination of any Material Contract under
circumstances which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on an MSC/SFI Entity.   3.5.3 Compliance with Contracts. With respect
to the Material  ------------------------- Contracts :   (a) None of the
MSC/SFI Entities, as applicable, is in default under or in violation of any
thereof; and   (b) no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute such a default or violation.   None of
the MSC/SFI Entities has received written notice of breach by an MSC/SFI
Entity or termination of any of the Material Contracts. To the Knowledge of
the MSC Parties, there is no default under or any violation of any of the
foregoing by any other party thereto.   3.5.4 Insurance. Section 3.5.4 of
the Disclosure Letter lists all  --------- insurance policies maintained by
any MSC/SFI Entity and identifies for each such policy the following:
underwriter, policy number, coverage type, premium, expiration date, coverage
amount and deductible. Such insurance policies protect the MSC/SFI Entities\'
and the Companies\' properties and business from losses and risks in a manner
reasonable for its business and assets and are of the type and in amounts
customarily carried by Persons conducting similar businesses or operating
similar assets for similar purposes in the localities of the businesses and
assets of the MSC/SFI Entities. All such policies are in full force and
effect and all premiums have been paid. Except for amounts deductible under
policies of insurance described in Section 3.5.4 of the Disclosure Letter or
as otherwise set forth in such Schedule, none of the MSC/SFI Entities is,
or has been at any time, subject to Liability as a self-insurer. There is
no dispute pending, and no state of facts or event which could reasonably
be expected to form the basis for a dispute, with any underwriter of an
MSC/SFI Entity insurance. In the past three (3) years, none of the MSC/SFI
Entities has received notice from any insurer threatening to cancel any
insurance coverage or requiring any changes or corrective work which has not
been satisfied. Section 3.5.4 of the Disclosure Letter also sets forth a
description of all claims pending under such insurance policies.   3.5.5
Suppliers and Customers. No supplier or customer which 
----------------------- accounted for   20   more than ten percent (10%)
of any MSC/SFI Entity\'s sales or purchases in any one of the past three (3)
fiscal years and no other supplier or customer material to any MSC/SFI
Entity\'s business (including, but not limited to, any supplier who is an
MSC/SFI Entity\'s sole source of supply of any product or service) has
terminated, or threatened to terminate, its relationship with an MSC/SFI
Entity or has during the past year decreased or delayed materially,
or threatened to decrease or delay materially, its services or supplies to
an MSC/SFI Entity or its usage of an MSC/SFI Entity\'s services or products,
and there is no state of facts or event which could reasonably be expected to
form the basis for such a decrease or delay. The transactions contemplated in
this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement will not adversely affect
the relationship of any MSC/SFI Entity with any such supplier or customer.
None of the MSC/SFI Entities is required, in the ordinary course of business,
to provide any bonding or any other financial security arrangements in
connection with any transactions with any customers or suppliers.   3.5.6
Purchases and Sales. Since February 28, 2001:  -------------------   (a)
none of the MSC/SFI Entities has made any purchase commitments in excess of
its normal business requirements; and   (b) there have been no reductions in
the aggregate dollar volume of an MSC/SFI Entity\'s backlog of Sales
Orders.   3.5.7 Prepayments and Deposits. No MSC/SFI Entity has received 
------------------------ any prepayments or deposits from customers for
products to be shipped, or services to be performed, by an MSC/SFI Entity in
the future.   3.5.8 Employee Benefit Programs. 
-------------------------   (a) Section 3.5.8 of the Disclosure Letter lists
every  Employee Program (as defined below) that has been maintained (as
defined  below) by an MSC/SFI Entity at any time during the six-year period
ending  on the Closing Date.   (b) Each Employee Program which has ever
been maintained  by an MSC/SFI Entity and which has at any time been intended
to qualify  under Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a
favorable  determination or approval letter from the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS")  regarding its qualification under such section and has, in fact,
been  qualified under the applicable section of the Code from the effective
date  of such Employee Program through and including the Closing Date (or,
if  earlier, the date that all of such Employee Program\'s assets were 
distributed). To the Knowledge of the MSC Parties, no event or omission has 
occurred which would cause any such Employee Program to lose its 
qualification or otherwise fail to satisfy the relevant requirements to 
provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable Code section (including, 
without limitation Code Sections 105, 125, 401(a) and 501(c)(9)). Each  asset
held under any such Employee Program may be liquidated or terminated  
21    without the imposition of any redemption fee, surrender charge or 
comparable liability. No partial termination (within the meaning of Section 
411(d)(3) of the Code) has occurred, or will occur as a result of the 
transaction contemplated herein, with respect to any Employee Program.   (c)
Neither the MSC Parties nor any Company knows, nor  should any of them have
reason to know, of any failure of any party to  comply with any laws
applicable to the Employee Programs that have been  maintained by the MSC/SFI
Entities. With respect to any Employee Program  ever maintained by the
MSC/SFI Entities or the Companies, there has  occurred no (i) "prohibited
transaction," as defined in Section 406 of the  Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") or  Section 4975 of the Code, or
breach of any duty under ERISA or other  applicable law (including, without
limitation, any health care continuation  requirements or any other tax law
requirements, or conditions to favorable  tax treatment, applicable to such
plan), which could result, directly or  indirectly, in any taxes, penalties
or other liability to the MSC/SFI  Entities, (ii) failure to comply with any
provision of ERISA, the Code, or  any other applicable law, or any agreement,
or (iii) non-deductible  contribution, which in the case of (i), (ii) or
(iii), could subject the  MSC/SFI Entities to liability either directly or

document of assignment contemplated herein or therein, shall constitute an

by MSC to Transferred Employees under the MSC1992 Omnibus Stock Awards Plan
for Key Employees, which includes without limitation, the MSC 1999 Long-Term
Incentive/ Leveraged Stock Awards Program, the MSC 2000 Long-Term Incentive/
Leveraged Stock Awards Program, and the MSC 2001 Long-Term
Incentive/ Leveraged Stock   41   Awards Program and which have not
become fully vested as of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Stock Awards"),
shall become vested, and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, in accordance
with the applicable terms of the agreements applicable to such Restricted
Stock Awards. On or before the thirtieth (30th) day after the Closing Date,
MSC shall distribute to the holders of each Restricted Stock Award, the
portion of the stock and cash pertaining to his Restricted Stock Award that
becomes vested as of the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 8.3.2 less all

Term Incentive/Leveraged Stock Award Program, MSC/SFI shall use its best
efforts to obtain the approval of the Board of Directors of MSC to accelerate
the vesting of the 1999 Restricted Stock Awards on a pro rata basis through

vesting of the 1999 Restricted Stock Awards, MSC/SFI shall pay to each
Transferred Employee an amount in cash equal to sum of: (i) the fair
market value of the prorated shares of stock under the Transferred
Employee\'s 1999 Restricted Stock Award using the closing price of the MSC
stock on June 29, 2001; (ii) the value of the prorated cash award; and (iii)
the forfeited investment amount made by the Transferred Employee multiplied

and the cash portion pertaining to such 1999 Restricted Stock Award by 77.8%.
Effective as of the Closing, Bekaert shall cause Newco to enter into Long-
Term Incentive Cash Award Agreements, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
8.3.2, with each of the Transferred Employees listed on Schedule 8.3.2,
pursuant to which Newco shall be obligated to pay each such Transferred
Employee a distribution in cash, but not in stock, equal to the value of the
portion of his Restricted Stock Award that did not become vested on the
Closing Date, which amount is set forth in a schedule agreed upon by the
parties.   8.3.3 EVA Plan. Effective as of the Closing and for the twelve-
month  -------- period ending February 28, 2002, Bekaert will cause Newco to
cover Transferred Employees, who are participants in the MSC EVA Improvement
and Incentive Plan (the "EVA Plan") on the Closing Date, by a plan, the terms
and conditions of which are comparable to those applicable to MSC/SFI
employees under the EVA Plan (the "Newco EVA Plan"). Pursuant to the Newco
EVA Plan, Newco will assume the responsibility to pay any bonuses, in
addition to any applicable employer related payroll taxes attributable
thereto, earned by Transferred Employees under the EVA Plan for the twelve-
month period ending February 28, 2002 in accordance with the targets and
methodology applicable to the Transferred Employees under the EVA Plan on the
Closing Date. The application of the Newco EVA Plan shall not penalize any of
the Transferred Employees as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the acquisition of NeoVac. In addition, the Newco EVA Plan
shall provide that Newco will pay to Transferred Employees the portion of
their compensation under the EVA Plan that was "banked" under the EVA Plan as
of February 28, 2001, increased or decreased for any changes in the amount
banked after February 28, 2001 and through February 28, 2002. If the Newco
EVA Plan does not continue the "banking" provisions of the EVA Plan past
February 28, 2002, then Newco shall establish a plan pursuant to which the
banked amounts will be distributed to Transferred   42   Employees over a
period not to exceed five years in accordance with terms of payment that are
comparable to those contained in the EVA Plan.   8.3.4 Employee Stock
Purchase Plans. Effective as of the Closing 
----------------------------- Date, MSC shall terminate the participation of
the Transferred Employees in the MSC Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Any
amounts withheld from Transferred Employees under such plan that have not
been applied toward the purchase of MSC stock as of the Closing Date shall be
distributed to such Transferred Employees in accordance with the terms of
such plan.   8.3.5 Merit/Stock Exchange Program. 
----------------------------   (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, MSC
shall terminate the participation of the Transferred Employees in the MSC
Merit/Stock Exchange Program. MSC shall use its best efforts to obtain the
approval of the Board of Directors of MSC to remove any and all restrictions
applicable to MSC stock awarded to such employees under such plan and, within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, shall distribute the stock to such
employees under the MSC Merit/Stock Exchange Program. Effective March 1,
2002, Newco shall increase the base salary of each Transferred Employee, who
elected under the MSC Merit/Stock Exchange Program to receive MSC restricted
stock or options in lieu of his merit increase for the fiscal year beginning
March 1, 2001, to the base salary that such Transferred Employee would have
received during the fiscal year beginning March 1, 2001 if he had not elected
to receive MSC restricted stock or options in lieu of such merit increase. If
the MSC Board fails to remove any and all restrictions applicable to such
Transferred employee pursuant to this Section 8.3.5, MSC/SFI shall pay to the
respective Transferred Employee an amount in cash equal to the fair market
value of the stock of MSC as designated for the closing price on June 29,
2001, multiplied by the number of shares each holder of the Restricted Stock
Award would have received had the restrictions been removed. This amount net
of applicable payroll taxes shall be distributed within 30 days .   (b) For
each Transferred Employee who elected to be granted stock options ("Stock
Options") on March 1, 2001 in lieu of a merit increase under the MSC
Merit/Stock Exchange Program ("Award"), MSC will honor such terms of
the agreement for such Stock Options between MSC and such Transferred
Employee. If the market price per share of MSC stock exceeds the exercise
price of the Stock Options between the Closing Date and the expiration of the
Stock Options such that had the Transferred Employee exercised the Stock
Options prior to expiration of the Stock Options (the "Expiration Date") the
value of the Award would have yielded a before tax value higher than the
Transferred Employee\'s merit increase for the twelve-month period ending
February 28, 2002, no further payment will be due to the affected Transferred
Employee. If the market price per share of MSC stock does not exceed the
exercise price of the Stock Options between the Closing Date and the
expiration of the Stock Options such that had the Transferred Employee
exercised the Stock Options prior to the Expiration Date the value of the
Award would have yielded a before tax value lower than the  
43   Transferred Employee\'s merit increase for the twelve-month period
ending February 28, 2002, MSC will pay the prorated merit increase in cash
plus interest of seven percent (7.00%) on a compounded basis from March 1,
2001 until the Closing Date; and Bekaert will increase the salary of the
Transferred Employee effective on one day after Closing Date on a retroactive
basis by such amount.   8.3.6 SERP. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Bekaert shall cause  ---- Newco to offer to cover the two Transferred
Employees, who are covered under the MSC Supplemental Retirement Plan (the
"SERP") on the Closing Date (the "SERP Participants"), under a nonqualified
supplemental executive retirement plan with terms and conditions comparable
to those applicable to each of them under the SERP, in each case conditioned
upon his agreement to release MSC from its obligations to him under the SERP.
If a SERP Participant refuses to release MSC from its obligations to him
under the SERP, then Newco shall not be obligated to provide such SERP
Participant with the benefits described in the preceding sentence and MSC
shall remain obligated to pay such SERP Participant\'s benefits under the
SERP in accordance with the terms of the SERP and the SERP agreement entered
into with such SERP Participant. If a SERP Participant refuses to release MSC
from its obligations to him under the SERP, then, on the Closing Date, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by either Eighty Eight Thousand
Four Hundred Thirty One US Dollars (US $88,431) or Sixty Nine Thousand Two
Hundred Thirty Three (US $69,233), depending upon which SERP Participant
refuses to release MSC. In addition, effective as of the Closing Date,
Bekaert will consider providing nonqualified supplemental executive
retirement plan benefits to those certain Transferred Employees who MSC/SFI
has proposed to add to the SERP as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Additional SERP Participants"). The supplemental executive retirement plan
benefits provided to the Additional SERP Participants shall be the same as
those provided to the SERP Participants on the date of this Agreement. In the
event Bekaert determines not to provide such benefits to the Additional SERP
Participants by the Closing Date as contemplated herein, the Purchase Price
shall be increased by the amount of Sixty Two Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty-
Three US Dollars (US $62,933.00).   8.3.7 Post Retirement Medical. On the
Closing Date, Bekaert shall  ----------------------- cause Newco to assume
all of MSC\'s obligations to provide post-retirement medical benefits under
the MSC Post-Retirement Medical Plan to Transferred Employees. Newco shall
adopt a plan document with terms and conditions that are comparable to those
contained in the MSC Post-Retirement Medical Plan.   8.3.8 401(k) Plan. On
or before December 31, 2001, MSC shall take  ----------- all necessary and
appropriate steps to transfer to the Newco LLC Savings and Investment Plan,
or such other qualified plan as Newco may establish (the "Newco 401(k)
Plan"), all of the assets in the MSC Savings and Investment Plan (the "MSC
401(k) Plan") associated with Transferred Employees, including
assets attributable to all employer and employee contributions, whether or

its products or services, merchandising and sales methods, and profit margins

processes, of the Business. The parties specifically stipulate that as
between them, the Protected Information is important, material and seriously
affects the effective and successful conduct of the Companies business

business entity (foreign or domestic), own, manage, control or participate in
the ownership, management or control of, provide financing or other financial
or other assistance to, or otherwise affiliate or associate (as a consultant,

the MSC Parties to Bekaert as  further inducement for Bekaert to purchase the
Membership  Interests and the NVB Intellectual Property Rights.   (a) 8.5.3
Modifications; Tolling. The parties  ----------------------  expressly agree
that if any claim is made that any covenant set  forth in Section 8.5.1 or
Section 8.5.2 above is invalid or  unenforceable, due to the duration or
geographic area thereof,  and/or otherwise, the covenant shall not thereby be
rendered  invalid or unenforceable, but it shall instead be modified to  the
maximum duration, maximum geographic area, and/or otherwise  as the
arbitrator(s) or a court examining the covenant shall  find to be reasonable
and legally enforceable. In the event a  MSC Party shall violate any legally
enforceable provision of  this Agreement as to which there is a specific time
period  during which such party is prohibited from taking certain  actions
or from engaging in certain activities, as set forth in  such provision,
then, in such event, such violation shall toll  the running of such time
period from the date of such violation  until such violation shall cease.  
(b) 8.5.4 Immediate Equitable Relief.  -------------------------- 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the  contrary, the
parties acknowledge that a violation or  threatened violation of the
provisions set forth in Section  8.5.1 or Section 8.5.2 above will result in
irreparable harm to  the Bekaert Parties, and, accordingly, the parties agree
that  the Bekaert Parties shall be entitled to institute judicial 
proceedings, seeking immediate injunctive relief (or similar  equitable
relief) against such violation or threatened  violation without any
requirement to post a bond as a condition  of such relief, as well as damages
at law as may be   48    recovered by the Bekaert Parties, and the
attorney fees it  incurs in enforcing any of the covenants contained
herein.   8.5.5 Separate Covenants; Independent Covenant. 
----------------------------------------   (a) The covenant in Section 8.5.2
above, ("Covenant") shall be construed as a separate Covenant covering
competition in each of the separate states of the United States and foreign
countries in which MSC/SFI has been engaged in business and to the extent
that it shall be unenforceable under New York law as applied by that state or
country, the Covenant shall not be affected thereby with respect to each
other state and country, the Covenant with respect to each state and country
being construed as severable and independent.   (b) The Covenant and the
covenants in Section 8.5.1 are independent of any of the covenants of the
Bekaert Parties under this Agreement and shall not be affected or impaired by
claims relating to such other covenants.   8.5.6 Joint and Several

liability under the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall be joint

Construction. This Agreement and the Contribution Agreement, 
------------ the only texts of which are in English, shall be interpreted in
accordance with the commonly understood meaning of the words and phrases
hereof in the United States of America, and they and the performance of the
parties hereto and thereto shall be construed and governed according to the
laws of the State of New York, without reference to conflicts of law
principles. No provision of this Agreement and the Contribution Agreement
shall be construed in favor of or against any party on the ground that such
party or its counsel drafted the provision.   8.6.2 Dispute Resolution. In
the event of any dispute, controversy  ------------------ or claim arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement or to a
breach hereof or thereof, whether based in contract, tort, or statute,
including its interpretation, scope, formation, performance or termination
("Dispute") the parties hereto shall attempt to settle such Dispute by
friendly discussions between any MSC Party and any NVB Party. If
no settlement is reached within thirty (30) days after one party notifies the
other party of the existence of a Dispute, then either party may select to
submit the Dispute to mediation. The demand for mediation must be submitted
by the demanding party within thirty (30) days of notice of the Dispute. The
parties may mutually agree upon a mediator (who must be experienced in the
area of the Dispute) and the rules which will apply to the mediation. If the
parties are unable to agree on either or both of a mediator or the rules to
apply to the mediation, then the parties will use the then current applicable
mediation rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution to choose the
mediator or set rules of the mediation, or both as applicable. Any mediation
will be held in New   49   York City, New York. If after seven (7)
calendar days the Dispute is not resolved, or if the mediator declares an
impasse prior to the end of such seven (7) calendar day period, then if the
parties do not mutually agree to continue mediation within two (2) further
calendar days, mediation shall terminate effective at the close of business
on such second calendar day ("Termination of Mediation"). The resolution of
the Dispute by mediation shall not be binding on either party unless the
parties mutually agree prior to the Termination of the Mediation to accept
the resolution of the Dispute achieved through the mediation. If the Dispute
is not resolved through mediation, either party may within thirty (30) days
of the Termination of Mediation submit the Dispute to arbitration in
accordance with the then-current International Rules of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration, including the rendering of
the award, shall take place in: (i) if a MSC Party initiates the arbitration
process then the arbitration shall be held in Brussels, Belgium; or (ii) if a
NVB Party initiates the arbitration process then the arbitration shall be
held in San Diego, California. In either case the applicable forum shall
be the exclusive forum for final resolution of the Dispute. The
governing procedural and substantive law of the arbitration shall be the
internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law
principles, as provided by Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations
Law. There shall be three (3) arbitrators, at least one of whom shall be
trained in the law and the other two of whom shall have prior experience in
arbitration of transnational commercial disputes. If any Dispute involves a
claim of damages for Twenty-Five Thousand US Dollars (US $25,000) or less,
the arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed by the AAA
and who shall be trained in the law. The language of the arbitration shall be
English. The arbitrators shall have no power to add to, or subtract from, or
modify any of the terms of this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement, nor
to award punitive damages. The arbitrators may award legal or equitable
relief. The MSC Parties and the NVB Parties waive any rights they may have
under the laws of any jurisdiction (1) to apply to the courts of any such
jurisdiction for relief from the provisions of this Section 8.6.2 or from any
decision of the arbitrators absent fraud, or (2) to contest the
enforceability of any arbitral award made hereunder. The MSC Parties and the
NVB Parties shall each bear its own legal fees and costs and other expenses
in connection with the arbitration and in the enforcement of any arbitral
award. Any arbitral award shall be promptly paid by the party against which
it is assessed in United States Dollars. The arbitral award shall be
enforceable under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The arbitral award shall be binding,
and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. Performance of this Agreement shall
continue unabated during the pending of any arbitration which may arise out
of a Dispute, except with regard to the matter in Dispute.   8.6.3 Equitable
Relief. Notwithstanding anything contained in this  ---------------- Article
8 to the contrary, any party to this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement
shall have the right to institute judicial proceedings against any other
party or anyone acting by, through or under any such other party, in order to
enforce the instituting party\'s rights hereunder through reformation
of contract, specific performance, injunction or similar equitable
relief.   50    8.7 Survival of Contribution and Joint Venture Formation

with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, agreement, covenant or obligation. The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of the representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of damages, or other remedy
based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations. The
expiration or limitations on a right to indemnification for breaches of
representations or warranties under Section 9.2.1 shall not impair the right
to indemnification under the other applicable provisions of Section 9.2 for
the same claim, subject to the express terms applicable to such

any legal proceedings shall be instituted or  ------------------ any claim
is asserted by any third party in respect of which the MSC/SFI Indemnified
Parties or the Bekaert Indemnified Parties, may be entitled to indemnity
hereunder, the party asserting such right to indemnity shall give the party
from whom indemnity is sought written notice thereof. A delay in
giving notice shall only relieve the recipient of liability to the extent the
recipient suffers actual prejudice because of the delay. The party from whom
indemnity is sought shall have the right, at its option and expense, to
participate in the defense of such a proceeding or claim, but not to control
the defense, negotiation or settlement thereof, which control shall at all
times rest with the party asserting such right to indemnity, unless the
proceeding or claim involves only money damages, not an injunction or other
equitable relief, and unless the party from whom indemnity is sought:  
54    (a) irrevocably acknowledges in writing complete responsibility
for and agrees to indemnify the party asserting such right to indemnity,
and   (b) furnishes satisfactory evidence of its financial ability
to indemnify the party asserting such right to indemnity,  in which case
the party from whom indemnity is sought may assume such control through
counsel of its choice and at its expense, but the party asserting such right
to indemnity shall continue to have the right to be represented, at its own
expense, by counsel of its choice in connection with the defense of such
a proceeding or claim. If the party from whom indemnity is sought does not
assume control of the defense of such a proceeding or claim, the entire
defense of the proceeding or claim by the party asserting such right to
indemnity, any settlement made by the party asserting such right to
indemnity, and any judgment entered in the proceeding or claim shall be
deemed to have been consented to by, and shall be binding on, the party from
whom indemnity is sought as fully as though it alone had assumed the defense
thereof and a judgment had been entered in the proceeding or claim in the
amount of such settlement or judgment, except that the right of the party
from whom indemnity is sought to contest the right of the other to
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to the proceeding or claim
shall not be extinguished. If the party from whom indemnity is sought does
assume control of the defense of such a proceeding or claim, it will not,
without the prior written consent of the party asserting such right
to indemnity, settle the proceeding or claim or consent to entry of any
judgment relating thereto which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant to the party asserting such right to
indemnity a release from all Liability in respect of the proceeding or claim.
The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such proceeding or
claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any audit of a Foreign Subsidiary
by a Taxing Authority of that Foreign Subsidiary\'s jurisdiction for which a
right of indemnification will be sought by the Bekaert Indemnified Parties
under Section 9.2.5, the Bekaert Parties shall give prompt notice to the MSC
Parties of the request for such audit. A delay in giving notice shall only
relieve the MSC Parties of liability to the extent the MSC Parties suffer
actual prejudice because of the delay including, without limitation, the loss
of ability to obtain an extension on any tax filing. The terms of this
Section 9.4 shall otherwise apply.   9.5 Procedure for Indemnification -
Other Claims. A claim for 
-------------------------------------------- indemnification for any matter
not involving a third-party claim may be asserted by notice to the other
party from whom indemnification is sought.   9.6 Special Procedures Relating
to Environmental Liabilities . 
--------------------------------------------------------   9.6.1 The
following procedures govern the conduct of assessment, investigatory,  
55   corrective or remedial action in connection with Environmental
Liabilities. Third party claims with respect to such matters shall
additionally be governed by applicable provisions of Section 9.4 hereof to
the extent not inconsistent with this Section 9.6. Upon assertion by a
Bekaert Indemnified Party of such a claim, Bekaert or a Company shall be
entitled to assume Principal Management of the subject matter of such claim
without the admissions of responsibility and/or liability as related to the
underlying basis of the claim. Bekaert or the applicable Company may assert
the necessary defenses as afforded under the applicable Environmental Law. In
the event Bekaert or a Company elects in writing not to undertake Principal
