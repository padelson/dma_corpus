presently exercisable or subject to additional conditions prior to exercise,
under and pursuant to the (i) 1997 Equity Incentive Plan, (ii) 2002 Stock
Plan; and (iii) 2002 Director Option Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option

" _Company Preferred Stock_ " shall mean shares of the preferred stock of
Company.



" _Company Warrants_ " shall mean all issued and outstanding warrants to

terms, is not vested and exercisable by the holder thereof as of
the Effective Time.



" _Vested Company Option_ " shall mean any Company Option that is not an
Unvested Company Option.



(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. By virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent, Company, the Merger Sub or the
holders of any of Companys securities, at the Effective Time, each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but excluding any shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c)
and any Dissenting Shares, will be automatically canceled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Consideration,
without interest.



(c) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by Company, Parent and
Subsidiaries_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that
are owned by Company as treasury stock (including any Company Preferred Stock)
and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Company shall be canceled and extinguished without
any rights to conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefore. At the Effective Time, any shares of Company Capital

any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

Company Options then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent and converted into
Parent Options in accordance with Section 5.9(a) hereof.

be canceled in consideration of payment to the holder thereof of an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Common Stock Consideration over
the exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock under such Vested
Company Option



 

3 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

subject to withholding for applicable income, employment and other taxes. No
later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time, Company agrees to
give notice to the holders of Vested Company Options as to the cancellation of
the Vested Company Options in accordance with this Section 1.6(d), subject to
reasonable review and approval of the notice by Parent.



(iii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Warrant will be
canceled in consideration of payment to the holder thereof of an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Common Stock Consideration over the
exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such Company Warrant, multiplied by the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of such
Company Warrant, in each case subject to withholding for applicable income,
employment and other taxes. Company agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) enable each holder of Company Warrants to fully exercise such
Company Warrants before the Closing; (b) effect the termination of all Company
Warrants outstanding at the Effective Time in accordance with their terms,
and (c) give any notice required under any agreements relating to Company
Warrants as to such termination.



(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Common Stock Consideration_. The Per Share
Common Stock Consideration shall only be adjusted to reflect fully the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital
Stock), reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring after the Execution
Date and prior to the Effective Time, so as to provide holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect, in the aggregate, as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, like change or increase.



(f) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.



1.7 _Surrender of Certificates_. 



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parents transfer agent, Computershare Limited, shall
act as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger.



(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in no
event more than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with
this Article 1, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, cash
in an amount sufficient to permit payment pursuant to Section 1.6(b) in
exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, less any amounts required to be withheld from such cash
under foreign, federal, state or local laws. Parent shall, from time to time,
deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional funds necessary to pay any
amounts payable pursuant to this Article 1 that have not been theretofore
deposited with the Exchange Agent.



 

4 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.



(i) As soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event more than five (5)
business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_
") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock, whose shares were converted into the right
to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereto, (1) a letter of transmittal
in customary form as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify prior to
the Closing (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Exchange Agent), and (2) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash.



(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, (A) the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash payment
pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof, without interest, and (B) the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.



(iii) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the stockholder of
the Company (the " _Company Stockholder_ ") claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will pay such Person in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, that amount of cash which
such Person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(b). When
authorizing such payment in exchange therefor, the Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give the Exchange
Agent a reasonable form of bond as indemnity, as it shall direct in accordance
with (and amounts prescribed by) its customary practices, policies and
procedures, against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed. As a further condition to payment with respect to any Certificate
that shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may require the
Company Stockholder to whom payment is to be made to agree in writing to
indemnify and hold harmless Parent with respect to any loss or expense
incurred by Parent as a result of the loss, theft or destruction of
such Certificate.



(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.



1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. After the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be exchanged and canceled as provided in this Article
1. Until Certificates representing shares of Company Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are surrendered pursuant
to Section 1.7, such Certificates will be deemed, for all purposes, to
evidence only ownership of the right to receive cash in the amounts determined
in accordance with Section 1.6(b).



 

5 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

1.9 _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
delivery and payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
" _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority (defined below) as required by
applicable law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been delivered and paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation.



1.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Company, the officers and directors of Company,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.



1.11 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Company
Stockholder who has properly demanded and perfected such stockholders
appraisal rights and demanded to be paid the fair value of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section
1.6(b), but the holder thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are granted
by Delaware Law and the Surviving Corporation shall make all payments to the
holders of such Dissenting Shares with respect to such demands in accordance
with Delaware Law; _provided_ , that if any such holder shall, prior to or
after the Effective Time, have failed to perfect or shall have lost its
appraisal right under Delaware Law, each share of Company Common Stock held by
such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the
Effective Time, solely the right to receive the cash pursuant to Section
1.6(b). Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent and Merger Sub of
any demands received by the Company for payment under Section 262 of the
Delaware Law, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub,
make any payment with respect to, settle, or offer to settle, or offer to make
any payment to settle, any such demands.

or make any statements or disclosures without the prior written approval of
the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), except as may be required by law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or with the NASD;
_provided_ , that no such consultation or approval shall be required to make
any disclosure or otherwise take any action permitted by the terms of Section

those required under HSR. Company and Parent shall each use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and
approvals under any of their respective material contracts in connection with
the Merger for the assignment thereof or otherwise. The parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,

on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating
to HSR or any other applicable antitrust or anti-competition laws of any

reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under HSR, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Parent and Company shall cooperate and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an " _Order_
"), that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation
of the Merger or any such other transactions, unless by mutual agreement
Parent and Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. Each of Parent and Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under HSR or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.6(a) or (b), Parent
shall not be required to divest any of its or its subsidiaries businesses,

to any limitation with respect to any of its or its subsidiaries businesses
(in each case including Company and its subsidiaries).



(d) Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish Parent, on or
prior to the Closing Date, with evidence satisfactory to it of the consent or
approval of those Persons whose consent or approval shall be required in
connection with the Merger under the contracts of Company set forth, or
required to be set forth, on _Schedule 2.24_.



 

39 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

5.7 _FIRPTA_. Company shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, provide Parent
with a properly executed FIRPTA Notification Letter, substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , which states that shares of capital
stock of Company do not constitute "United States real property interests"
under Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes of satisfying Parents
obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition,
simultaneously with delivery of such Notification Letter, Company shall
provide to Parent, as agent for Company, a form of notice to the IRS in
accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2)
and substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ , along with
written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to the IRS on
behalf of Company upon the Closing of the Merger.



5.8  _Legal Requirements_. Each of Parent and Company shall take all
reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on them with respect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will promptly cooperate with
and furnish information to any party hereto necessary in connection with any
such requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will take
all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with the other
parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or any registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or
other Person, required to be obtained or made in connection with the taking of
any action contemplated by this Agreement.



5.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) _Assumption of Company Options_.



(i) At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plans will be assumed by
Parent and each outstanding Unvested Company Option will be assumed by Parent
and converted into an option to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Parent
(" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (each a " _Parent Option_ "). On the Closing Date,
Company shall deliver to Parent an updated _Schedule 2.2(c)_ hereto current
as of such date. Each Unvested Company Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall retain its respective vesting schedule under the applicable
Company Stock Option Plan and its respective stock option agreement and each
such Unvested Company Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and stock
option agreement, except that (x) each assumed Unvested Company Option will be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
issuable upon exercise of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, assuming that all vesting conditions applicable to such
option were then satisfied, multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing
(A) the Per Share Common Stock Consideration by (B) the average closing price
of the Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Market System for the five
(5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date
(the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ ") and rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (y) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Unvested Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option



 

40 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Consistent with the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the documents governing the
outstanding Company Options under such plans, except as otherwise set forth on
_Schedule 5.9(a)_ , the Merger will not accelerate the exercisability or
vesting of the Unvested Company Options or the shares of Parent Common Stock
which will be subject to those options upon the assumption of the Unvested
Company Options in connection with the Merger. It is the intention of the
parties that the Unvested Company Options assumed by Parent qualify, to the
maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time, as incentive stock
options, as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the extent, and only to the
extent, the Unvested Company Options so replaced qualified as incentive stock
options prior to the Effective Time. Following the assumption of the Unvested
Company Options, all references to the Company in the Unvested Company Options
and the Company Stock Option Plans shall be deemed to refer to the Parent.



(ii) After the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of
an outstanding Unvested Company Option an appropriate notice setting forth
such holders rights pursuant thereto and such Unvested Company Option shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 5.9(a) after giving effect to the
Merger). Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of such assumed Unvested Company Options pursuant to the terms
set forth in this Section 5.9(a).



(iii) The Company Board of Directors shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the deemed disposition and
cancellation of the Company Options in the Merger. Provided that Company
shall first provide to Parent the names of its stockholders and the number of
shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options which may be subject to
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and any other information reasonably
requested by Parent and relating to the same, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the deemed grant of options to
purchase Parent Common Stock under the Unvested Company Options (as assumed
pursuant hereto).



(b) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause all
outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP to be exercised upon the
earlier of (i) the next scheduled purchase date under the Company ESPP, or
(ii) three (3) trading days immediately preceding but not including the
Closing Date (the "New Exercise Date"). In addition, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to terminate all existing offering periods under the
Company ESPP immediately after the earlier of (i) the next scheduled purchase
date under the Company ESPP, or (ii) the New Exercise Date. Any purchase
rights existing on the New Exercise Date (if it occurs) under the Company
ESPP shall be exercised on the New Exercise Date and each participant in the
Company ESPP shall accordingly be issued shares of Company Common Stock at
that time. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms
of the Company ESPP in order to ensure that no offering periods under the
Company ESPP commence after the date hereof. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the Company ESPP immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



 

41 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(c) _Employee Plans_. If requested by Parent, Company shall, immediately prior
to the Closing Date, terminate any one or more of the Plans and no further
contributions shall be made to the Plans, _provided_ , that, as conditions of
such termination, (i) Companys employees who become employees of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall receive employee benefits which in the
aggregate are no less favorable than those provided from time to time by
Parent and its subsidiaries to their respective similarly situated employees;
and (ii) Companys employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents
401(k) plan immediately following the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms of such 401(k) plan. Parent and/or Surviving Corporation shall provide
or cause to be provided that under each employee benefit plan, policy,
program or arrangement where service is relevant to a determination of an
employees eligibility to participate, vesting, or level or amount of
benefits, employees of Company who become employees of Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation shall be credited with their period of service with
Company prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and
applicable tax qualification requirements, and subject to any generally
applicable break in service or similar rules. Subject to the approval of any
insurance carrier and to the extent consistent with applicable law and
applicable tax qualification requirements, Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall make available, or cause to be made available, to those
employees of Company who become employees of Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation, medical, dental, disability and other welfare benefits plans and
programs, to the extent the same is offered by Parent generally to
its employees, without regard to any preexisting condition limitation,
actively-at-work requirement or similar limitation, _provided_ , and only to
the extent, that any analogous restriction applied to such employee under an
analogous plan of Company had been satisfied as of the Closing Date. In
determining an employees share of the cost of coverage under any plan or
program of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for the year in which the
Closing occurs, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the employee with any pre-Closing
co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee under each
comparable plan maintained by Company prior to the Effective Time for such
year. Parent shall not be required to have any preexisting condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or similar limitation waived or to
credit any pre-Closing co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such
employee unless Company (or its successor entity) or the applicable insurance
carrier makes available a HIPAA Certificate evidencing prior coverage under
the corresponding or analogous Company plan. Parent and/or Surviving
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit Companys
employees who become employees of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation to
transfer elections and nominal account balances (if any) from the flexible
spending arrangement plans of the Company to the flexible spending
arrangement plans of the Parent and/or Surviving Corporation. In the event
such plans are not sponsored by Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, Parent
and/or Surviving Corporation shall establish, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, such plans and permit the plan-to-plan transfer of such
elections and nominal account balances (if any). Parent shall honor all
elections made under Companys flexible spending arrangement plans. In the
event Parent requests Company to terminate any of the Plans, Company shall
provide to Parent executed resolutions by the Board of Directors of Company
authorizing the termination of the applicable Plan or Plans.

5.10 _____Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_ __ __.



(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any of its current or
former directors and officers (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition,
for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the
certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are
at least as favorable to the beneficiaries thereof as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate or articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by applicable law. For
purposes of this Section 5.10(a) and Section 5.10(e) below, those provisions
providing for indemnification and exculpation contained in Parents
certificate of incorporation and bylaws immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to sufficient in scope to satisfy Parents
obligations as to such indemnification and exculpation provisions if
maintained through such six (6) year period.



(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to maintain in effect the Companys existing
officers and directors liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Policy_") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
covering each such Person currently covered by the DandO Policy; _provided_ ,
that, in satisfying their obligations under this Section 5.10(b), Parent and
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums under the DandO
Policy in excess of 150% of the Annual Premium, _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Parent and the Surviving Corporation would otherwise be required to expend
more than 150% of the Annual Premium to maintain the DandO Policy during such
six-year period, then they shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to 150% of the Annual Premium.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
purchase a directors and officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff"
insurance program, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
effective as of the Effective Time, covering a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring on
or prior to the Effective Time, with such coverage to have an aggregate
coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount at least equal to the
annual aggregate coverage limits under the DandO Policy; _provided_  that the
premium for such coverage shall not exceed four (4) times the Annual Premium.
In the event that the Company purchases such a "tail" or "runoff" policy prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such "tail" or "runoff" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section
5.10(b) for so long as such "tail" or "runoff" policy shall be maintained in
full force and effect. Company represents to Parent that the amount per annum
Company paid for the DandO Policy for the period from June 1, 2005 to May 31,
2006 (the " _Annual Premium_ ") is as set forth in Schedule 5.10(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Neither Parent or the Company shall be deemed in
breach of their obligations to maintain any insurance policy



 

43 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) as to any Indemnified Party that is denied
coverage under such insurance policy by the issuer or underwriter thereof as
a result of any act or omission of an Indemnified Person in connection with
the application for such insurance policy or any claim thereunder.



(c) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries under this Section 5.10 shall be joint and several.



(d) The obligations under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the
"tail" or "runoff" policy referred to in Section 5.10(b) (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or
the "tail" or "runoff" policy referred to in Section 5.10(b) (and their heirs
and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" or "runoff" policy referred
to in Section 5.10(b) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party hereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" or
"runoff" policy referred to in Section 5.10(b) (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at
law or in equity).



(e) In the event that Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their
subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least 50% of its properties and assets to any other person, then in each
case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable),
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.



5.11 _Form S-8_. As soon as practicable and in no event more than ten (10)
days after the Closing, Parent shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Company Options assumed pursuant
to Section 5.9(a) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. Company will
cooperate and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration
statement(s).



5.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute shall become applicable to
the transaction contemplated hereby, Company and the members of the Board of
Directors of Company shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby may be
commenced as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute



 

44 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

or regulation in the transaction contemplated hereby, except, in each such
case, to the extent required in the exercise of the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of Company under applicable law as advised by independent
counsel.



5.13 _Notices_. Company shall give all notices and other information required
to be given to the employees of Company, any collective bargaining
unit representing any group of employees of Company, if applicable, and any
applicable government authority under the WARN Act, the National Labor
Relations Act, the Code, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act,
and other applicable law in connection with the transactions provided for in
this Agreement.



5.14 _Further Assurances_. Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to fulfill and cause to be fulfilled the conditions to
closing under this Agreement. Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of
another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do
and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for
effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



5.15 _Novation of Contracts or Subcontracts for any Governmental Entity_.



(a) The parties agree that novation agreements should not be necessary, but
recognize that, in accordance with certain statutes, including FAR
Subpart 42.12 et seq. and other regulations, novation or other approval of
contracts for any Governmental Entity may be requested by a contracting
officer for the full transfer and assignment of the contracts for any
Governmental Entity to Parent and that application for novation or other
approvals will not be made until after the execution of this Agreement and may
take a substantial amount of processing time.



 

(b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, if any contracting
officer requests novation of contracts for any Governmental Entity,
the parties shall cooperate in an attempt to persuade the contracting officer
that a novation is not necessary in light of the nature of this transaction.
If unsuccessful in persuading the contracting officer, however, each party
shall complete its respective portion of the documentation required for
novation of each contracts for any Governmental Entity by FAR Subpart 42.12,
involving FAR 42.1204(b), 42.1204(e) and 42.1204(f) as well as by reasonable
request of the Governmental Entity, and the Company shall deliver its portion
to Parent. On behalf of Company, Parent shall promptly submit the required
documentation to the appropriate contracting officer and provide a copy
thereof to Company. Each party will thereafter, promptly and in coordination
with the other party, respond appropriately to any requests from the
contracting officer for additional information or documentation relating to
such novation. Each party shall keep the other fully informed, on a current
and timely basis, as to the progress of the novation process and provide
copies of all letters, correspondence, and other material documents to or from
the Governmental Entity with respect thereto. If the appropriate contracting
officer (i) provides no acknowledgment of or response to the notice of change
in ownership and control within thirty (30) days, or (ii) asserts that
novation of the contracts for any Governmental Entity is required, but then
refuses to permit novation of a contracts for any Governmental Entity under
substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect at the time of the
Closing in the name of Parent and without material adverse conditions upon
either Company



 

45 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

or Parent within ninety (90) days and, (A) such decision is no longer
appealable by law or regulation, or (B) the parties jointly agree that such
decision cannot or should not as a practical matter be further pursued,
appealed, or submitted for reconsideration, the parties shall for a period of
thirty (30) days consult in good faith on how to proceed.
